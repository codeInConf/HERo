# HRVN: Fake News Differs From the Truth in Writing Style Detecting Fake News by Hierarchical Recursive Neural Networks

The implementation of HRVB in our paper: Fake News Differs From the Truth in Writing Style Detecting Fake News by Hierarchical Recursive Neural Networks

## About input data

1. We use **Stanford's GloVe 100d word embeddings** as word embedding in this paper, which is named as **glove.6B.100d.txt** in our code. The file of word embeddings can be downloaded from the webstite, [Embedding of words using Glove 100d](https://pages.github.com/).


2. For processing RST and CFT of news, you can use the code from the following website [Code for RST_and_CFG](https://pages.github.com/). Here we provide a simple example of the format of RST and CFG in the folder **/data/strtree_RST** and **/data/strtree_CFG**.
