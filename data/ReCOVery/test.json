No national toll was announced, but 81 other deaths had been reported through Monday.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city. Japan, France and Mongolia and other governments also were preparing evacuations.\n\nChina had expanded its already sweeping disease-control efforts by extending the end of this week\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, the country\u2019s busiest travel season, by three days to Sunday to keep the public at home and reduce the risk infection will spread.\n\nMongolia closed its vast border with China. Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they were barring entry to visitors from Hubei province. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide.\n\nU.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak.\n\nOn Tuesday, English-proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities were canceled. Public schools and universities have been ordered to postpone reopening following the Lunar New Year holiday until further notice.\n\nStock markets around the world were down sharply Monday as investors worried the outbreak could hurt the global economy.\n\nChina has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the new virus, most in Wuhan. More than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost involve Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan.\n\nChina\u2019s increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people \u2014 the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.\n\nThe epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.\n\nWuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.\n\nThe virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.\n\nThe virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/natural-ways-combat-flu-virus-symptoms\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-01-29","author":[],"title":"Natural Ways To Combat Flu Virus Symptoms","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_223166583.jpeg","body_text":"Influenza is caused by a virus, and there are several kinds that can give you the flu. While there is no cure for the flu, there are ways both pharmaceutically and gentler more natural approaches to help soothe flu symptoms that may help to shorten how long you are sick.\n\nIt is very important to drink plenty of water and other fluids, especially when you are not well to help your body loosen and get rid of built up mucus and phlegm to clear away. It is also very easy to get dehydrated when you are not feeling well and are not drinking or eating normally. In addition, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause water loss.\n\nTo help your body stay hydrated other than drinking water you can also drink coconut water, herbal teas, fresh juice, soups, broths, and consume fresh fruits and vegetables. You will be able to tell if you are drinking enough liquids if you have to urinate frequently, and the colour of your urine is pale yellow or clear. If your urine is deep yellow to amber you may be dehydrated.\n\nIf you are a smoker it may be best to refrain from the habit while you are ill as much as possible because it can further irritate your nose, throat, and lungs.\n\nIt is also important to get more sleep when you are sick because sleeping helps to boost the immune system which will help your body fight off the virus. If you have plans it is best to cancel those to avoid spreading the virus and to make sleep a priority to help your body get back on your feet.\n\nWarm chicken or beef bone broth is also good to consume to help stay hydrated, it will help to loosen and break up nose\/sinus congestion. Bone broth is an excellent source of natural minerals such as potassium and sodium as well as replenishing other nutrients and protein that are important to rebuilding immune cells while you are sick.\n\nZinc is important for the immune system, it helps the body make germ fighting white blood cells, and research suggests that it may help to ease cold and flu symptoms as well as help the body fight the virus while slowing down how fast it multiplies. Zinc can be supplemented or obtained through diet in sources such as red meat, shellfish, lentils, beans, eggs, dairy, lentils, chickpeas, nuts and seeds.\n\nA salt water gargle can help to soothe a sore throat and clear mucus. Boil water and let cool until at room temperature, add \u00bd teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water and gargle at the back of your throat for at least 10-30 seconds to rinse your mouth and throat. Spit out into sink and repeat 2-4 times. Please don\u2019t swallow the salt water, and don\u2019t use on children, they can safely gargle with plain water.\n\nMany herbs carry natural antiviral and antibacterial properties that can help while you are sick. Star anise is the star shaped spice that oseltamivir (Tamiflu) was extracted from traditionally. This has antiviral properties that can be effective against some strains of the flu virus. Other herbs that may help can be brewed into hot herbal green\/black teas to help soothe symptoms to mix with star anise include turmeric, ginger, garlic, and cloves. If you would like some sweetness try using honey rather than sugar, for best results try royal jelly which has been shown to have natural antibacterial and antiviral properties. Some natural health stores may even have bagged teas with all of these ingredients already combined together.\n\nEssential oils may help to protect you against certain bacteria and viruses. Tea tree oil has been shown to help combat flu viruses by slowing or stopping the rate at which the virus multiplies; research suggests it works best when used within 2 hours of infection. Adding a few drops of this essential oil to hand soap or lotions can help to stop spread at a common source, and some mouthwashes also include tea tree oil as an ingredient.\n\nOther essential oils and plants that also have natural antivirals and antibiotics include cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, geranium oil, lemon oil, thyme oil, and oregano oil. Be sure to use these oils only as directed, and do not ingest essential oil as many are toxic. Most can be used on the skin after being diluted with a carrier oil such as coconut, olive, or almond oil. Fresh dried herbs and spices can also be added to the mixtures for added benefits.\n\nEssential oils diffused into the air may also help against some strains of viruses and bacteria. However, it is not advised to use this kind of aromatherapy on children, pets, while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.\n\nFlu viruses prefer dry indoor air in which they can survive longer, and spread more easily. Colder outdoor temperatures typically lower humidity, as such using a humidifier in your home and workplace may help to reduce flu viruses in the air.\n\nSteam inhalation therapy uses hot water vapor to help loosen mucus congestion which may help to relieve swelling in the nose\/lungs, as well as soothe a dry cough, irritated nose, and chest tightness. It is best to avoid steam from water while it is boiling, and test the temperature before breathing it in to avoid scalding or burning yourself. You can even add a few drops of essential oils or medicated vapor rub to the hot water for added antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral benefits.\n\nHaving a flu that is affecting your stomach is difficult as it can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting. During this time only eat small hand sized portions of food at a time, and stick to bland foods that are easier to digest such as bananas, rice, toast, applesauce, crackers, soup, broth, and boiled potatoes. Try to avoid any food that may irritate your stomach and digestion such as caffeine, milk, cheese, spicy food, fatty food, fried foods, and alcohol.\n\nMost flu viruses will typically cause respiratory symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body aches, runny\/stuffy nose, sore throat, dry cough, tiredness, fatigue. Stomach flu viruses cause digestive symptoms such as chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps.\n\nSometimes flu viruses can lead to other health complications by triggering other viral or bacterial infections in the ears, lungs, throat and other areas to promote sinusitis, ear infections, encephalitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Those who are at an increased risk for such complications include those with other health conditions, adults over the age of 65, and children who are under the age of 5.\n\nIf you are sick with a flu virus it might be best to speak with a doctor if you have a chronic condition such as asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, heart disease, stroke, or a lung condition.\n\nIf you have a fever over 100.4\u00b0F\/38\u00b0C you should see a doctor, and you should seek medical attention if your symptoms are not improving after two weeks. Be sure to see a doctor if you are having trouble breathing, chest pains, chills or sweating, mucus that is an odd colour, blood in mucous, severe cough, or high fever.\n\nViruses can cause both cold and flu, both infections will give you a fever, and both have similar symptoms the main difference is how bad the symptoms are and how long they last. Flu symptoms are typically sudden and severe, lasting 1-2 weeks. Cold symptoms are generally milder lasting for one week or longer.\n\nMost cases of the flu will not require medical attention, if you are sick, please stay home and rest so that you don\u2019t spread it to other people at work\/school. Home remedies can help to reduce symptoms to make you more comfortable and rest more while you are ill, and the rest will have an enormous influence on how quickly you get better.\n\nQuick tip from Dr. Klatz with the scare of this novel coronavirus spreading to boost your immune system make sure that you are getting enough vitamins C and D, as well as selenium, garlic, and liquid iodine to help fight off any cold or flu viruses looking to set up camp in your body.\n\nBe sure to also read the article called \u201cCorona Virus 2020: A Global Pandemic?\u201d written by Carol Petersen RPh CNP for more tips in her editorial.\n\nAlso check out this companion article written by Dr. Ron Klatz, who is the president and co-founder of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) : https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/2020-coronavirus-report\/","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":13,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/are-officials-china-downplaying-infection-numbers\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-02-05","author":[],"title":"Are Officials In China Downplaying Infection Numbers?","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_55585362.jpeg","body_text":"Some agencies are reporting that officials in China are keeping two sets of coronavirus infections numbers: a set they let the public see, and the actual numbers. Recently this infectious disease has been spreading globally, and experts have been warning that China has been significantly understating the true numbers of infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNow apparently evidence has emerged that allegedly supports those sentiments, and this evidence appears to indicate that officials in China are keeping two sets of numbers regarding what they want the public to know about the numbers of infections and deaths and the actual numbers.\n\n\u201cAs Taiwan [News] reports in a report first spotted by user @TheHKGroup, over the weekend, Tencent \u201cseems to have inadvertently released what is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths, which were astronomically higher than official figures\u201d, and were far closer to the catastrophic epidemic projections made by Jonathan Read,\u201d reports Zero Hedge.\n\n\u201cNetizens also noticed that each time the screen with the large numbers appears, it shows a comparison with the previous day\u2019s data which demonstrates a \u2018reasonable\u2019 incremental increase, much like comparisons of official numbers. This has led some netizens to speculate that Tencent has two sets of data, the real data and \u2018processed\u2019 data,\u201d the publication to Taiwan news reports.\n\nOfficials in China claim to be updating websites such as QQ.com daily, the official numbers still list the infections to under 25,000 and it appears to be expanding at roughly 20% per 24 hour period which represents a doubling of infection every 3.5 days due to growth being compounded.\n\nObservers have noticed an inadvertent slip in the official numbers being reported by the communist Chinese government to suddenly show far higher numbers of confirmed infection and deaths being at 154,024 infections and 24,589 deaths, before being reverted back to the much lower supposedly official numbers.\n\nNaturally first reactions may think it was a typo being corrected, but there appears to be more to the official story that is not wanted to be known. The higher numbers did not appear by themselves, and they were not out of context. Above each number is an increase factor that calculates how much more the day\u2019s current numbers are compared to the previous day. For the 24,589 deaths in the lower right of the chart the number above it displays as +1546, the Chinese characters beside it explain compared to yesterday. The number above the infection count of 154,023 displays as +20979, the Chinese characters beside that similarly explain day over day increase from the previous day.\n\nThis indicates that there is an underlying database that is tracking these daily numbers that is being used to calculate differences. The numbers are being automatically calculated, if human error were to blame for inputting the incorrect numbers it would be highly unlikely that two more incorrect numbers would coincidentally also appear above those numbers to accidentally show day to day increases that are consistent with a second set of numbers being stored in parallel.\n\nOf course it could all just be some form of a typo, but it supports claims of the Chinese government having two sets of numbers relating to the coronavirus, and releasing numbers that are significantly far less than the real numbers to the public.\n\nTaiwan New Reports:\n\nSome are speculating that a coding problem could be causing the real \u201cinternal\u201d data to accidentally appear. Others believe that someone behind the scenes is trying to leak the real numbers.\n\nHowever, the \u201cinternal\u201d data held by Beijing may not reflect the true extent of the epidemic. According to multiple sources in Wuhan, many coronavirus patients are unable to receive treatment and die outside of hospitals.\n\nA severe shortage of test kits also leads to a lower number of diagnosed cases of infection and death. In addition, there have been many reports of doctors being ordered to list other forms of death instead of coronavirus to keep the death toll artificially low.\n\nW.H.O is praising China for its \u201ctransparency,\u201d but is the praise unjustified? Based on videos, reports, whistleblowers, doctors and independent journalists who are reporting from within China, it seems that officials in China are, not surprisingly, trying to significantly downplay the true number of infections and deaths associated with the outbreak of the coronavirus being shown to the rest of the world. The allegedly leaked numbers are more in line with what experts are suggesting, but it could just be a coincidence as well.\n\nAre officials in China trying to significantly downplay the true numbers regarding the coronavirus???","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/02\/06\/803523981\/coronavirus-whistleblower-dies-from-the-disease-in-china","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-02-06","author":"['Huo Jingnan']","title":"Coronavirus Whistleblower Dies From The Disease In China","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/02\/06\/gettyimages-1198896609_wide-f70dd12fd44ae9bc597cc9f3181042d86cdfff61.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Coronavirus Whistleblower Dies From The Disease In China\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Barcroft Media\/Getty Images Barcroft Media\/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 9:20 p.m. ET\n\nA Chinese doctor who was among the first to blow the whistle on the new coronavirus has died from the disease, the hospital treating him said on social media early Friday local time.\n\nLi Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist based in Wuhan, was reprimanded in early January by local police authorities for \"publishing falsehoods\" after he mentioned in a WeChat group seven cases of a virus similar to SARS from a seafood market.\n\nAsia Chinese Doctor Who Sounded Early Warning About Coronavirus Dies After Contracting It Chinese Doctor Who Sounded Early Warning About Coronavirus Dies After Contracting It Listen \u00b7 4:02 4:02\n\nNews of Li's death has triggered millions of reactions on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Most posts mourned him, called him a hero and commented with candle emojis, some with mourning poems. When Li was in critical condition late Thursday and early Friday local time, millions of people flocked to a livestream operated by local media outside the hospital, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAmong the outpouring of grief, some asked for accountability and transparency surrounding his treatment and the larger picture of authorities' response to the virus.\n\nThe topics \"Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology\" and \"We want freedom of speech\" soon began to trend on Weibo, before being deleted, CNN reported.\n\nIn a now-deleted interview with Beijing Youth Daily in late January, Li said that the report on SARS is not entirely accurate, although he didn't mean to be misleading. He also didn't mean to spread the information widely.\n\nBut he was trying to warn his old classmates, many of whom were practicing clinicians.

An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.\n\nThe pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.\n\nGiven the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world\u2019s medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world\u2019s governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.\n\nBut, for a moment, let\u2019s assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world\u2019s scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.\n\nA virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?\n\nThese are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don\u2019t have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)\n\nThose who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.\n\nFollowing is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.\n\nThere are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.\n\nIonic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper\n\nBefore antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)\n\nOzone\n\nOzone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.\n\nOxygen\/Hyperbaric Oxygen\/Hydrogen peroxide\n\nOxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.\n\nHydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen\n\nThere is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). \u201cThree Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy\u201d which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)\n\nIntravenous and Oral Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully. However, his groundbreaking work was ignored in favor of the promotion of a vaccine program. (15)\n\nUltraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence\n\nExposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920\u2019s and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner\u2019s treatments for virus infections. This time it was the advent of penicillin that became the favored treatment. In this approach only a small amount of blood is removed and exposed to light in the ultraviolet range, then the blood is returned to the body. Then there is a profound increase in oxygen, and blood immune components are improved dramatically. This treatment can be used to quell the dangerous cytokine storms and rescue patients from sepsis. The equipment and supplies are very inexpensive and treatment time is just minutes. There are practitioners who still use this therapy in their practices.(16) (17)\n\nThis article highlights some of the opportunities that can and should be implemented in managing a pandemic. Effective treatments have already been developed and abandoned, sometimes for less effective treatments. Some of these are do it yourself solutions, and most need the intervention of a skilled practitioner. Be prepared by learning where and how these therapies can be readily accessed. There is much more in that warehouse of human ingenuity. Remember the most vulnerable are the young, old, and those with existing conditions.

He took credit for making \"very good early decisions\" that helped prevent the new coronavirus from becoming more widespread in the United States.\n\n\"We're ready to adapt and ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads,\" he said, adding that he plans to add an unnamed specialist from the State Department to the White House team.\n\nTrump said he would work with Congress on funding. His administration has asked for $2.5 billion, but he said lawmakers appear amenable to offering much more money.\n\n\"Congress is making it very easy. ... It wasn't very easy for the wall, but we got that one done,\" he said.\n\nPence praised the president for the current containment strategy, including travel restrictions, quarantine measures and assembling of a coronavirus task force \"that has been meeting every day.\"\n\n\"As a former governor of the state with the first MERS case, I know full well the importance of presidential leadership and administration leadership and the vital role\" of state and local agencies, Pence said, referring to Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\nIf you can't see the video, click here.\n\nIn the latest case, the CDC said it was unclear how the patient got the virus. According to officials, the infected person reportedly did not have a history of travel to a region where the virus is spreading \u2014 or exposure to another person known to have COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC says it's possible that the person may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected.\n\nDuring the news conference, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, appeared to walk back statements made by her colleague, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who on Tuesday suggested a large outbreak is imminent.\n\nStill, Schuchat said the CDC expects more cases and cautioned local and state institutions to review pandemic preparedness plans.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the coronavirus disease COVID-19, which was first diagnosed in Hubei province in mainland China, has reached 37 other countries, according to World Health Organization officials.\n\n\"Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing in Geneva.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases globally has surpassed 81,000, according to a dashboard created by Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering. More than 30,000 of those are cases in which people recovered from COVID-19.\n\nConcern over the virus and the United States' preparedness have reached both sides of the political aisle in Washington as the administration has already run out of money in its infectious-disease rapid-response reserve fund.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Democrats and Republicans grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar as he appeared before a House Appropriations subcommittee. The administration is requesting an additional $2.5 billion to combat the respiratory virus.\n\nBut many lawmakers see that as an inadequate sum to confront the challenges of a potential health crisis and are crafting emergency response packages ranging from $4 billion to $8.5 billion.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":29,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/02\/28\/810501445\/stock-market-continues-plummet-as-coronavirus-fears-continue-rise","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-02-28","author":"['Jim Zarroli']","title":"Stock Market Continues Plummet As Coronavirus Fears Continue Rise","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/include\/images\/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Stock Market Continues Plummet As Coronavirus Fears Continue Rise\n\nFinancial markets have suffered their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. The drubbing continued as coronavirus spread and fears grew that its impact will damage the global economy.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nThere was no rest for the weary on Wall Street today. Stock prices continue to plummet with no bottom in sight. The Dow lost 1.4%, capping the worst week in the market since the 2008 financial crisis. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins us now with more.\n\nHey there, Jim.\n\nJIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: So I know people were hoping things might stabilize today, end the week with maybe less grim news. Did something happen today to send prices falling yet again?\n\nZARROLI: No, it's just a kind of a continuation of what we've been seeing all week. I mean, we read these stories about cases of the coronavirus popping up in more and more countries. A lot of companies, like Google and J.P. Morgan, are telling employees not to travel. You have companies worried about their supply chains, meaning they're not sure where they're going to get the parts they need. And you actually have places in China and Italy where whole cities and towns are under lockdown, which means no - you know, not much economic activity will take place. So you're seeing, you know, whatever happens when investors get scared about the future. They're selling stock.\n\nKELLY: And just to underline how fast this has happened, had you and I been speaking last Friday, we would've been having a really different conversation.\n\nZARROLI: Right. Right. I mean, this has happened with just stunning speed. Last week, stock prices were actually hitting records.\n\nKELLY: Yeah.\n\nZARROLI: And since then, the S&P 500 is - has actually fallen more than 13%. That is a really rapid loss. I mean, I spoke with Paul Christopher, who's head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and he says he's never seen anything like it.\n\nPAUL CHRISTOPHER: It's unprecedented, really. And certainly, in my career and even if you go back 70 years, we've never had a correction - that is to say a 10% pullback from a high - develop so quickly.\n\nZARROLI: And Christopher says this has happened so fast because the coronavirus suddenly seems to be spreading around the world so quickly. I mean, before this week, it was thought of as a China problem. Now you're seeing cases in South Korea and Iran and Italy and here in the United States. And people are worried.\n\nKELLY: President Trump likes to talk about how well the stock market has done under his administration. What is he saying about this week?\n\nZARROLI: Yeah. He has often held up the strong stock market as just another piece of evidence of how well the economy is doing under his watch. But you know, you live by the Dow; you die by the Dow. The drop this week has just wiped out all of last year's gains, and the Trump administration has basically said, you know, people need to calm down. There's no evidence that the epidemic has hurt the economy so far.\n\nHere is Larry Kudlow, who's an economic adviser to the White House, talking to reporters.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: The head of the World Health Organization today said, let us not overreact. I think that's an important point. I will make the same point on the economy. The economic side - there is no tragedy in the United States.\n\nZARROLI: And you know, there are a lot of people that share that view. They say investors are maybe panicking unnecessarily. Today, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said the fundamentals of the economy remain strong. He said if things turn bad, though, the Fed is ready to act as appropriate to support the economy, which in Fed-speak means if things get too bad, the Fed can, you know, cut interest rates.\n\nKELLY: Got it. OK. Now, we've, of course, watched the markets weather epidemics before, weather big natural disasters before. Is there an example from history that might tell us what to expect in terms of how this market might react, what it might do next?\n\nZARROLI: Yeah. I mean, I think big, sudden events can really send the stock market reeling. You look at 9\/11; you look at the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - they sent stock prices falling. And in each case, the market came back pretty quickly and actually gained ground. Now, this epidemic is different 'cause it's so hard to see the end of it. I mean, we don't know how far it's going to spread, and that's something that the stock market really just doesn't know how to deal with.\n\nHere's Quincy Krosby. I spoke with her today. She's chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nQUINCY KROSBY: Uncertainty regarding something as serious as this has a tendency to induce the kind of fear that, in the market view, is sell and ask questions later.\n\nZARROLI: So we may come back in a few months and find stocks have completely recovered or, you know, we could see more weeks like this one when stocks keep losing ground.\n\nKELLY: Thank you, Jim.\n\nZARROLI: You're welcome.\n\nKELLY: NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly say that the week's stock market losses wiped out the previous year's gains.

Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., in her opening remarks to the briefing. \"That said, I have grave concerns about the lack of transparency and unwillingness to allow public health experts to speak freely about what is happening. \"\n\nAfter reports Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence's office would be coordinating all government communications about the virus' spread, Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers at Friday's briefing that he would be backing out of a series of T.V. interviews this weekend.\n\nFauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and is among the country's leading experts on contagious diseases. He told lawmakers that the decision had to do with the changing leadership around the coronavirus this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pence was tapped by Trump to spearhead the administration's response, and the vice president's office announced Thursday that it had named a separate coronavirus coordinator.\n\n\"Dr. Fauci said that when everything changed over to the Vice President being given the authority to lead the effort, Dr. Fauci had been already booked on a number of programs,\" said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif. \"He said to everyone \u2014 I am not being muzzled, I want to clear that up.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is among the Trump administration's most vocal critics, said he believed Fauci.\n\n\"The President has made so many false statements on so many things you can't really rely on the White House, but thankfully we do have good career people at the agencies and we are going to rely on them to be candid with us,\" Schiff said. \"At the same time, I think [Fauci] should have been permitted to keep the commitments that he had made... He's among the most knowledgeable in the federal government.\"\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday that there was \"no hard and fast process\" about requiring permission from the vice president's office before making public comment, but that the administration was trying to \"coordinate our messages.\"\n\n\"No one's being stifled, no one's being told what to say,\" Kudlow told reporters inside the White House. \"You've got veterans in [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC with immense knowledge of these things, they've been through this before, and we're all ears.\"\n\n\"We want to hear what they have to say,\" he said, adding, \"there's a big difference between stifling and coordinating.\"\n\nIn an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Democratic members of Congress were only complaining about transparency regarding the coronavirus in an effort to \"bring down the president.\"\n\nHe said the administration was holding sparsely attended hearings about the outbreak weeks ago, but Democrats only started caring once impeachment proceedings were over.\n\n\"Is [coronavirus] real? It is absolutely real,\" Mulvaney said, before also noting that the fatality rate of the virus is lower than other recent global outbreaks like Ebola and SARS.\n\nMulvaney also bemoaned how media organizations have covered the outbreak, saying he recommended one way to calm the financial markets that have been in freefall this week is by \"telling people to turn off their televisions for 24 hours.\"\n\nTesting concerns\n\nAfter Friday's briefing, many members voiced frustration with the slow response from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specifically related to testing for the coronavirus.\n\nCalifornia representatives like Rep. John Garamendi, whose district includes one of the military bases where people who have been evacuated from China are being quarantined, says health officials say they have updated policies that made it difficult to test a wide range of people who presented symptoms associated with the COVID-19 virus.\n\n\"They had very strict protocols that said you cannot get tested unless you can show that you were coming from China and then exposed to those who were here that came from China,\" Garamendi told reporters after a briefing. \"That protocol prohibited testing. Ultimately, can they explain why they did it? Stupidity. That's my word, not theirs.\"\n\nGaramendi and others say they are also frustrated that there is a shortage of accurate tests available to health care workers in the U.S.\n\n\"They sat on their hands for two months,\" Garamendi said. \"Tests are readily available from Korea, now.\"\n\nOthers, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, who was a practicing physician until his election in 2003, says he is concerned that the number of cases in the U.S. will inevitably grow and the number of tests available is insufficient.\n\n\"We have kind of moved from the days of containment to mitigation,\" Burgess said. \"My understanding is that two weeks ago there was a test that was being distributed and then there was a question about the efficacy.\"\n\nIndeed, a problem with one ingredient in test kits that the CDC distributed to labs around the country created a frustrating bottleneck in testing, requiring most testing to occur at the CDC in Atlanta, as NPR's Rob Stein has reported. The CDC announced Thursday that it had resolved the issue.\n\nCongress is in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the U.S., but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was \"coming close to a bipartisan agreement.\"\n\nThe number two Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Dick Durbin, tweeted Friday that Pence reached out to him about working together.\n\nAnd on Friday, lawmakers still tried to project a sense of calm about the virus.\n\n\"People shouldn't panic,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. \"The risk right now in the United States is very low.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":40,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/official-statement-china-recommended-treatment-covid-19\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-03-05","author":[],"title":"Official Statement From China For Recommended Treatment Of COVID-19 Using Vitamin C","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_215688622.jpeg","body_text":"Confirming the reports from small independent studies and 3 clinical trials, a Shanghai hospital has announced a recommendation to use high dose intravenous treatment of vitamin C to treat COVID-19, according to the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service.\n\nThe announced official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high doses of intravenous vitamin C come as welcomed news as the virus continues to spread. The dosage recommendation will vary with the severity of illness ranging from 50-200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 16,000 mg\/kg\/day.\n\n*Note: \"Using Vitamin C\" was added to the title on April, 13, 2020.\n\nThe doses are ranging from approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mgs for an adult which is administered by an IV. Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD who is President of the Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy states that this specific method of administration is very important because vitamin C\u2019s effects are at least 10 times more powerful when taken by IV rather than orally, and that \u201cIntravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.\u201d\n\nRichard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD is the associate director for the clinical trials. We are proud to say that Dr. Cheng is a Fellow and board certified anti-aging physician by the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) as well as being a Fellow and board certified A4M Integrative Cancer Therapy. Dr. Cheng has been working closely with medical and government authorities through China and has been instrumental in facilitating at least 3 of the clinical IV vitamin C studies in China. Despite most of his work being sensored and blocked by most media Dr. Cheng has been trying to bring this information to the public and will continue his efforts to encourage more hospitals to implement IV vitamin C therapy along with high doses of oral vitamin C as well. Additionally, both Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19.\n\nComments from Dr. Cheng in February reads:\n\n\u201cVitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.\n\nThe official statement from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:\n\n\u201cOn the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).\u201d\n\nThe protocol from the Chinese government can be read here, they are not blocking this news.\n\nThen why are we not hearing more about this on the news when you can find it published online in many places, it does make one wonder. But this can be corrected at any time by people sharing the news, we have included various links that will take you to the information including the clinical trials.\n\nTo be blunt not sharing or withholding information from the public of potential treatments should be seen as negligence. Vitamin C is not new, it is available, and has been proven and used as an antiviral since the 1930s(1). Vitamin C has been injected at high doses since the 1940s(2), and has been used for influenza, SARS, and viral pneumonia in the decades since then(3).\n\n\u201cAt my hospital in Daegu, South Korea, all inpatients and all staff members have been using vitamin C orally since last week. Some people this week had a mild fever, headaches and coughs, and those who had symptoms got 30,000 mg intravenous vitamin C. Some people got better after about two days, and most had symptoms go away after one injection.\u201d (Hyoungjoo Shin, M.D.)\n\n\u201cWe need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly: Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection. When can we, medical doctors and scientists, put patients\u2019 lives first?\u201d (Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, International Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader).\n\n\u201cWe therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic,\u201d says Dr. Cheng.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":59,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/12\/815061982\/broadway-shutters-its-stages-amid-coronavirus-threat","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-03-12","author":"['Jeff Lunden']","title":"Broadway Shutters Its Stages Amid Coronavirus Threat","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/03\/12\/gettyimages-1206832479_wide-ecb259421794a1b0b2db2ba4a389a4e44c269c6e.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Broadway Shutters Its Stages Amid Coronavirus Threat\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Angela Weiss\/AFP via Getty Images Angela Weiss\/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTo stem the spread of coronavirus, New York's major cultural institutions announced they would be suspending performances or closing their doors, beginning Thursday.\n\nCiting the need for \"drastic measures,\" Gov.

Six shows were to open before the end of March, while nine others were scheduled to open before April 23, the deadline to qualify for Tony Awards.

They were scheduled to have two more three-game weekends before the end of the season.\n\nWhen the Wolves will face those exams is now unknown.\n\nThe American Hockey League joined the NHL and other prominent U.S. sports leagues in suspending its season Thursday due to concerns over the coronavirus.\n\nThe Wolves had key divisional games against San Antonio (Friday), Rockford (Saturday) and Manitoba, but they have been postponed. The team cited recommendations from Gov. Pritzker and top health officials in announcing all remaining home games will be suspended, in a release that came out before the league itself revealed its decision.\n\n\u201cGovernor Pritzker has been working with leading public health experts to determine the best courses of action to prevent the further spread of COVID-19,\u201d Wolves chairman Don Levin said in a statement. \u201cWe believe whole-heartedly in Gov.

Using some of the incorrect information that has been provided the COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that is no worse than the seasonal flu, and some of those responses claim that it this a hoax and media coverage of the virus is nothing more than a part of a political conspiracy.\n\nMuch of this messaging and narrative comes from tossed off tweets, impromptu public statements, and public announcements. In reality global health officials are raising growing concerns about the outbreak and efforts to play down COVID-19 which has officially been called a pandemic by W.H.O. To add to the play down efforts they are being greatly amplified by the multi-platform propaganda apparatus that are lobbying for (re)election ranging from administration communications, to keyboard commandos, meme warriors of the internet, prime time partisans, to campaigns running on places such as Facebook. Wherever it may be appearing the overarching false message is still the same: Pay no mind to the fake news and fear mongering about COVID-19 as it is lies and political hype, everything is fine.\n\nAny who choose to open their eyes and actually look for themselves can see the overwhelming truth in plain sight. Actual trained scientists, experts, and fact checkers are desperately scrambling to try and correct misleading information. In America according to the CDC: NO the virus has not been contained, that is an impossible task, NO testing is not widely available to anyone who wants it. Most importantly this is not similar to the common cold or flu meaning most definitely NO people should not go to work or school if they are feeling ill.\n\nBut the misleading responses to the outbreak unfortunately seem to have resonated even in America as a Quinnipiac University poll released this week has found that only 35% of Republicans are concerned about the virus compared to 68% of the Democrats, and it couldn\u2019t be at a worse time as this could help further the spread of COVID-19 rather than slow it\u2019s spread to help containment efforts.\n\nGlobal responses to this outbreak are also drawing some comparisons to that of the autocratic regimes in Iran and China where they tried to deny any issue and tightly control all information of detriment to the local population and watching world. What some administrations are showing is that they don\u2019t need to force silence of actual experts, scientists, and researchers of W.H.O or even the CDC or the press to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis that is actually true and on a global scale, no they can simply step on a soap box and use a bullhorn to drown out anything true or not.\n\n\u201cTotal containment isn\u2019t in the cards, '' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \u201cGiven the nature of this virus and how it\u2019s spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down\u2026 We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.\u201d\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE \u201cWe\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nAccording to W.H.O the virus will cause a mild respiratory infection in about 80% of those infected, about half will have pneumonia and another 15% will develop severe illness with at least 5% needing critical care. W.H.O stresses that fundamental public health interventions can still help to limit the spread and drive down cases of transmission even in areas where it is spreading rapidly as the work from authorities in China, Singapore, and South Korea are showing.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector \u2014 so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight,\u201d says W.H.O Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who said that this is the first coronavirus to reach pandemic levels and also said \u201cwe have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\u201d Tedros said Wednesday. 90% of the cumulative cases have been reported in 4 countries is evidence that the rest of the world still had time to prevent an explosion of cases with action.\n\nOfficials from W.H.O. stress that countries should be implementing a strategic combination of containment and mitigation measures that involves trying to detect and stop chains of transmission with isolation and quarantines as well as community level steps such as social distancing to limit the possibility of broad spread from unknown sources that may not be able to be traced or tracked. W.H.O is eminently dismissing questions that efforts such as this are too costly or resources intensive given what could happen if countries do not slow the spread of this disease.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is successful are the fundamentals of public health,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. \u201cBy protecting themselves, they\u2019re preventing the onward transmission, which may lead to another vulnerable person,\u201d while no one is immune, those who are more vulnerable include older and younger populations and those with existing health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nMike Ryan, the head of the WHO\u2019s emergency program admits that public health interventions will not stop the virus dead in its tracks but it will help to slow the spread and flatten the curve to avoid adding burden to an overwhelmed health system.\n\nTedros points to the lack of some countries in resources, capacity and resolve as their officials have been arguing for weeks that some are not moving quickly enough to prepare for an outbreak. While Tendros declined to criticize individual member states publicly, there was note of failures of some countries to trace contacts, communicate clearly, test widely, and failure to coordinate among agencies as well as between federal governments and states, etc.\n\n\u201cYou know who you are,\u201d Ryan said about the countries that were not responding adequately.\n\nThis seems to strike home here in the United States where American responses are obviously hampered by more than one of these problems such as most notable the lack of available testing. America, the world is watching and will, no IS documenting accordingly.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":72,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/coronavirus-in-europe-by-the-numbers\/","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-03-13","author":"['Arnau Busquets Gu\u00e0rdia', 'Hanna Pawelec']","title":"Coronavirus in Europe: Live data tracker","image":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Coronavirus-by-the-numbers-feat02-945x628.jpg","body_text":"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":75,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/14\/science\/animals-coronavirus-vaccine.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-03-14","author":"['James Gorman']","title":"These Lab Animals Will Help Fight Coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/03\/13\/science\/13VIRUS-LABANIMALS1\/13VIRUS-LABANIMALS1-facebookJumbo.jpg","body_text":"Among the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom. We get diseases from other animals, and then we use more animals to figure out how to stop the diseases. As research ramps up treatments and vaccines, animals are crucial to fighting the pandemic.\nThere are different animals at each end of the pandemic, of course. The new disease almost certainly began with a bat virus, scientists agree. That virus probably passed through another animal, perhaps pangolins, on its way to humans.\nBut the animals that scientists will depend on in the lab are mice, first of all, and then perhaps ferrets or hamsters or monkeys. Around the world, different laboratories are racing to breed stocks of mice genetically engineered for research and testing the susceptibility of other animals to infection with the virus that causes Covid-19.\nThere are, of course, many objections to animal testing, particularly when it comes to primates, but researchers are deeply concerned about the hazards to humans of treatments or vaccines that have not been tried on other animals first.\nNo single kind of animal will serve all test purposes and scientists have several criteria for what makes an animal useful in testing therapies and vaccines for effectiveness.\nFirst, it must be susceptible to infection, and not all animals are. Despite the quarantining of one dog in Hong Kong, with a \u201cweak positive\u201d test for coronavirus, various health agencies are not taking a single, ambiguous result as evidence for concern. Advisories state there is no evidence yet that pets are susceptible to the disease.\nAnd even when laboratory animals are susceptible to infection, that doesn\u2019t mean they get sick. \u201cMost of them, they don\u2019t care at all that they\u2019re infected,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who developed a mouse in 2003 that was susceptible to infection with the SARS virus. It is called the hACE2 mouse.\nIf an animal doesn\u2019t get sick from the infection, its use is limited, because testing treatment effectiveness requires observing whether the treatment stops the symptoms.\nThe best laboratory animal would not only get infected and get sick, but get sick in the same way that humans do, showing a similar course of disease. Then a test would give the most information.\nDr. Perlman pointed out that the hACE2 strain of mice susceptible to SARS got sick, \u201cbut developed a brain disease\u201d in addition to other symptoms. A new study from China, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that these mice do get infected with the new pandemic virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, and develop mild pneumonia. The paper made no mention of the virus affecting the brain.\nThis strain of mice will be used in some of the first laboratory experiments. But first it is necessary to breed them. Like many other genetically engineered mice varieties, scientists don\u2019t keep live colonies on hand. Instead the mice\u2019s frozen sperm and embryos are kept ready.\nThe hACE2 mice were put on ice when the SARS outbreak stopped in the early 2000s. Chien-Te Tseng at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who independently developed an hACE2 mouse, is now building up a colony from frozen embryos in his lab. Mice have a three-week gestation period, or pregnancy, and take eight weeks to reach sexual maturity.\nDr. Perlman is not rejuvenating the strain himself. He sent 16 vials of frozen sperm to the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the biggest breeders of laboratory animals, so they can ramp up their production.\nThey hope to have mice ready for distribution, at cost, by May, according to Cat Lutz, director of the mouse repository, with responsibility for thousands of strains of mice, including the hACE2.\nThe advantage of this strain is that it has a human receptor on its cells called an ACE2 receptor, thus its name. That allows it to be infected with SARS and the new coronavirus, which both target that receptor as they try to invade cells.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge demand,\u201d Dr. Lutz said, \u201cnot only in the United States, but globally.\u201dDr. Lutz said that researchers at the Jackson Laboratory will also be investigating other ways to make mice more susceptible to the new coronavirus.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never only one mouse model that we use.\u201d For diabetes she said, \u201cwe have eight different models that we\u2019ll look at depending on the answer that we want to ask. And I think the same is going to be true in this circumstance as well.\u201d\nDr. Michael Diamond, in infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, is also planning to do research with the hACE2 mouse, and other strains.\nHe said that although mice take time to breed, creating a supply of them is still quicker than using larger animals. Mice, he said, may help scientists \u201cto sort of winnow down some of the candidates\u201d for vaccines.\nDr. Diamond also said that groups around the globe are pursuing many of the same goals. At first it might seem redundant, but because there are so many unanticipated problems that arise in vaccine and treatment tests, redundancy is a feature of the scientific process rather than a drawback.\nInevitably, he said, vaccine and treatment researchers will move to other animals, perhaps hamsters and ferrets, but certainly monkeys, which are most likely to replicate how the disease progresses in humans. All work with the live virus takes place in level 3 biosecure labs, Dr. Diamond said.\nDave O\u2019Connor, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is working with colleagues to test the usefulness of monkeys in the study of coronavirus treatments. He said that a Chinese group had already published some data on rhesus macaques and he had heard that more results from other labs around the world would be coming soon.\nThose results would be on the suitability of primates for laboratory tests, not on immediate cures. \u201cThis is not the movie \u2018Contagion\u2019 where there will be a magic discovery in a monkey that allows everyone to recover immediately,\u201d he said.\nHe added that, \u201cWe are potentially going to be dealing with this for a really long time and need to come to better terms with that.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":80,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/16\/21181915\/synth-apps-free-moog-korg-kaossilator-minimoog-model-d-coronavirus","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-03-16","author":"['Dani Deahl']","title":"Moog and Korg are offering synth apps for free while we\u2019re all stuck at home","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/65ztTPhRQ9SxxRz8cZ1gaha8rZQ=\/0x16:640x351\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19811230\/dims.jpg","body_text":"As the coronavirus pandemic has shut down clubs, parties, and festivals around the world, there are heaps of musicians (and music lovers) now sitting at home trying to find ways to fill their time.

Kaossilator is mainly for making tracks based on layering loops and has a ton of tools for playing around with 150 built-in sounds. Also, there are ways to lock scale and key so you can noodle around without any musical knowledge and make something that sounds decent. This app normally costs $19.99 and is free until March 31st.\n\nMoog said the move was done to \u201cspread positivity, creativity, and expressivity,\u201d while Korg says the offering is a way to \u201chelp you with a musical way to occupy your mind.\u201d\n\nIf you want to get even more down the rabbit hole, there are a few other free synth apps for iOS, like AudioKit\u2019s Synth One and Tenacious Frog\u2019s TF7 Synth (which is free, but offers in-app purchases).

On April 12, the U.S. became the nation with the most deaths globally, but there are early signs that the U.S. case and death counts may be leveling off, as the growth of new cases and deaths plateaus. The pattern isn't consistent across the country, as new hot spots emerge and others subside.\n\nTo see how quickly your state's case count is growing, click here.\n\nLoading...\n\nClick here to see a global map of confirmed cases and deaths.\n\nIn response to mounting cases, state and federal authorities have emphasized a social distancing strategy, widely seen as the best available means to slow the spread of the virus. Most states have put in place measures such as closing schools and nonessential businesses and ordering citizens to stay home as much as possible.\n\nIt's not clear how long such measures need to be in place to see a lasting effect. In Wuhan, the city in China where the virus originated, a strictly enforced lockdown and widespread testing have slowed the outbreak dramatically, enough to bring an end to the 76-day lockdown.\n\nA large portion of U.S. cases are centered on New York City. Since March 20, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey have accounted for around 50% of all U.S. cases. As of April 9, nearly 60% of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in these three states. While New York state appears to be reaching a plateau, as seen below, it notched between 8,000 and 10,000 new cases each day between March 31 and April 12.\n\nTo understand how one state's outbreak compares with another's, it's helpful to look at not just the daily counts but the rate of change day over day. In the following chart, we display cases on a logarithmic scale, meaning that every axis line is 10 times greater than the previous one. This type of scale emphasizes the rate of change.\n\nWhen case counts grow very quickly, a state's curve trends sharply upward, as New York's does over the first 15 days past 100 cases. Generally, this is evidence of unbridled community transmission of the disease. As new cases slow, the curve bends toward horizontal, showing that the state's outbreak may be leveling off. This doesn't mean the number of cases has stopped growing, but the rate of growth has slowed, which could signify that social distancing measures are having an effect.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn some areas, there are signs of hope. The areas with the earliest outbreaks \u2014 such as California and Washington \u2014 seem to be having success at suppressing the disease. The outlook in Washington has improved to the point that the state has returned unused Army hospital beds it had received in preparation for a peak in cases.\n\nElsewhere, limited access to testing may make the number of cases look smaller than it really is. As testing becomes more readily available, we are likely to see the number of confirmed cases continue to grow, even if not at the pace previously seen.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe data used here are compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University from several sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the World Health Organization; national, state and local government health departments; 1point3acres; and local media reports. The JHU team automates its data uploads and regularly checks them for anomalies. State-by-state testing and hospitalization data are still being assessed for reliability.

What do health officials mean when they recommend \u201cself-quarantining\u201d or \u201csocial distancing\u201d?\nAs the coronavirus spreads around the world, new terms are entering the lexicon \u2014 and we\u2019re here to help. Here\u2019s a guide to the words and phrases you need to know to keep informed of the latest developments.\nPandemicLast week, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic after it spread across six continents and more than 100 countries. A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease that affects large numbers of people. The W.H.O. had avoided using the word before Wednesday because it didn\u2019t want to give the impression that the disease was unstoppable.\n\u201cPandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,\u201d Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O., said at a news conference.\nCovid-19The technical name for the coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory disease it causes has been named the \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019,\u201d or Covid-19.\nCoronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling the sun\u2019s corona. Coronaviruses are among a large number of viruses that are common in people and many animals. The new virus, first detected in China, is believed to have originated in bats.\nWhile antibiotics don\u2019t work against viruses, researchers are testing drugs that could disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.\nFlattening the curveThe term refers to a curve in a chart that shows when a surge of new coronavirus cases are expected to strike and illustrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it.\nAn illustration by the visual-data journalist Rosamund Pearce, based on a graphic in a C.D.C. paper titled, \u201cCommunity Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza,\u201d showed what Drew Harris, a population health analyst at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, called two epi curves.\nThe high curve showed a peak indicating a wave of coronavirus outbreak in the near term; the other had a flatter slope, indicating a more gradual rate of infection over a longer period of time.\nSlowing and spreading out the tidal wave of cases will save lives.State of emergencyA state of emergency can be declared during natural disasters, epidemics and other public health emergencies. Declaring a state of emergency, as more than a dozen states \u2014 including New York, New Jersey and Michigan \u2014 have done, gives government officials the authority to take extra measures to protect the public, such as suspending regulations or reallocating funds to mitigate the spread of a disease.\nRead more about those powers here.\nSocial distancingThe virus can easily spread in dense places \u2014 in a packed subway car, for example, or at a rally or concert.\nSocial distancing refers to measures that are taken to increase the physical space between people to slow the spread of the virus. Examples include working from home, school closings and the postponement or cancellation of mass gatherings, such as the South by Southwest music, technology and film conference.\nBy maintaining a distance of six feet from others when possible, people may limit the spread of the virus.\nSelf-quarantineThis is key to keeping the virus from spreading, along with measures like social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing masks.\nWhile isolation refers to separating sick people from people who aren\u2019t sick, quarantine refers to the separation and restriction of movement of people who were exposed to the virus to see if they become sick.\nWho should self-quarantine? If you\u2019ve left an area with widespread or continuing transmission, including China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, you should self-quarantine at home for a period of 14 days from the time you left, according to the C.D.C.\nWhile in quarantine, you shouldn\u2019t receive any visitors and must stay three to six feet from others at all times.\nAccording to the C.D.C., once someone has been in isolation for 14 days and hasn\u2019t become ill, he or she is not considered to be a risk to other people.\nIncubationThe incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected. This time can be critical for prevention and control, and it allows health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus.\nThe new coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days, according to the C.D.C., with symptoms appearing about five days after infection in most cases.\nDuring the incubation period, people may shed infectious virus particles before they exhibit symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus.\nFatality rateThe case fatality rate is the number of deaths divided by the total number of confirmed cases. Eventually, scientists hope to have a more comprehensive number called the infection fatality rate, which includes everyone who was infected with the virus.\nThe W.H.O. estimates the fatality rate of the new coronavirus to be about 3 percent, based on current data, but experts suggest 1 percent is more realistic.\nR-naughtThe R-naught, or R0, is a virus\u2019s basic reproductive number \u2014 an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness of infectious agents.\nAt its simplest, the basic reproductive number can show us how worried we should be about infection, according to Dr. Adam Kucharski, a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. If the R0 is above one, each case is expected to infect at least one other person on average, and the virus is likely to keep spreading. If it\u2019s less than one, a group of infected people are less likely to spread the infection.\nResearch is still in its early stages, but some estimates suggest that each person with the new coronavirus could infect between two and four people.\nContainmentThe virus\u2019s high transmission rate has made it difficult to effectively contain the outbreak. Containment refers to the use of any available tools to mitigate the spread of a disease, said Adam Ratner, the director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health.\nEarly on, the Trump administration sought to slow the spread of the virus by barring entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. While that measure may have bought the government time to prepare, the administration made key missteps in its efforts to make widespread testing available in the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.\nDr. Ratner says the coronavirus is particularly hard to contain because it is \u201creasonably transmissible,\u201d and some people who don\u2019t have a lot of symptoms can still pass the virus to others. \u201cThat\u2019s been part of the problem,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it also points to the fact to how interconnected we all are and how quickly this thing spread from Asia to the rest of the world.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":99,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/article\/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-03-18","author":"['Ron Lieber', 'Tara Siegel Bernard']","title":"Your Money: A Hub for Help During the Coronavirus Crisis","image":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsgraphics\/2020\/04\/09\/corona-virus-social-images-by-section\/assets\/YourMoney_promo.jpg?u=1589580078218","body_text":"If your income has fallen or been cut off completely, we\u2019re here to help. This guide will connect you to the basic information you\u2019ll need to get through this, including on government benefits, free services and financial strategies. This guide has been updated with the details of the $2 trillion relief plan that has been enacted by Washington.\nIf you have a question that we have not answered about various forms of relief \u2014 or something you can offer that large numbers of people can access \u2014 please write to hubforhelp@nytimes.com. Ron and Tara will read every message.\nStimulus ChecksThe giant economic stimulus package will enable the federal government to begin making the payments, though the amount you receive will depend on your income.\nSingle adults who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full $1,200, while married couples with no children and earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, you get another $500.\nPeople who earn more will see their payments decrease until they phase out completely. That happens for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. There are other situations that make certain people ineligible \u2014 college-age children who were claimed as dependents on their parents\u2019 returns won\u2019t receive a check, for example. And you generally need a valid Social Security number to collect as well.\nMany people don\u2019t have to do anything to receive the payment. If the Internal Revenue Service already has your bank account information from your 2018 or 2019 tax returns, it will transfer the money to you via direct deposit based on the recent income-tax figures it already has.\nPayments started landing in mid-April, but it could take a few months more for some people to get them, despite the government\u2019s removal of some hurdles. You can find out more about checking on the whereabouts of your payment here.\nUnemployment InsuranceThe new relief package made significant, albeit temporary, changes to the way the unemployment insurance system works and increases benefit amounts until July 31.\nUnder the plan, these state programs now cover far more people than are usually eligible, including self-employed people and part-time workers.\nThe plan also makes exceptions for people who cannot work for a variety of coronavirus-related reasons \u2014 and you don\u2019t necessarily need to lose your job to qualify. If you\u2019re quarantined or have been furloughed \u2014 if you\u2019re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually \u2014 you may be able to get unemployment insurance.\nStates set many of their own rules, including for benefit amounts, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces roughly 45 percent of your lost income.\nMost states pay benefits for 26 weeks, though some states have trimmed that back. (This primer provides more information about how the program usually works when the country isn\u2019t struggling to contain a pandemic; eligibility rules have changed since this was last posted.)\nThe new law temporarily increases the amount of benefits by $600 weekly. It also extends by up to 13 weeks the time period for which state-level benefits are available for many workers. Here\u2019s a helpful illustration that breaks down how the program works in New York state.\nPaid Sick Leave and Family LeaveThe coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the outbreak, but there are lots of exceptions.\nMost workers at small and midsize companies, as well as government employees, can get two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they\u2019ve been employed at least 30 days. They can receive their full pay, up to $511 a day.\nSome workers can also get 12 weeks of paid leave to care for children whose schools are closed, or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak, but fewer workers qualify for this type of leave. They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.\nPart-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed \u2014 including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers \u2014 can also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily income and claim it as a tax credit.\nThere are gaps, though. Employers with fewer than 50 workers can deny workers the child-care leave (but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses, and companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules entirely. Many workers at big businesses already have paid sick leave, but their low-wage workers are the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published a detailed list of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers, restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.\nAnd these changes aren\u2019t permanent \u2014 the leave law expires Dec. 31.You can find out more from the Department of Labor, which has posted a fact sheet for workers and a Q&A.\nFederal Student LoansIf you have a federal student loan, you should automatically receive some relief without lifting a finger: Borrowers will be placed in so-called administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making payments from March 13 until Sept. 30.\nNo interest will accrue during the administrative forbearance period. (Usually interest continues to pile up when borrowers pause their payments because of a hardship.) Interest you accrued before the period began will also not be rolled into your loan principal,  according to a Department of Education spokeswoman.\nBorrowers who want to continue making loan payments can do so \u2014 and you may end up paying the balance down faster if the full amount of your payment can be applied to your loan\u2019s principal.\nThe Education Department says loan payments that are skipped under the administrative forbearance will still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in income-driven repayment and public service loan forgiveness programs, as long as the other usual requirements are fulfilled. Your loan servicer will have more details.\nBut keep in mind that for now, this relief applies only to federal student loans owned by the Education Department, such as direct loans (including those in default). Loans issued through state agencies and others, including big private lenders like Sallie Mae, are not covered. Other loans not covered include the majority of Federal Family Education Loans, which are mostly held by commercial lenders, and school-held Perkins loans.\nSome private lenders are offering relief programs. Sallie Mae said it was offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower\u2019s credit. Another, Navient, made an identical offer for \u201cqualified\u201d borrowers; a spokesman said you just need to contact the company and explain how your financial situation had changed. A third big private lender, Wells Fargo, says it will offer help, but a spokesman said the bank would not commit to a set number of months or any other specifics.\nIf you have more questions, check out the Education Department\u2019s Q&A here. It addresses what to do if you have auto-debit payments (they\u2019re suspended during this period), are trying to rehabilitate a defaulted loan, and more.\nTo see if your loans are eligible for this temporary pause, try contacting your loan servicer \u2014 the company where you send monthly payments \u2014 online or by phone. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact it, go to StudentAid.gov\/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; T.T.Y. for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for more help.\nMortgages and RentMillions of homeowners have already pressed the pause button on their mortgage payments, now that their financial lives have been upended by the pandemic.\nUnder the CARES Act, homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government are permitted to temporarily suspend their payments, a move called a forbearance, for up to a year. This covers about 70 percent of mortgage holders and includes loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (known as F.H.A. loans), and those guaranteed by the Department of Veterans and the Department of Agriculture.\nAfter the forbearance period is over, however, the skipped payments must be paid back. And how that is done will vary depending on your personal circumstances \u2014 and who owns your loan. About 30 percent of mortgage holders have loans owned by banks or private borrowers, and their options aren\u2019t always clear.\nIf you have a federally backed loan, you should be presented with several different ways to become current on your mortgage \u2014 and none of them require you to immediately pay the money back in a lump sum (but you can if you want to). If you can afford to resume your regular payments, you might pay the money back over several months, for example, or settle up when the home is sold, refinanced or when the mortgage term is up.\nPeople who cannot afford to make their mortgage payments after the forbearance period expires will probably have to modify their loan (to lower the monthly amount), a more formal process that will require an application.\nTo find out which entity may control your mortgage, you can search your address on various government websites. And if you don\u2019t feel like you are being treated fairly \u2014 or are simply overwhelmed by the process \u2014 it might help to find a housing counselor. For more information, check out our short resource guide here.\nFederal housing officials have also announced a nationwide eviction and foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with loans backed by Fannie, Freddie and the F.H.A. This includes foreclosures that are already in progress.\nA coalition of mortgage industry groups representing banks, finance companies and others has said it will also grant payment suspensions of at least three months \u2014 and up to 12 months \u2014 to homeowners whose loans are not owned by Fannie or Freddie, but they have said their effort requires a federal backstop.\nIf you rent, the best national resource we\u2019ve found so far is the search-by-state function on Justshelter.org. This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. Just Shelter\u2019s founders are Matthew Desmond, the author of the book \u201cEvicted,\u201d and Tessa Lowinske Desmond. Mr. Desmond is also the founder of Eviction Lab; it is publishing a list of local and regional actions to pause evictions of renters.\nThe emergency stimulus bill put a temporary, nationwide eviction moratorium in place for any renters whose landlords have mortgages backed or owned by Fannie, Freddie or the F.H.A. This will last through the end of July, and landlords can\u2019t charge any fees or penalties for nonpayment of rent either. The moratorium applies only to eviction for nonpayment; tenants can still be evicted for other reasons.\nRegulators have also told landlords whose own mortgages are owned by Fannie or Freddie that they too can use forbearance, just as long as they do not evict tenants after they pause their mortgage payments. The challenge for renters is figuring out whether their landlord has such a mortgage. This information sometimes appears if you look up the address in the National Housing Preservation Database.\nIf the landlord\u2019s mortgage is not in forbearance, renters who skip payments could be risking eviction if there has not been a local prohibition. (New York, for example, has suspended eviction actions until further notice.)\nUtility BillsSome utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment.A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small business customers who can\u2019t pay their bills: AT&T, Comcast, Cox, RCN, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. A full list of companies is available on the Federal Communications Commission site.\nIt is not yet clear whether companies want customers to call to invoke this relief and provide proof or whether they will offer it automatically to everyone. People who need help should call and ask.\nA number of water service providers have either suspended shut-offs for nonpayment or don\u2019t shut service off for late payments generally, according to a ProPublica roundup. They include Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Long Beach, Calif.; Los Angeles; Newark; New York City and St. Louis.\nIn Washington state, the main Seattle area utilities are suspending cutoffs as well. In addition, the provider of electric and water service in Seattle is allowing people to self-certify their recent income reductions in order to qualify for at least half off their bills.\nIn California, Pacific Gas and Electric has, until further notice, stopped shutting off its services to consumers and businesses who have not paid.\nIn New York, Con Edison also has temporarily suspended any electric and gas service shut-offs.If utilities in other areas follow suit, they are likely to publish alerts somewhere on the top of their websites or in the news release section of their pages.\nMore Helpful AdviceYou have three extra months to file your federal income taxes. The federal government has moved the tax filing deadline to July 15. You don\u2019t have to file your return or make payments until then. If you are owed a refund, you\u2019ll still receive it as normal when you file your tax return, no matter when you submit it. Don\u2019t forget about your state income taxes: The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is tracking state changes on its website. And there may not be any extension on your property taxes, according to an article by our colleague Ann Carrns; local governments are simply too hard up for money.How to help. We\u2019ll be adding more resources soon both for people who want to donate and those who may be in need of assistance from a nonprofit. Our colleagues have already written about ways to give away a stimulus check and online direct giving. The New York Times\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund has started its own relief campaign.

Eleven states, including some hit hard by the coronavirus \u2014 like California, New York and Washington \u2014 have opened enrollment under the Affordable Care Act to allow laid-off workers to get subsidized health insurance. In May, the I.R.S. issued guidance for employers that want to allow employees to change health insurance coverage and flexible spending contributions without waiting until the usual open enrollment period. And here is a more general guide to getting or keeping insurance, with updates on very recent rule changes.Should you stop 401(k) contributions if you still have a job? Maybe not. Yes, market crashes are nauseating, especially if you have not experienced one. No one can say for sure when the market will stabilize, but time is in your favor: You have years \u2014 decades, even \u2014 to reap returns when the market rises again. Need another pep talk?

And our government should do this,\" Andrew Yang told CBS News in a phone interview on Friday. \"[This fund] exists to demonstrate the power of these ideas, so we started giving money out immediately.\"\n\nYang is no stranger to cash stipends. Before the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., Yang, then a presidential candidate, proposed granting every adult American monthly payments of $1,000, turning the concept of \"Universal Basic Income\" into a household name, for many. His presidential campaign launched a \"Freedom Dividend Pilot Program\" to test and promote his signature policy, in December 2019.\n\nYet distributing cash fast to 1,000 households brought to light larger logistical problems amid CDC-mandated social distancing. \"It actually took us a little while to figure out how we could give that money effectively to people in the Bronx who needed it,\" Yang said. \"The tricky thing is actually trying to get money to people who need it at a time when you know you shouldn't be knocking on doors.\"\n\nWhile the former presidential candidate initially reached out to Citigroup and J.P. Morgan for assistance, privacy regulations prevented the entrepreneur from partnering with banks. Ultimately, the nonprofit teamed up with Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners and the Collective Education PAC to distribute stipends, targeting struggling families as businesses furlough hourly employees, faced with the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe group will also work hand in hand with One Fair Wage (OFW), contributing to the \"Emergency Coronavirus Tipped and Service Worker Support Fund\" to benefit service workers across New York City who are stifled by the economic shutdown.\n\n\"With the closing of all of the bars and restaurants, and now, essentially nail salons and gyms and everything else, New York has tens, even hundreds of thousands of service workers who now don't have a source of income,\" Andrew Yang told CBS News in a phone interview on Friday. \"And New York is also the most densely populated city in our country. So if there's any place you would want people to have the ability to stay home, not have to worry about where their next grocery money or rent check is going to come from, it would be in New York, in a place like the Bronx.\"\n\nIn an effort to inspire more awareness and giving online, the fund has also pledged $100,000 in micro-grants of $250 or $500 distributed directly via social media networks \u2013 Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. \"Clearly, if your neighbor is struggling, you should help them. But the truth is that some people will be on social media an awful lot because we're all trapped at home,\" Yang conceded. \"And so if you can find a way for someone to be engaged that's actually productive via social media, either to get help or give help, that struck us as very positive.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Friday for bipartisan agreement on the mounting stimulus package that could push $1 trillion and include direct payments to U.S. households reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nYang tweeted Tuesday that his team \"has been in touch with the White House\" and is offering up further resources. The former presidential candidate says while he's thrilled \"common sense is prevailing,\" there will be no victory lap. Yang has encouraged lawmakers to think beyond one-time payments to families hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. \"To me, we don't know how long this crisis is going to continue. You want people to have confidence that their family is going to be okay, even if this crisis drags on for a while,\" Yang told CBS News. \"So instead of one check you should be looking at regular checks once a month or even more frequent, so that we have our basic needs met, even if this does drag on for quite some time.\"\n\nDespite dropping out of the race, Yang \u2013 who endorsed Joe Biden earlier this month \u2014 predicts monthly payments to American families will be \"a major topic\" in the upcoming presidential election and legislative sessions. \"I think both parties are going to be embracing it to a much higher degree. And I believe it's going to end up passing here in the United States in the next number of months,\" he said.\n\nHunkered down in his own home in New York, Yang expresses remorse in hearing the personal stories of former campaign staff, friends and neighbors, isolated by quarantine and social distancing. \"I am deeply concerned that this pandemic is going to cut us off from each other at a time when what we need is actually the ability to help each other,\" Yang said. \"And certainly I'm doing everything I can to help by sending money digitally, but that is not what most people need. Most people need things in person and face to face. That's the way we're wired as people. And so I think it's very hard to see a silver lining in this crisis.\"\n\nAlan He contributed to this report.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":118,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/20\/21187671\/nasa-space-launch-system-rocket-development-testing-shutdown-coronavirus","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-03-20","author":"['Loren Grush']","title":"NASA is suspending development of its future deep-space rocket during coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/NTYzBvZGTJuBjTuoBzgH6icyhV0=\/0x399:5568x3314\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19820618\/MAF_20200108_Artemis_Roll_out_DN_567_orig.jpg","body_text":"NASA is shutting down production and testing of its future deep-space rocket and crew capsule in response to the worsening coronavirus pandemic. The two vehicles are critical pieces of NASA\u2019s ambitious plan to return humans to the Moon by 2024, but with development temporarily suspended, meeting that deadline will become even more unlikely.\n\nThe shutdown comes amid NASA\u2019s decision to heighten restrictions at two of the agency\u2019s centers. The Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi are both moving to Stage 4 within NASA\u2019s \u201cResponse Framework\u201d for dealing with the pandemic, which is the strictest stage. That means telework is absolutely mandatory and all travel is suspended. The change was made after an employee at Stennis tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a blog post by NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. No one at Michoud has tested positive for the virus yet, but there is a rising number of cases near the center.\n\nMichoud and Stennis are both moving to Stage 4\n\nBoth centers play critical roles in the development of NASA\u2019s next big rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS. Cores of the rocket are primarily built at Michoud by NASA personnel and employees of Boeing, the vehicle\u2019s main contractor. Meanwhile, the first completed core of the SLS is currently at Stennis, where it\u2019s scheduled to undergo a significant ground test later this year. Called the Green Run Test, the exercise will ignite all of the engines on the rocket while it\u2019s held down, simulating a launch without actually going to space. The test is meant to pave the way for the inaugural launch of the SLS, which is currently slated for 2021.\n\nNow, with both centers restricting access, the production of new SLS cores and the work needed to prepare for the Green Run Test is coming to a halt. \u201cThe NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,\u201d Bridenstine wrote in his update. \u201cOnce this is complete, personnel allowed onsite will be limited to those needed to protect life and critical infrastructure.\u201d NASA is reassessing which personnel will be considered \u201cmission critical\u201d and allowed on site at each facility.\n\nThe shutdown is another blow for the SLS program, which suffered from delays and cost overruns long before the pandemic began. Originally slated for launch in 2017, the rocket\u2019s first flight won\u2019t happen until late next year at the earliest, and its first flight with crew on board is currently planned for either 2022 or 2023. The program\u2019s budget has ballooned over the last decade as well, with the total development cost expected to reach $18.3 billion by the time rocket flies, according to a recent report from NASA\u2019s Inspector General.\n\nDespite all this trouble, the SLS is a key part of NASA\u2019s Artemis program to land the first woman on the Moon. The vehicle\u2019s third flight is meant to carry astronauts on that historic mission to the lunar surface. Given the 2024 deadline set by the Trump administration, there was already very little wiggle room with the current SLS schedule to meet that timeframe. A shutdown like this puts that goal in jeopardy \u2014 something NASA acknowledges.\n\n\u201cWe realize there will be impacts to NASA missions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe realize there will be impacts to NASA missions, but as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the NASA workforce,\u201d Bridenstine wrote.\n\nThe other critical piece of hardware needed for the Artemis program is the Orion crew capsule, which the astronauts will ride inside when launching on top of the SLS. The Orion capsule that will fly on the debut flight of the SLS just underwent testing in Ohio and is about to travel to Cape Canaveral, Florida, ahead of the launch next year. It now seems that once Orion makes it to Florida, work on that vehicle will shut down temporarily. Meanwhile, work on future Orion crew capsules will stop at Michoud.\n\nWith this latest move, three of NASA\u2019s centers are at Stage 4, along with Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. The rest are at Stage 3, which allows mission-essential personnel to access NASA centers and travel. As the novel coronavirus situation worsens, it likely won\u2019t be long until all of the centers move to Stage 4. It\u2019s unclear how that will impact the rest of NASA\u2019s activities, such as launches out of Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston maintains that its flight controllers can continue to operate the International Space Station even at Stage 4.\n\n\u201cI will continue to say, so none of us forget \u2013 there is no team better prepared for doing hard things,\u201d Bridenstine wrote in his post. \u201cTake care of yourself, your family, and your NASA team.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":120,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/21\/21189184\/gm-ventec-ventilators-tesla-musk-coronavirus","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-03-21","author":"['Kim Lyons']","title":"GM is partnering with Ventec Life Systems to help increase production of ventilators","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/_4I4Ak4Fe33a3XiHF8qIIU73w4g=\/0x299:3000x1870\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19823124\/692961544.jpg.jpg","body_text":"General Motors is partnering with Ventec Life Systems to help increase production of ventilators that are needed in hospitals dealing with patients who have the novel coronavirus, the companies announced Friday.

Meanwhile, the institutions also find themselves needing to pay higher prices for personal protective equipment such as face masks and other gear that's in short supply. Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals nationwide Wednesday to delay elective surgeries to free up capacity and resources for future coronavirus patients.\n\nThe American Hospital Association responded Thursday by asking Congress for $100 billion for all hospitals to offset coronavirus costs, citing rural hospitals' inability to withstand huge losses for long.\n\n\"If we're not able to address the short-term cash needs of rural hospitals, we're going to see hundreds of rural hospitals close before this crisis ends,\" warned Alan Morgan, the head of the National Rural Health Association, which represents 21,000 health care providers and hospitals. \"This is not hyperbole.\"\n\nWell before the COVID-19 threat, rural health care's profitability had collapsed nationwide due to a combination of narrowing Medicare reimbursements, a larger share of patients lacking high-paying private insurance and the hollowing out of rural America. Given such pressures, more than 120 rural hospitals have been forced to close over the past decade.\n\nThose hospitals in small-town America that have survived rely heavily on moneymakers such as elective surgeries, physical therapy and lab tests to make their razor-thin margins work. But, according to the Chicago-based Chartis Center for Rural Health, almost half of them still operate in the red.\n\nSo the added financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak could be the final straw for many rural hospitals \u2014 exposing the complicated business dynamics at play within the United States' critical public health infrastructure.\n\n\"This virus, and what it is causing for these hospitals, is the perfect storm that will close these hospitals at a time this country critically needs them,\" says Robin Rau, CEO of Miller County Hospital in southwestern Georgia. \"This is going to be the death blow to them.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, she started eliminating all medical services that were not urgent. She estimates that has cut off at least half of the hospital's revenue. Other CEOs warned similar cuts at their hospitals mean they won't make payroll in the coming weeks.\n\nThe National Rural Health Association, along with many rural hospital executives, is lobbying for immediate cash assistance, no-interest loans, Medicare reimbursement adjustments and other suggestions to alleviate the pain. The association favors a bailout plan from Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., which in early drafts called for the equivalent of a three-month advance based on hospitals' previous patient numbers, according to Bennet's office.\n\n\"Rural hospitals have already been closing their doors at startling rates, and this crisis will only exacerbate that fact,\" Bennet tells KHN in a written statement. \"There is an incredible opportunity for rural hospitals to shoulder some of the burdens of caring for patients and helping to meet possible bed shortages.\"\n\nStill, many rural hospital CEOs worry any assistance may come too late.\n\n\"And yet I hear they're going to bail out the cruise lines? Really?\" Missouri's Scotland County Hospital CEO Dr. Randy Tobler says.\n\nAs Tobler looks at his older, sicker, underinsured patient population, he says he is afraid the hospital, located on the state's northeastern rural border, might last only until May before running out of money for payroll.\n\n\"In the truly safety-net areas, we're being called to high duty,\" he says. \"And we're running on fumes.\"\n\nMichael Purvis, CEO of Candler County Hospital in Metter, Ga., says he's already fallen into a negative cash flow situation in the past week. The number of patients coming to his hospital, which is about 65 miles outside Savannah, for profitable outpatient procedures has dropped by half as people in droves have canceled their surgeries, MRIs and physical therapy. Purvis has implemented fever checks of people at the entrance. But he remains fearful that his billing staff could be forced to quarantine themselves if they fall ill \u2014 effectively shutting off the hospital's revenue.\n\n\"If my billers and coders stay healthy, I can make it to April, maybe end of June,\" Purvis says.\n\nOn top of the massive loss of revenue, Julie Jones, CEO at Community Hospital-Fairfax in northwestern Missouri, says she can only get specialty N95 respirator masks that offer critical protection for her front-line providers for about $5 each \u2014 more than 16 times the normal cost of 30 cents.\n\nAngela Ammons, CEO of Clinch Memorial Hospital in Homerville, Ga., says she has warned staff that if hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes continue to go missing, she'll watch the video footage and fire on the spot anyone caught stealing supplies. And she is so worried about running out of protective equipment, she's asking any of her \"crafty\" staff with sewing machines to sew cotton masks.\n\n\"I would rather staff go in with a fabric mask than no mask at all,\" she says.\n\nTo be sure, rural hospitals are not as equipped as larger hospital systems to handle the most serious coronavirus cases. Many are not outfitted with ICUs or enough doctors and staff to handle multiple intensive care patients. That means they have to transfer those patients to larger hospitals.\n\nStill, rural experts argue that their bed and health care capacity can be leveraged to keep potential coronavirus cases out of the major hospitals. Plus, rural facilities could be places for initial triage or eventual recovery care.\n\nAnd if nothing changes, Rau worries, the country is about to lose this critical public health infrastructure.\n\n\"We can talk all we want about the cost of health care in this country in this ridiculous health care system we have,\" she says. \"But at a time like this, who for a minute would think about getting rid of rural hospitals?\"\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Compassion!, Master Class and Ragtime won him a string of Tonys in the 1990s. He also won a lifetime achievement Tony last year. In all, McNally's body of work encompassed some four dozen plays and musicals, many of which went to Broadway.\n\nMcNally was born Nov. 3, 1938 in St. Petersburg, Fla., and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, before attending Columbia University in New York. (In a 2002 interview with the school, he professed not to know how he had graduated, saying: \"I went to the theater so much.\")\n\nMcNally was a crucial voice in illuminating the lives of LGBT people in the United States; in 1995, the New York Times marveled that his \"proudly gay play\" Love! Valor! Compassion! became a mainstream Broadway hit.\n\nIn a 2019 interview, he told Playbill he was \"tone-deaf,\" but that he also considered himself to be a musical person. Certainly, much of his stage work \u2014 whether writing books for musicals or, in the case of Master Class, creating a theatrical portrait of opera legend Maria Callas \u2014 was an expression of his deep love of music.

His \u201cThe Visit\u201d was a meditation on revenge.\n\nMany of his works were also presented on Chicago\u2019s theater stages.\n\n\u201cTerrence McNally was a ground-breaking playwright who broke new ground with plays such as \u2018The Ritz,\u2019 \u2018Kiss of the Spider Woman\u2019 and \u201cLips Together, Teeth Apart, that dealt with issues in the gay community in a way few other playwrights had managed to do at that time. At the same time, he was able to create works such as the script to \u201cRagtime\u201d that covered the entire panoply of an historic era. His energy and creativity will be missed, but his five decades of writing have left the world of theater a forever better place,\u201d said First Folio artistic director David Rice.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to his husband Tom at this impossible moment. Terrence was writing about being gay and the AIDS crisis at a moment in time when we desperately needed the authenticity of his voice and he opened a door for us in the hearts of audiences everywhere. We owe him an enormous debt of gratitude,\u201d said Writers Theatre artistic director Michael Halberstam.\n\n\u201cTerrence McNally\u2019s untimely passing has robbed the American theater of one of its most passionate and productive artists \u2014 and, for those of us who had the pleasure of working with and knowing him, a true friend and mentor,\u201d said Goodman Theater artistic associate Steve Scott, who worked with McNally on the Chicago company\u2019s world premiere of \u201cThe Visit\u201d and various other projects. \u201cTerrence was equally at home in the worlds of stage drama, comedy, musical theater and opera ... but his most notable (and heartfelt) accomplishment was a series of plays which gave voice to the gay community and its members, chronicling its emergence from the shadows in the 1970s, encapsulating the tragedies and triumphs of the AIDS pandemic, and leading the way to 21st century social revolution and acceptance.\u201d\n\nMcNally was born in St. Petersburg, Florida, and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, listening to radio broadcasts of \u201cThe Green Hornet\u201d and the Metropolitan Opera. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in 1960 with a degree in English.\n\nMcNally was at the Actors Studio when he was hired by novelist John Steinbeck to be a tutor and guardian to his sons. One of McNally\u2019s earliest theater attempts was writing the book for a musical adaptation of Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cEast of Eden\u201d which was called \u201cHere\u2019s Where I Belong\u201d and lasted only a single performance on Broadway in 1968.\n\nMcNally\u2019s first Broadway play \u201cAnd Things That Go Bump in the Night\u201d didn\u2019t fare much better in 1965. His absurdist, symbolic melodrama about good and evil confounded critics. Newsday called it \u201cugly, perverted, tasteless.\u201d It closed in less than three weeks. He was 24.\n\nHe rebounded with the 1969 off-Broadway hit \u201cNext,\u201d a two-character comedy about a reluctant draftee reporting for an Army physical. A string of successes followed, including \u201cWhere Has Tommy Flowers Gone?\u201d (1971), \u201cThe Tubs\u201d (1974), \u201cBad Habits\u201d (1974) and \u201cThe Ritz\u201d (1975), a farce set in a gay bathhouse that ran more than a year on Broadway and became McNally\u2019s first produced screenplay.\n\nHis breakout, \u201cFrankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,\u201d about a romance between a waitress and short order cook, was later adapted into a film starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. It was revived on Broadway in 2019 starring Audra McDonald. Chicago\u2019s Steppenwolf Theatre company staged a critically acclaimed version in 2004, starring Laurie Metcalf and Yasen Peyankov.\n\nHe collaborated three times with legendary composer John Kander and lyricist Freb Ebb \u2014 on \u201cThe Rink,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cThe Visit.\u201d Chita Rivera starred in all three.\n\nHis love of opera informed his works \u201cGolden Age,\u201d \u201cThe Lisbon Traviata\u201d and \u201cMaster Class,\u201d which explored the life of opera diva Maria Callas. He also contributed to opera as a librettist \u2014 \u201cThe Food of Love\u201d in 1999 with music by Robert Beaser, \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d in 2000 with music by Jake Heggie, and 2015\u2019s \u201cGreat Scott\u201d with Heggie.\n\nMcNally sometimes was controversial, especially with his play \u201cCorpus Christi,\u201d which depicts a modern-day Jesus as a homosexual. The Manhattan Theater Club, the first company to consider staging it, received death threats and temporarily canceled the production before enjoying a successful run.\n\nWhen picking up his \u201cRagtime\u201d Tony Award, McNally thanked the theater community for its outcry. \u201cYou came together when I was in trouble. It was a time of oppression. You came together overnight. Our voices were heard, and we won.\u201d Holding his Tony high, he said, \u201cSo this is for freedom. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrence McNally has been and will always be a beacon in our theater and the LGBTQIA+ communities,\u201d said Chay Yew, artistic director of Chicago\u2019s Victory Gardens Theater. \u201cHis body of work has shone an immense light on our lives, allowing us and others to see ourselves, with humor, with heart, with humanity, especially when we needed it most during the AIDS epidemic. I know I did. He will always live on in many of artists and people he has inspired.\u201d\n\nMcNally and his partner, Thomas Kirdahy, married in Vermont in 2003, and again in Washington, D.C., in 2010.\n\nContributing: Sun-Times reporter Miriam Di Nunzio","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":164,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/26\/822224393\/show-me-the-relief-money-no-promises-on-when-coronavirus-checks-are-coming","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-03-26","author":"['Vanessa Romo']","title":"Show Me The Relief Money \u2013 No Promises On When Coronavirus Checks Are Coming","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/03\/26\/gettyimages-1208076292_wide-e341b7dd6c0a1066935a58919b9c96e036900a07.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Show Me The Relief Money \u2013 No Promises On When Coronavirus Checks Are Coming\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Xinhua News Agency\/Getty Images Xinhua News Agency\/Getty Images\n\nThe $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package marks the largest rescue package in American history. President Trump announced Wednesday that it includes $300 billion in direct payments to individuals to alleviate at least a little of the financial pain caused by the deliberate near-standstill of the U.S. economy.\n\nBut despite promises that the one-time funds will be distributed \"within the next three weeks,\" it will likely be months before the stimulus checks hit bank accounts according to experts.\n\nUnder the plan, single people earning incomes below $75,000 will receive as much as $1,200 as \"direct payments into most people's deposit accounts,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a news briefing on Wednesday.\n\nMarried couples would get $2,400, and parents would receive $500 for each child under age 17. About 90% of households \u2014 approximately 165 million \u2014 would benefit from the checks, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nPayments would be phased out beyond those income limits, and people making more than $99,000 will not be eligible at all.\n\nHow soon can I expect my check?\n\n\"It really depends on what information the IRS has on you,\" Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told NPR.\n\nThat's because the infusion of cash will be distributed by the IRS, so those who have previously received tax refunds via direct deposit will be first in line for the rebate checks. Pomerleau, estimates the earliest those payments will go out is three to four weeks after the package is approved.\n\nAlternatively, people who receive tax refunds through the mail will have to hold out much longer.\n\n\"I don't think physical checks will be in the mail for another three to four months,\" Pomerleau said, citing delays in the system in 2008 when the government last issued national stimulus payments under the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBack then the financial relief package was signed into law in February but the delivery date for people whose checks were sent through the mail was somewhere between May and July.\n\nThere's another group who may have an even longer wait: Those who receive tax refunds in the mail and have moved since filing 2018 taxes.\n\n\"So far there's no information on how [the IRS is] going to handle that,\" he said.\n\nWhat if I didn't file 2018 taxes?\n\nPomerleau says nonfilers, including recent college graduates, and those who didn't file 2018 taxes because they had no obligation, \"would be left out unless they hurry up and file a return for 2019.\"\n\nAmericans receiving Social Security benefits are also on file with the government and their payments will be based on those records, he added.\n\nWhat if I made more than $99,000 in 2018 or 2019?\n\nThose who earned more than $99,000 are not totally shut out from the massive relief package if they expect to make less than that sum in the coming year.\n\nThe IRS will allow tax filers to qualify for the relief aid next year, when filing 2020 taxes.\n\n\"That of course is no good for someone who needs to pay their bills today,\" Pomerleau said, \"but all is not lost.\"\n\nOther holdups\n\nJanet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, suspects the IRS's infrastructure, or lack thereof, will create even more delays for desperate people.\n\nIn the past it has taken several months for the government to develop, test and install the kind of software necessary to launch a rebate program. But it is unclear, what if anything, the administration has done behind the scenes so far.\n\n\"It takes several months to get a program like this up and moving,\" Holtzblatt told NPR.\n\n\"I hope that they've been building their infrastructure in the days between when they first announced they were going to do this and the day of enactment,\" she said, adding that in 2008, the process took at least three months.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on the IRS\n\nAnother unknown factor, that Holtzblatt says needs to be considered is how the COVID-19 disease is going to affect the capacity of the IRS staff to ensure the timely delivery of the payments.\n\nAs she noted in a recent blog post:\n\nAll of that may slow distribution of the payments, Holtzblatt said.\n\nShe cautioned the public to be patient: \"The IRS will be overburdened and there will be lots of taxpayer confusion ... and all this will collide with the processing of 2019 returns.

It\u2019s just that simple,\u201d Sandra said.\n\nHector and Sandra are pushing 50 and have lived in Chicago for nearly 20 years. Both of them work at a warehouse packaging Windex, Clorox disinfecting wipes and other cleaning supplies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really busy right now,\u201d Sandra said.\n\nOn March 11, the day the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic over the coronavirus, a worker near Sandra on the crowded warehouse assembly line started coughing.\n\n\u201cThat worried me,\u201d Sandra said. The rheumatoid arthritis weakens her immune system, she said, \u201cand I already know to stay away from people who feel sick.\u201d\n\nFearing the worst, she called off work the next week, but her husband still clocked in. The couple makes about $800 a week after taxes, just enough to cover the basics, including the $1,200 monthly rent for the two-bedroom apartment they share with their 13-year-old son.\n\n\u201cWe both have to work to make it,\u201d Sandra said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my health, but what can I do?\u201d\n\n(The Sun-Times agreed not to use the last names of undocumented people quoted in this story.)\n\nOne day without work becomes a crisis\n\nThere are around 400,000 undocumented immigrants in Illinois. None of them can claim unemployment insurance even if, like Hector and Sandra, they\u2019ve paid into the system for years.\n\nTax-paying undocumented immigrants were also excluded from receiving $1,200 checks from the federal government in the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress on Friday. Those checks are reserved for qualified workers with Social Security numbers.\n\nNearly half of undocumented are uninsured, according to a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care think-tank. That means there\u2019s a high chance many of them who feel sick are still going to work, said Jorge Mujica, an immigrant and labor rights organizer with Arise Chicago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real safety net for undocumented immigrants, not even during a pandemic,\u201d Mujica said. \u201cMost undocumented immigrants don\u2019t have paid time off or sick leave.

I want to work, and now I can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried that much about the virus. I always took care of myself and bought disinfectant and cleaning supplies. I taught my kids how to wash their hands all the time. But not having a job makes it a lot harder not to panic.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m their safety net right now\u2019\n\nAs undocumented immigrants feel the pinch, their children are stepping up to keep their households afloat.\n\nMartha Diaz is one of an estimated 35,000 young people in Illinois who have temporary legal status through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Despite the relatively low death toll numbers, Ebola has resulted in very high mortality rates in recent decades.\n\nIn June 1976 an unknown disease started killing people in Sudan. 151 out of 284 patients lost their lives to an illness, which at first looked like common flu. Its main symptoms included fever, sore throat, muscular pain, headache, and fatigue.\n\nBut within days the disease progressed, with patients starting to suffer from vomiting, combined with internal and external bleeding.\n\nThe agent that caused the illness was named \"Sudan virus\" and later became part of the larger Ebola virus family.\n\nJust like many similar infectious diseases, Ebola is zoonotic in nature, meaning that it jumped from animals to humans. Its potential carriers include fruit bats \u2013 a large bat species, which are also called \u201cflying foxes\u201d, as well as several monkey species, gorillas and baboons.\n\nAlmost 20 years after the Sudan epidemic, Ebola re-surfaced in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with hundreds of people falling victim to the outbreaks.\n\nHollywood dedicated several movies to Ebola-style epidemics, with 1995\u2019s \u201cOutbreak\u201d starring Morgan Freeman and Dustin Hoffman probably the most notable. In the film, US military virologists are struggling to contain Matoba \u2013 a virus that has jumped from monkeys to humans and largely resembles Ebola.\n\nBut there are also major differences between the two. According to the \u201cOutbreak\u201d screenplay, Matoba, which spreads lightning-fast through a California town, is airborne, while Ebola can only be transferred from one person to another only through liquids, such as blood, saliva and sweat:\n\nWe got 19 dead, we got 100 more infected. It\u2019s spreading like a brushfire. - What are you talking about? - If one of them has got it, then 10 of them got it now, and if one of them gets on to Cedar Creek, then we\u2019ve got a very interesting problem!\n\nHollywood\u2019s fictional Ebola strain also has something in common with the COVID19 pandemic - namely that it is highly contagious due to its transmission from person to person through the air.\n\nThe good news is that the world is unlikely to be overwhelmed by Ebola since the disease has never made it outside of Africa. So far, the current outbreak mainly affects the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease has claimed more than 1,300 lives within the past three years.\n\nBy contrast, Covid-19 has already spread across most countries around the world, causing border closures, flight cancellations and economic losses, which may lead to an economic crisis of unprecedented scale.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is the mortality rate. While the Ebola virus kills between 25% and 90% of its carriers, according to the World Health Organization, by March 2020 the coronavirus had an average mortality rate of just 3.4 percent.\n\nEven though no safe and effective Ebola treatment has yet been found, it seems that victory over the deadly jungle virus is near. In August 2019, Nature magazine described two experimental drugs produced by a US pharmaceutical company as being helpful in achieving 90% survival rates among Ebola patients. If these two drugs receive formal approval, it\u2019s possible that together with the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which was introduced in 2016, they will be able to stop Ebola completely.\n\nWe'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":180,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/cannabis\/2020\/3\/27\/21196472\/marijuana-pot-delivery-illinois-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-03-27","author":"['Tom Schuba']","title":"Legalizing pot deliveries gains momentum during coronavirus crisis","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/ihGmTcmcYAnhLMuCifa-vsyuNnc=\/0x72:880x533\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/16039091\/weed_sales_nevada_e1535506188757.jpg","body_text":"As Illinoisans are ordered to hunker down to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, calls to allow legal marijuana deliveries have increased.\n\nState Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she\u2019s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.\n\nRelated How recreational weed went from illegal to essential in 3 months\n\n\u201cI would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special executive order allowing that, or us being able to get that legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,\u201d said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.\n\nThat landmark piece of legislation didn\u2019t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.\n\nCurbside pickup allowed\n\nHarper\u2019s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state\u2019s more than 100,000 medical users can also have a registered caretaker pick up pot products for them.\n\nHarper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be \u201cmore difficult\u201d than allowing those curbside sales.\n\n\u201cIt would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would also be creating a new type of license.\u201d\n\nPritzker\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.\n\n\u201cThe state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,\u201d the industry insider said.\n\nMargo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.\n\n\u201cI think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,\u201d said Vesely. \u201cMedical patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can\u2019t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don\u2019t have a caretaker, they\u2019re stuck.\n\n\u201cSo it would be really beneficial for them,\u201d she added.\n\nHarper noted that she\u2019s recently seen people waiting to get inside dispensaries and that curbside sales are also attracting lines of cars. As officials institute strict measures to promote social distancing, she said \u201cmobile delivery is probably needed in this time more than ever.\u201d\n\nHowever, Harper said it\u2019s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.\n\n\u201cAs it stands right now, the bill hasn\u2019t even been heard in committee yet,\u201d said Harper. \u201cSo we really haven\u2019t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":183,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/goatsandsoda\/2020\/03\/28\/822717664\/a-reward-of-liquor-for-coronavirus-heroes-in-china-does-not-bring-cheers","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-03-28","author":"['Yuhan Xu']","title":"A Reward Of Liquor For Coronavirus Heroes In China Does Not Bring Cheers","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/03\/27\/gettyimages-1180030589-50_wide-6686388ac6348b811c1dcd0092a962f8c26bb836.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"A Reward Of Liquor For Coronavirus Heroes In China Does Not Bring Cheers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Zhang Peng\/LightRocket via Getty Images Zhang Peng\/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nPan-fried buns with beef filling, shrimp stir-fried with seasonal bamboo shoots, roasted chicken and seared scallops \u2014 such dishes are on the menu for the Shanghai medical staff who recently returned from Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of China's COVID-19 outbreak. To show its gratitude for the 1,649 now-quarantined workers, the city has cooked up a free 14-day meal plan for them.\n\nIn Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province, the city's Federation of Trade Unions is saying \"thank you\" by handing out 2,000 yuan ($280) cash to the families of 122 medics, who will also get paid leave to recuperate after \"winning the battle of epidemic prevention and control.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Guizhou province, residents are wondering: Is a reward still a reward if the heroes have to pay for it?\n\nIn the poverty-stricken province, Guizhou Liquor Exchange, a trading platform that promotes liquor trading, investment and storage, took the appreciation game in a questionable direction. It recently offered each of the 1,443 front-line medical workers back from Hubei the opportunity to buy up to six bottles of the nation's most sought-after liquor \u2014 a locally produced, 106 proof Maotai liquor called Feitian \u2014 at 1,499 yuan ($210) per bottle.\n\nA bottle of Feitian could fetch from 2,000 yuan ($280) to 300,000 yuan ($42,200), depending on the year it was made and market demand.\n\nProduced by the state-owned Kweichow Moutai Group in Guizhou, Maotai liquor is the Chinese answer to premium scotch. Known as China's national liquor, it's often served on official occasions and holiday dinner tables. In 1972, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai made a Maotai toast to then-President Richard Nixon, who was warned prior to the banquet not to drink it. (He did anyway.)\n\nAlthough the Group sold 142,000 tons of liquor worth more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in 2019, it's not enough for those thirsty for Maotai. Fake Maotai liquors are all over the market, retailing at similar price points. Some fans make pilgrimages to Maotai town, where each visitor is allowed to buy two bottles. On the Chinese e-commerce site Tmall, Feitian liquor is available each day, with a limit of two bottles per 180 days. It's snapped up in seconds.\n\nWhile $2,106 for six might be a steal, consider the per capita disposable income of an urban resident in Guizhou: 20,397 yuan ($2,870) in 2019. That's one reason the offer has been derided as a crass publicity stunt.\n\n\"They [Guizhou Liquor Exchange] are shameless,\" said a commenter on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. \"It's just a couple bottles of liquor. Can't they just give for free?\"\n\n\"This is how you treat our heroes?\" another opined.\n\n\"Do you think regular medical workers can afford it?\" one asked.\n\nOthers think it's a good deal, especially given the resale market.\n\n\"Do you not know how expensive Maotai liquor is? Isn't this a reward?\" one netizen asked.\n\n\"I think it's pretty good,\" another said. \"They can make money by reselling these liquors.\"\n\nAs criticism became increasingly heated, the Guizhou government stepped in, asking Guizhou Liquor Exchange to immediately stop using the pandemic for marketing purposes.\n\nThe Exchange has not yet commented.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":185,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/cannabis\/2020\/3\/29\/21198561\/illinois-marijuana-legal-weed-craft-grower-transporter-infuser-license-deadline-extended-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-03-29","author":[],"title":"State extends pot business application deadline amid COVID-19 pandemic","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/BUjzFDrcGAfNwxfVUy8Eu_cMS9Y=\/0x0:1435x751\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19856824\/cannabis_7_e1541194305325.jpg","body_text":"State officials have once again extended the deadline for applications for certain recreational cannabis business licenses amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGov.

There\u2019s a whiff of paranoia in the air.\n\nFor millions of seasonal allergy sufferers, the annual onset of watery eyes and scratchy throats is bumping up against the global spread of a new virus that produces its own constellation of respiratory symptoms.\n\nWith coronavirus restrictions in place, interactions with nature might be limited to a quick walk through the neighborhood, but it\u2019s not hard to notice spring has sprung \u2014 bringing allergy season with it.\n\nAllergy symptoms are likely to increase during the next two to three weeks as pollen counts grow into the thousands, said Leonard Bielory, professor of medicine, allergy, immunology and ophthalmology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the cold snap, we\u2019d be having an incredible amount of pollen right now,\u201d Bielory said Monday. \u201cOnce it warms up, with the rain we\u2019ve gotten, it\u2019s going to be quite an intense opening season for trees. It\u2019s going to explode.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s causing angst for people who never have had to particularly worry about their hay fever, other than to stock up on antihistamines, decongestants and tissues. Now they\u2019re asking: Are these my allergies? Or something more sinister?\n\n\u201cEveryone is sort of analyzing every sneeze and cough right now,\u201d said Kathy Przywara, who manages an online community of allergy sufferers for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.\n\nNever mind the differing symptoms \u2014 that sneezing and runny nose, hallmarks of hay fever, are not typically associated with COVID-19, which commonly produces coughing, fever and in more serious cases shortness of breath. Never mind that allergies don\u2019t cause fevers. Allergy sufferers fret that there\u2019s just enough overlap to make them nervous.\n\nPatients with asthma or allergies who cough and experience breathlessness can resolve their symptoms with inhalers or prescription medication.\n\nBut if a patient has COVID-19, those solutions won\u2019t work.\n\nMany garden-variety hay fever sufferers, of whom there are about 19 million adults in the U.S., are also on heightened alert.\n\nThey\u2019re taking their temperatures each day, just in case. They\u2019re hiding their sneezes and sniffles from suspicious colleagues and grossed-out grocery shoppers. They\u2019re commiserating with each other and sharing memes on social media (\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should buy Zyrtec or turn myself in to the CDC\u201d).\n\nPamela Smelser is reminded of allergy season every time she looks out the window of her home office, where her cherry tree is blooming. Spring came early to Maryland, she said, and lots of people are coughing and sneezing from the pollen.\n\n\u201cYou do what you have to do: You take your meds for allergies and stay away from people,\u201d Smelser said. \u201cPeople get really hinky about coughing right now.\u201d\n\nThough she\u2019s had allergies for years, Smelser, a semi-retired social worker and community college teacher outside Baltimore, admits to being a touch paranoid. She takes her temperature every day because she\u2019s 66 and, well, you can never be too careful.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t rule out that I have anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the paranoia: You can\u2019t even get a test to say, \u2018This is all seasonal allergies.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania, pear trees are budding, red maple are beginning to flower and Leslie Haerer\u2019s allergies are already in full bloom. The 64-year-old retired nurse, who lives about an hour north of Philadelphia, is coping with a scratchy throat, an urge to sneeze and a headache behind the eyes.\n\nAs a medical professional, Haerer knows her symptoms are attributable to her allergies. She also knows that other people are \u201creally flipped out about this,\u201d including the scowling family of three who saw her sneeze into her elbow outside a Chinese restaurant and, instead of continuing on to their destination \u2014 the pizza shop next door \u2014 got in their car and sped away.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry you missed your pizza,\u2019\u201d Haerer said. \u201cPeople\u2019s reactions are just over the top.\u201d\n\nIn Austin, Texas, where pollen counts are high, Marty Watson initially dismissed his itchy eyes, mild headache, coughing and sneezing as the product of a tree allergy, even after his temperature became slightly elevated. Then, in mid-March, he realized he could no longer smell a pungent sourdough starter, and friends began sending him news stories that said a loss of smell sometimes accompanied a coronavirus infection.\n\n\u201dAustin is notorious for all sorts of allergies, and it became really hard to tell: Is it this? Is it that?\u201d said Watson, 52.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nAs allergy season ramps up in Pennsylvania, Dr. Laura Fisher, an allergist in Lancaster, expects an influx of worried patients. She is advising them to keep up with their medications, stay at home as much as possible and monitor for symptoms that seem unrelated to their allergies.\n\n\u201cI think people are more afraid of catching it, more afraid of going out and getting it from the grocery store or drive-thru, than they are of their usual symptoms being COVID,\u201d said Fisher, president of the Pennsylvania Allergy and Asthma Association.\n\nJessica Tanniehill initially blew off her symptoms as allergy-related.\n\nTanniehill, 39, of Adamsville, Alabama, started with a runny nose and sneezing. Body aches and a cough came next, following by shortness of breath. She thought her seasonal allergies had led to a bout of anxiety, nothing more, especially since she\u2019d been outside all day doing yard work and washing her truck. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d she said.\n\nTurns out she\u2019d contracted COVID-19 \u2014 which doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that she\u2019d had allergies as well.\n\nTanniehill, who\u2019s now on the mend, acknowledged that she \u201cwas one of the people that was saying they\u2019re overreacting to all this. But now I wish I was more careful.\u201d\n\nContributing: USA Today","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":193,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/2020\/03\/30\/share-your-coronavirus-story\/5092528002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-03-30","author":[],"title":"Share your coronavirus story","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/03\/31\/USAT\/18504f7d-3070-4191-b12c-bcfbbc0e6119-AP_US_Virus_Outbreak_Iowa.JPG?crop=3543,1993,x0,y182&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"USA TODAY\n\nShare your story, experiences and messages for front-line workers and others throughout the nation on USA TODAY Opinion's coronavirus hotline.

Students could have a \u201cHey Day\u201d and graduation inside Minecraft, just as a Japanese elementary school had organized days earlier.\n\nQuickly, \u201cPenncraft\u201d students began to recreate dormitories, food trucks, and local sculptures in-game. Makarios Chung, an early builder, measured buildings\u2019 dimensions and streets positions constantly to ensure their scale was as accurate as possible. The first day of building, students took an hour to decide the placement of one street. Their main goal was to have a completed campus, specifically Locust Street, for graduating seniors to walk down in-game now that COVID-19 ensured they wouldn\u2019t return to campus and complete this UPenn tradition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first in my family to graduate from college so it wasn\u2019t just my commencement, it was for the rest of my family too,\u201d senior Nyazia Sajdah-Bey says. She left campus suddenly, and is now helping rebuild it in Minecraft, days after departure. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the chance to properly mourn or, finish out my senior bucket list, say goodbye to my friends and teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to process that loss. So it\u2019s really sweet working on the campus. It\u2019s making the process of leaving feel less sudden and more gradual.\u201d Guo, Chung, and Sajdah-Bey are a few of the hundreds of college students on similar paths of departing and virtually rebuilding.\n\nStudents from Boston University to UCLA, from South Louisiana Community College to Northwestern University, have recently created or resurrected Minecraft servers and shared their creations on Discord chats, in Facebook meme groups, and on Reddit threads. The boom of college Minecraft servers has begun. These servers have the express purpose of bringing students together and building, oftentimes focused on recreating their college campuses. Searches for Minecraft server hosting have peaked to unprecedented levels in the last few weeks, and thousands of students are discussing college servers, most notably on the Facebook group \u201cZoom Memes for Self Quaranteens.\u201d Smaller groups and clubs, like Bowdoin College\u2019s men\u2019s ultimate frisbee team or University of La Verne\u2019s debate team, have found ways to bond in survival mode servers after their practices and championships were canceled. Zoom isn\u2019t nearly enough, and it doesn\u2019t carry the ten years of memories that Gen Z has for Minecraft.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to see campus as I remember it.\u201d\n\nAn overwhelming number of colleges recently closed their campuses and moved to online courses, which felt like a painful shock to students, especially seniors, who expected to have months more time on campus. I was gutted when I had to pack away my Oberlin College dorm room and drive homeward over a weekend. As I entered self-quarantine, I created an Oberlin server for Minecraft, a game I\u2019ve had for a decade and one that has catalyzed dozens of relationships with people I\u2019ve never met in real life. Our server is small, but I\u2019m able to spend time building a home with my partner and adventuring with seniors that I never said goodbye to. Minecraft has become a salve for many students like myself, and college servers have started to become a place where students can log in to process the sudden loss of an on-campus community \u2014 or maybe rebuild it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to really see campus alive again. I can go to the buildings, I can go to the space, I can go to the actual square, the plot, but I\u2019m not going to see campus as I remember it,\u201d Jay Gibbs, a University of Chicago senior, says. \u201cSo from my point of view, it\u2019s basically gone at this point.\u201d Although Minecraft does allow for building 1:1 scale replicas of campuses, just as importantly it allows students to fill campus spaces and interact with each other. After the Penn Relays \u2014 the oldest track and field competition in the United States \u2014 was canceled for the first time in 125 years, Penncraft started to work with the competition\u2019s staff to host a virtual \u201cspeedrunning\u201d version of the Relays in Minecraft. Once each college has a completed in-game campus in the coming weeks, it will be easier to host events; Brown and Columbia are discussing intramural Minecraft Hunger Games.\n\nEven without formal organization, students have come together in college servers in curious ways. In the Oberlin College server I created, I returned one day to find an impromptu food cooperative, a throwback to the famous and culturally significant Oberlin Student Cooperative Association that feeds a fourth of the student body with meals cooked by their peers. This Minecraft version mostly consisted of a chest filled with inedible seeds and raw chicken. On the University of Minnesota server, two students played spikeball on the campus green, tossing a sunflower to each other. In the University of Texas server, students held an in-game birthday party at the top of the famous UT Tower where they set off fireworks and ate cake.\n\nCome May there will be in-game graduations. Inspired by the aforementioned Japanese elementary school, Boston University seniors Rudy Raveendran and Warren Partridge created \u201cQuaranteen University.\u201d This is a new server specifically made to host a Class of 2020 graduation for students from hundreds of different universities. 706 students from 278 institutions have signed up in the last week, and one mom has already emailed Raveendran asking how she can get an in-game seat to this massive ceremony on May 22nd.\n\nThe boom of servers has inspired others to quickly organize around them, like Jasper Ty, a Drexel University freshman, who recently recorded and uploaded a Zoom presentation where he ranks the top five college campus builds. \u201cI have heard people call me a college Minecraft server connoisseur,\u201d he says. Spurred by friends, he is considering starting a series of guided tour videos through Minecraft campuses.\n\nNearly all builders say that they will leave their projects with a newfound appreciation for campus architecture, especially the spots they never visited or overlooked. \u201cIt makes me feel like I took this for granted,\u201d Jan Rubio, a UT freshman, says. \u201cEspecially knowing that people have toiled to recreate these views and these buildings,\u201d adds Jasper Ty.\n\nIt\u2019s true that people have toiled, especially inside the BU build. Last week, Will Pine, a BU junior, journeyed through the deserted BU campus snapping reference photos for the building team, making special note to capture emergency evacuation maps on each floor of the engineering building: they double as well-measured blueprints. On other build Discords, students shared floor plan PDFs that fill in their blindspots for reference photos or memory. Builders can get caught up in small details; a pair of Girl Scouts selling cookies at a crosswalk in the University of Minnesota, or Domino the Cat lounging outside the UT student union building. University of Washington builders went as far as creating a \u201cBuilding Standards\u201d channel on Discord to formalize road widths, the variety of wood for signs, and the color of concrete blocks used in brutalist constructions.\n\nI won\u2019t be walking through Oberlin College\u2019s Wilder Bowl or Terrell Library anytime soon, and my memory will inevitably erase details of the spaces I spent years in. A campus build server could be a mind palace for me, as it has been for others. \u201cThere have been some parts of [the Penncraft] campus where I can stand there and I can feel like I\u2019m standing in the same place in real life, or at least I get the same brainwaves,\u201d Makarios Chung says, remembering a particular frozen courtyard puddle that he slid around on one day. In a moment of new and tragic memories, many students are searching for familiarity. That courtyard is now constructed in the server.\n\nThe server boom can be measured. Mitch Smith, the managing director of Minecraft server hosting service Shockbyte, has seen demand for Minecraft servers spike five times higher than their normal daily orders, starting on March 12th (the day after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic). Beyond providing servers to colleges, Smith said in an email that the company\u2019s Shockbyte for Education program has begun hosting servers for \u201cscout groups, kindergartens, homeschooling parents, daycares, and summer camps.\u201d But the graduating class of 2020 have a unique relationship to the game. We grew up with Minecraft updates from middle school to today, the game getting more complex as we aged. Most interviewed students purchased Minecraft during early alpha development, and returning to it now, in their childhood bedrooms, is like returning to an old toy \u2014 one with no real endgame.\n\n\u201cI have heard people call me a college Minecraft server connoisseur.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have an indefinite bit of free time that might end whenever, I would want something I could just play and stop playing whenever I want,\u201d Jay Gibbs says, speaking about why students are flocking to Minecraft during indefinite self-isolation. Years from now, the spires and statues of Quaranteen U might still stand tall. Students might be playing capture the flag in the Frankensteined mix of campuses below. But these servers aren\u2019t collegiate graveyards; they are small wonders currently under construction.\n\nThe Berklee School of Music campus build is constructed on a strange lie: some blocks that players see are actually disguised sand. In Minecraft, players can construct a few half-block slabs, but Berklee E-Sports Club President Marc Yu wanted their campus to have slabs of terracotta, glass, and other materials that Minecraft didn\u2019t offer. To get around this, the Berklee builders created dozens of \u201cfalling sand\u201d entities in-game that they could re-skin as building materials. Many details of the Berklee build are, technically speaking, a series of sandcastles that are falling apart and being reconstituted almost imperceptibly quickly thanks to the ingenuity of students. Builders like Yu have created an anti-Ozymandias, as their sandcastles will live on as long as the server chugs forward.\n\nFor me, there have been many times when Minecraft has been more reliable than Oberlin College. I hope that won\u2019t be the case for graduation. When the world becomes safer, I want to travel back to the town and campus that has meant so much to me and hold commencement in-person. But this May, I might walk across a blocky stage in Quaranteen U to receive my Oberlin diploma. According to the sign-ups, my avatar will be standing beside nursing school seniors, business school seniors, seniors from my hometown college, as well as Canadian and Turkish universities. When I walk across the stage, I will be proud to be with the Class of 2020 in whatever strange and ragtag form that takes.\n\nUpdate March 31st, 12:50PM ET: This article originally misspelled the names of Makarios Chung and Warren Partridge.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":204,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/speak-your-doctor-about-your-drugs-may-increase-risk-sars-cov-2-covid-19-infection\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-04-01","author":[],"title":"SPEAK WITH YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT YOUR DRUGS THAT MAY INCREASE RISK OF SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) INFECTION","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/ace2.jpg","body_text":"Article courtesy of: Charles B.

It will feature a sportier look, new seats, adaptive cruise control, and a few other minor changes. GM bumped up the range in this past year\u2019s version of the Bolt, from 238 miles to 259 miles, but no further increase is expected in the refresh. A larger SUV-style version of the Bolt announced last month is still on schedule to be released later this year, according to GM.\n\nThe pandemic has already caused the cancellation of some of the world\u2019s biggest car shows and shut down automotive manufacturing plants around the world, including all of the ones in the US. It\u2019s likely to have an impact on the launch of many more new electric vehicles.

Gen. Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers, was in Chicago at McCormick Place, where he\u2019s in charge of putting up a massive field hospital for COVID-19 patients facing a different kind of catastrophe.\n\nTraveling with his staff microbiologist, Semonite, 62, gave elbow bumps to those in the small group greeting him.\n\nHe\u2019s overseeing nine such projects, with many more expected. On Wednesday, he was in Detroit. Then, he flew to Illinois to meet with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a \u201cphenomenal lady,\u201d he said. Thursday morning, he toured McCormick Place before jumping on a small jet to visit another city.\n\nSemonite said he\u2019s prioritizing the Corps\u2019 projects based on the rate of growth of the virus in each city and how many hospital beds are needed.\n\nThe numbers that tell the story: Our coronavirus data tracking On our Coronavirus Data page, you\u2019ll find a collection of graphs, charts and maps tracing the spread of the virus, tracking test results and plotting the impact on individual counties. Check back daily for updated totals.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, though, the single biggest reason why we would come to Chicago or somewhere else is that governor feels that there\u2019s a very, very critical requirement,\u201d Semonite said.\n\nPritzker is \u201cvery, very focused on being able to try to take care of this town,\u201d Semonite said.\n\nNew York was the model for the Corps\u2019 efforts after the Javits convention center was recently converted into a hospital for sick and injured people who aren\u2019t infected with COVID-19. A Navy hospital ship is housing patients sent from Javits.\n\nThe Army Corps is building nine such projects across the country with a total of 9,500 beds, according to Semonite, who said he expects to sign contracts in the next two days for another eight projects with 4,000 more beds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at almost 600 different facilities,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout a week ago, Semonite said he was notified by the secretary of the Army that Pritzker was \u201cvery, very concerned about the bed shortage up here.\u201d\n\nA division commander, Major Gen. Mark Toy, then met with Pritzker, and construction was launched on the McCormick Place\u2019\u201calternative care facility,\u201d which is short of a full-blown hospital.\n\nThree exhibition halls at the convention center are being converted into medical wings, one of which will have 500 beds ready to use Friday, Semonite said.\n\nAnother 2,500 beds will be installed in stages to meet what officials say could be a peak in coronavirus diagnoses in Chicago around mid-April. The buildout is being paid for with $15 million in federal emergency funding.\n\nPeople with varying degrees of coronavirus complications will be housed in each of the three converted exhibition halls.\n\nThe state is in charge of staffing the facility with health-care professionals. Pritzker has said the state is asking for volunteers and hiring people from contracting services. He said enough workers have been hired to staff at least 500 beds.\n\nOfficials have said they also were working to create temporary bed capacity at the shuttered MetroSouth Hospital in Blue Island and the Elgin site where Sherman Hospital was before being demolished.\n\nIn Chicago, United Center is being used for food distribution, first-responder staging and collecting medical supplies.\n\nWalsh Construction is building the infrastructure for the field hospital at Place.\n\nIllinois National Guard troops are assembling the beds and other equipment.\n\nSemonite said the project is based on one of four standard designs for retrofitting big spaces like convention centers, vacant hospitals, dorms and sports arenas. Seattle\u2019s CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks play, also is being retrofitted.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times wasn\u2019t allowed to tour the field hospital inside McCormick Place,, which Semonite described as a series of three-walled pods with a curtain at each opening. The metal-braced walls are the same ones vendors use during trade shows, he said. Each pod has a bed and chair. Nurses\u2019 stations are in the corridors.\n\nOxygen is being pumped into the field hospital, and engineers in McCormick Place have calibrated the heat and air-conditioning system to provide \u201cnegative pressure\u201d that keeps contaminants from escaping, Semonite said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to admit the staff in some of these big facilities is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI met with the leadership of McCormick yesterday. They\u2019re doing a lot of the work.\u201d\n\nSemonite said Walsh Construction is among contractors across the country who\u2019ve been asking to help the Army Corps.\n\n\u201cThis is not about trying to make a buck on a contract,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about taking care of the local citizens of this city, of this state, because these are all our people.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump said a couple of weeks ago, \u2018This is when America really needs to rally to be able to come together.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSemonite said one of his biggest aims is to make it as easy as possible for cities and states to build such field hospitals quickly.\n\nSemonite said the Army Corps\u2019 response to the pandemic in some respects is more difficult than the other big challenges he\u2019s been associated with in his more than 40-year military career, such as rebuilding communities after hurricanes swept through.\n\n\u201cWhen Mother Nature strikes, and even to a degree in combat operations, you have a pretty good understanding of what the set you\u2019re going to inherit is when a hurricane comes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying for 12 to 14 or 24 hours. But the next morning when you wake up, you kind of know what has to be built.\n\n\u201cAnd we kind of have defined the problem, and then we all attack. We don\u2019t know where this one\u2019s going to end. How long is this going to go? How long do facilities like this have to be run?\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely complicated challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are not going to be able to solve this with a complicated solution.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, Pritzker said he has toured the hospital being built at McCormick Place: \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could build something like that in five days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should all feel very, very proud of the work that\u2019s been done so quickly,\u201d Pritzker said, calling the carpenters, National Guardsmen and other workers at McCormick Place \u201cpatriotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know they are doing something that\u2019s going to save people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nContributing: Lynn Sweet","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":233,"url":"https:\/\/naturalnewsblogs.com\/are-cancer-patients-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-what-can-we-do\/","publisher":"Natural News","publish_date":"2020-04-03","author":"['Karen Berrios']","title":"Are cancer patients at higher risk of COVID-19?

Undoubtedly it is hard to believe that this is even real. Sometimes I think we are in a bad dream hoping to wake up soon. As a mother, the first thing that comes to mind is my family\u2019s safety. Understanding and implementing every precaution possible to protect my children is my top priority. Of course, due to my personal journey and now as a wellness blogger and health advocate I can\u2019t help to wonder how much of impact this COVID-19 disease may have on cancer patients.\n\nWe already know that cancer patients are immune-compromised, to begin with. Therefore, cancer patients automatically fall in the higher risk category. But what about those that are in the treatment and those that are in remission? According to a small study conducted in Wuhan, China, \u201cCancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection,\u201d the study, which was recently published in the Annals of Oncology, states. \u201cIt is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, researchers found \u201cmore than half (53.6%) of the patients involved in the study developed severe events\u2014defined by admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or death\u2014with 28.6% of the patients dying. This is far higher than the general COVID-19-infected population, which has an average clinically critical status rate of 4.7%, and a mortality rate of 2.3%.\u201d\n\nResearchers also wrote, \u201cPatients with lung cancer, with worse baseline lung function and endurance, are more likely to develop more severe anoxia and progress more rapidly with COVID-19\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a researcher but my common sense tells me that the conclusion found on this small study conducted ironically enough in Wuhan China makes a lot of sense. Of course, the outcome for cancer patients would be poor and more challenging if dealing with the COVID-19 in addition to cancer. This is why it is vital for patients to be proactive in their current treatment plan and implement a preventive plan not only to get tested but discuss with their medical\/ oncology team the possibilities before continuing with immunosuppressing treatments, making themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nWhat Can We Do?\n\nIn one of my most recent blog articles titled \u201cHow to fight the Coronavirus naturally\u201d I share additional helpful tips to help you boost your immunity and take additional precautions as a preventive mechanism for you to be safe during this crisis. Let me provide you with a quick summary:\n\nPractice the following to prevent and protect from the virus:\n\n\u2022 Social distancing (2 meters minimum) because the secretions that are the ones that contaminate cannot move more than 2 meters due to the weight of the virus.\n\n\u2022 Correct handwashing, for 20 seconds (both surfaces, anterior-posterior, interfaces, and fingertips) each time you come from outside or enter or leave any public space.\n\n\u2022 Use of masks when traveling through crowded areas (supermarkets, banks, hospitals, etc.)\n\n\u2022 Clean surfaces with disinfectant (especially those that may be in common and frequent contact)\n\nBoost your Immune System\n\nKeeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:\n\nTake a good Probiotic\n\nTake Vitamin D3\n\nVitamin C IV therapy\n\nTake Camu Camu Powder\n\nTake Beta Glucan\n\nEat Adaptogens like Maca\n\nFollow a Plant-based Diet\n\nMild Exercise\n\nRebound\n\nInfrared Sauna\n\nChiropractic Care\n\nColloidal Silver\n\nWater\n\nIf you like to learn more about each one of those recommendations read my article on \u201cHow to fight the Coronavirus Naturally.\u201d I hope you find this blog article helpful and as always I welcome your comments and I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me.

On a conference call, Mr. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, had just learned that several South Korean companies were ready to ship more coronavirus test kits to his state. But they were stymied because the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved their use.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if we have F.D.A. approval or not,\u201d Mr. Hogan said into a speakerphone in the governor\u2019s reception room, where he was flanked by a container of Purell and a 9 a.m. Diet Coke, with aides sitting six feet apart around a large table. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people dying,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait for permission.\u201d\nFrustrated by limited support and unclear guidance from the Trump administration, governors across the country, including some Republicans, have been squaring off with the White House and striking out on their own to secure supplies. Mr. Hogan, in his second term in a very blue state, has tried to stay miles ahead of the virus\u2019s incursion here, like several other governors \u2014 notably Jay Inslee of Washington and Mike DeWine of Ohio \u2014 whose responses have been given better marks from Americans than the president\u2019s.\nMr. Hogan put his health department on alert in early January when he saw the virus\u2019s deadly crawl through China. On Monday, he issued a stay-at-home order for residents, a few weeks after declaring a state of emergency when the first three cases emerged in Maryland last month.\nHe is also the head of the National Governors Association, charged with representing governors\u2019 needs at the White House, where officials wish he would find it in his heart to say a few flattering words about Mr. Trump now and then. Instead he has bluntly demanded more aid from Washington, including more test kits and supplies and help shoring up state budgets.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not satisfied\u201d with the federal response to states\u2019 needs, Mr. Hogan said this week.\nMr. Hogan has also found himself the de facto leader of the response in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where the disease has begun its exponential march. The governor of Virginia and the mayor of Washington \u2014 a city where the death rate is well above the national average \u2014 instantly followed his order this week, grounding around 15 million residents.\nAs of Thursday night, there have been at least 4,697 confirmed cases and 89 deaths in the three areas combined, about triple from a week ago. The two states and Washington have an unusually intrinsic relationship; they share a metro system and are home to thousands of federal workers who are central to the region\u2019s work force and the functioning of federal government.\nMr. Hogan\u2019s moves have major implications for the region. He has immediately hit those defiantly socializing with some of the largest fines or criminal charges in the nation. There have already been two arrests in Maryland, including of a man who hosted a bonfire party for about 60 people after the state banned large groups.\nHis aggressive policing is one of several reasons Mr. Hogan has slid onto center stage among governors whose states have been hammered by the coronavirus.\nThis week, he collaborated with a Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, on an opinion piece pleading for federal assistance \u2014 after President Trump attacked her as \u201cthat woman.\u201d He has been a critic of the president\u2019s overly optimistic prognostications, saying Mr. Trump\u2019s assurances that testing problems were a thing of the past were simply not true.\nFor Mr. Hogan, the need to respond quickly is also personal. He is a recent cancer survivor and over 60, which puts him in a high-risk group for the virus. His preparation for this moment, he said, was seeded in the 2015 Baltimore riots, which happened 90 days into his first term.\n\u201cI knew that taking quick decisive action was better than hesitating,\u201d he said in a (socially distant) interview in his office on Wednesday. \u201cI think the public was not where I was on the knowledge. There were folks saying this is no big deal, it\u2019s not as bad as the flu, it\u2019s going to disappear. And I was saying, \u2018No, it\u2019s worse.\u2019\u201d\nSome Democrats in Maryland have praised him for his aggressive response.\u201cLook, I\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d said Mary Pat Clarke, a city councilwoman from Baltimore. \u201cBut the governor has done an excellent job leading the state of Maryland through the Covid-19 state of our lives. He has been regular, he has been firm, he has been clear.\u201d\nWith an eye on the virus\u2019s rampage of China, Mr. Hogan convened a special session during the governors\u2019 meeting in February. They met with top health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right before the governors ran to put on formal wear for a White House dinner.\n\u201cVery little was being talked about,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cIt was sort of an eye-opener for a lot of the governors, but I think some of them still didn\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d\nHe, however, began to feel something akin to panic.\u201cThe next day I came back to my team and said, \u2018This is what I just heard, we have to get ready,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew that it wasn\u2019t going to be long before we were going to have to deal with it.\u201d\nMr. Hogan has also leaned on his wife, Yumi Hogan, a Korean immigrant, who was also at the governor\u2019s convention, which included a dinner at the Korean ambassador\u2019s home. As the first Korean first lady in American history, Ms. Hogan has become something of an icon in South Korea. \u201cI just grabbed my wife and said, \u2018Look, you speak Korean. You know the president. You know the first lady. You know the ambassador. Let\u2019s talk to them in Korean, and tell them we need their help.\u2019\u201d Several companies in South Korea immediately said they would send tests.\nMr. Hogan\u2019s super-cop moves have not endeared him to some conservatives who largely populate the more southern and rural parts of the state.\n\u201cI think the bubble the Governor is in is missing something,\u201d Gregory Kline, a longtime conservative activist in the state, said on Twitter. \u201cThere was no acknowledgment that his directions were doing harm to people greater than this disease would do or even that suffering is occurring not because of the disease but the executive fiat fighting it.\u201d\nMr. Hogan is one of the few elected Republicans in the country who have publicly countered Mr. Trump\u2019s early claims about the state of the virus, and more crucially about the amount of tests and ventilators available to states.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever crossed the line and been rude or tried to attack or point fingers or place blame. But I have been willing to stand up when other people haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cCertainly some of my Republican colleagues probably might think I go too far. Some of the Democratic colleagues might not think I go far enough. But I\u2019m not trying to place blame.\u201d\nSome officials said that the state could be faster in giving basic directives and that, like Mr. Hogan, they wished they could get more protective gear. \u201cThere are not enough supplies for health care workers and essential employees,\u201d said State Senator Jill Carter, a Democrat.\nMaryland has received far fewer N95 masks, respirators and gloves than it has requested from the federal government, according to documents released on Thursday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. And it has received none of the 100,000 swabs it requested for coronavirus test kits.\nMr. Hogan said his decisions were informed principally by health care professionals, many of them culled from the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, among other local health care providers.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on this, but I\u2019m going to listen to the smartest guys in the room,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThese guys say if we don\u2019t act now, we\u2019re going to have this surge, we\u2019re not going to have ventilators, we\u2019re going to overload the system. We\u2019re not going to have enough health care workers, we\u2019re going to look like New York, and there\u2019s going to be bodies stacked up.\u201d\nEvery day, there are dozens of decisions to be made over conference calls. Pay some state workers extra who have been called upon to report to work when most other Marylanders are being asked to remain home? Yes. How about for workers who check on child abuse reports? Also yes. Palm Sunday services permitted in church parking lots? Yes, but no passing of a collection plate. This debate went on for some time. \u201cWe don\u2019t like government telling churches what to do,\u201d Mr. Hogan said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want 2 million people to die.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":245,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/average-only-6-covid-19-infections-detected-worldwide\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-04-06","author":[],"title":"On Average Only 6% Of COVID-19 Infections Detected Worldwide?","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_326495436.jpeg","body_text":"According to research from the University of Gottingen as the number of confirmed cases continues to increase worldwide, the true numbers of infection may be dramatically underestimated.\n\nEstimates of COVID-19 mortality and time until death were used in a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases to test the quality of official case records, findings show that countries have only discovered on average about 6% of infections, and the number of infections globally may well have already reached several tens of millions.\n\nAccording to the report insufficient and delayed testing may explain why some countries are experiencing much higher casualty numbers relative to their reported confirmed cases such as Italy and Spain while Germany has detected as estimated 15.6% of infections compared to 3.5% in Italy and 1.7% in Spain. Detection rates are even lower in America at 1.6% and in the UK the rate is 1.2%, both of these two countries are receiving widespread criticism from global public health experts for their delayed response to the pandemic.\n\nSouth Korea appears to have discovered about half of their infections. As of March 31, 2020 Germany had 460,000 infections, based on the same method the researchers calculated that America has over 10 million infections, Spain has over 5 million, Italy has more than 3 million, and the UK has more than 2 million cases of infection. These calculations came on the same day that Johns Hopkins University reported that globally there were less than 900,000 confirmed cases, which means that the overwhelming vast majority of infections are undetected.\n\nBased on these findings international media outlets are parroting numbers from countries that are dramatically understating the true numbers of infection.\n\n\"These results mean that governments and policy-makers need to exercise extreme caution when interpreting case numbers for planning purposes.

The stress, panic, and anxiety over the global pandemic has spawned an array of sleep disorders, from insomnia to irregular sleep patterns to sleeping more than normal. Add in schedule changes brought on by working from home, trying to home school children, and stay entertained while isolating at home, and sleep is quickly becoming yet another casualty of COVID-19, even among those who normally don\u2019t struggle with sleep.\n\nUnfortunately, the lifestyle changes that the pandemic response demands are leading many people to engage in behaviors that are counterproductive to their sleep. After all, when you don\u2019t have to get up early for work or school, there\u2019s no reason not to binge on \u201cTiger King\u201d or the newest season of \u201cOzark.\u201d Even if you aren\u2019t getting caught up in a television series, it\u2019s likely that your days aren\u2019t following their typical rhythm. Instead of working from 8 to 5, you may be spending your evenings catching up on remote work and sleep takes a backseat.\n\nThe good news is that this pandemic won\u2019t last forever. The bad news is that the longer we\u2019re faced with shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, the more challenging it may be to return to normal routines. For that reason, it\u2019s important to develop good habits for coping with stress and anxiety -- and that includes maintaining good sleep habits.\n\nIn fact, maintaining good sleep habits can even help you maintain immunity to illness. Studies show that people who don\u2019t get enough sleep are more likely to get sick when exposed to a virus, so following these tips for managing your anxiety and getting sleep can help you weather this crisis and return to normal more successfully.\n\n6 Ways to Sleep When You Have Coronavirus Anxiety\n\nMaintain a Consistent Routine\n\nAs much as you can, try to maintain your typical sleep routine, going to bed and waking at your normal times. As tempting as it is to stay in bed, maintaining your regular patterns can help you retain a sense of normalcy that reduces stress, and ensures you maintain a healthy sleep cycle. Not to mention, when the restrictions are lifted, staying on your normal cycle ensures you won\u2019t have to reestablish your old patterns later.\n\nKeep Work Out of the Bedroom\n\nOne of the foundations of good sleep hygiene is to reserve the bedroom for sleep and sex only, and avoid working, watching television, or other activities. Avoid working in your bedroom (especially in bed) to keep work and sleep separate and avoid creating associations with stress that keep you awake.\n\nStay Active\n\nYou may not be able to keep up with your normal fitness routine right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should turn into a couch potato. Staying active not only helps regulate your sleep cycle, it also releases feel-good brain chemicals that can help you better manage your anxiety and stress. Take a walk, have a family dance party, or tackle some yard work outdoors to burn off excess energy and get your mind off of the news for a while.\n\nTurn Off the News\n\nThe news these days is often grim, and following the daily briefings, updates, and predictions can send even the most level-headed person into a tailspin of anxiety and panic. And it\u2019s not just information overload that\u2019s contributing to sleep disruption. When you spend hours glued to your devices looking for updates, the increased levels of blue light disrupt your body\u2019s natural melatonin production, ultimately making it more difficult to sleep.\n\nTo keep your feelings under control while staying informed, set boundaries regarding news consumption. For example, consider only watching the news for updates in the early morning or dinner hour, and stick to broadcasts that focus on the headlines, not opinion or interpretation. Avoid consuming the news before bed, which can keep you awake.\n\nLearn New Coping Strategies\n\nMany of the common strategies we use to deal with stress, such as getting together with friends or shopping, are off-limits at this time. Use this time to develop new strategies, such as trying a new hobby like painting or jigsaw puzzles, or tackle that stack of books you\u2019ve been meaning to read. You might even find hobbies that you will continue after the emergency ends.\n\nDon\u2019t Worry About Sleep\n\nIt sounds counterintuitive, but worrying about your sleep only makes it more difficult to sleep. When you\u2019re anxious about sleep, it only creates more stress. If you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, focus on maintaining your normal schedule and stress reduction, rather than forcing yourself to sleep. When you get into bed, don\u2019t make sleep your goal, but rather relaxation. Again, limiting your news consumption before bed and making that time \u201cme time\u201d to relax with a warm bath or shower, some light stretching, and some light entertainment (like reading a book) can help you get into a good place to sleep.\n\nAbove all, remember that this crisis is temporary. It may seem endless right now, but eventually the emergency will pass and life will return to some semblance of normal. Keeping perspective, and doing everything you can to stay healthy will help you weather the storm.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":261,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/7\/21213101\/mlb-starting-2020-season-in-may-30-teams-arizona-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-07","author":"['Rick Telander']","title":"Let\u2019s play ball, however strange it is","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/TYNOa5GXjDJVFypMHUy_7xC5h9o=\/0x26:546x312\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19883218\/Screen_Shot_2020_04_07_at_8.47.17_PM.png","body_text":"It was almost exactly a quarter-century ago that I wrote my first column for the Sun-Times: April 2, 1995.\n\nIt was a weird one.\n\nMy little son, my father-in-law and I went to a spring-training game between the White Sox and Red Sox at old Ed Smith Field in Sarasota, Florida. The weird part was, there were no major-leaguers playing.\n\nThe baseball strike was raging, had been for more than a half-year. The 1994 World Series had been canceled.\n\nAnd on that beautiful spring day, there was no solution in sight.\n\nI wrote that no batters could reach the outfield wall, that we were studying somebody named Pookie Bernstine, that the beer was still nice and cold. But it was strange. Not right. Just . . . not right.\n\nNow Major League Baseball is floating the idea of starting the 2020 season, which has been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, sometime in May with all 30 teams in Arizona.\n\nTalk about weird.\n\nGames would be played before no fans in spring-training stadiums and at the Diamondbacks\u2019 Chase Field. Players would sit six feet apart in the stands. There would be no mound visits, and plate umpires would stand way behind the catchers. Old-buzzard managers and antique clubhouse guys, we\u2019ll assume, would wear masks, latex gloves and maybe full-body plastic suits.\n\nCrazy.\n\nThe thing is, it would be baseball. With real major-leaguers playing.\n\nHow could anyone be against that?\n\nBaseball is such a powerful symbol in America \u2014 of springtime, rebirth, stability and a deep psychological connection to our past \u2014 that the major leagues played right on through World Wars I and II. Not to play would have been to further traumatize the souls of the men and women fighting overseas.\n\nIndeed, on Jan. 15, 1942, five weeks after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis about that exact thing.\n\n\u2018\u2018I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going,\u2019\u2019 Roosevelt wrote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has weighed in on pro sports, too, saying, for instance, that he fully expects the NFL season to start on time in September. But expectations aren\u2019t facts. And Trump previously said he anticipated all of us being jammed joyously into churches on Easter, four days from now. As if.\n\nIt\u2019s possible May is way too soon to bring people together in numbers large enough and close enough to each other to play baseball. The virus still is raging in April, remember. Indeed, as I write this, Illinois has just recorded its largest one-day death toll \u2014 73 \u2014 since the virus struck.\n\nWill the players be immune in a month or so? Will they be so closely guarded that nobody in the entire Arizona baseball family will bring the virus into the ballpark?\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s no way some double plays won\u2019t get a player closer to a middle infielder than safe social distancing. How about pitchers going to their mouth? All that spitting, sliding, sweating?\n\nAnd to play in June? And then in July, August and September in the desert? Whoa, baby. Ever been to Phoenix in the summer? I have. I remember my shoes sticking to the melting asphalt in a parking lot as though glued there.\n\nSo day games are out, and you\u2019d have to cram schedules for 30 teams into night games at the 10 practice stadiums and Chase Field.\n\nMLB and the players\u2019 union already are saying they could play seven-inning doubleheaders at night. Extra innings? Call it a tie and move on.\n\nYou see, there\u2019s an answer for every problem if both sides are adaptable.\n\nEverybody sequestered like monks in off-limits hotels scattered around the valley? Sure. Why not?\n\nIt could be done. Broadcasts on TV. Players miked for the fans\u2019 enjoyment. Crowd noise piped in. Scratching and gum-chewing still allowed.\n\nFights? Maybe you\u2019d have to don gloves and surgical masks before throwing down.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget that MLB is a $10 billion enterprise. You don\u2019t jam in the plug on that kind of spigot unless you absolutely have to.\n\nMaybe none of this will happen. Instant coronavirus tests, available to all, could change much. A COVID-19 vaccine would solve all.\n\nBut bring it on, I say.\n\nIsn\u2019t playing ball what baseball players live to do?","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":275,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/08\/science\/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-09","author":"['Carl Zimmer']","title":"Most New York Coronavirus Cases Came From Europe, Genomes Show","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/04\/14\/science\/09VIRUS-MUTATIONS1\/09VIRUS-MUTATIONS1-facebookJumbo.jpg","body_text":"New research indicates that the coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that travelers brought in the virus mainly from Europe, not Asia.\n\u201cThe majority is clearly European,\u201d said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review.\nA separate team at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine came to strikingly similar conclusions, despite studying a different group of cases. Both teams analyzed genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers starting in mid-March.\nThe research revealed a previously hidden spread of the virus that might have been detected if aggressive testing programs had been put in place.\nOn Jan. 31, President Trump barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks.\nIt would not be until late February that Italy would begin locking down towns and cities, and March 11 when Mr. Trump said he would block travelers from most European countries. But New Yorkers had already been traveling home with the virus.\n\u201cPeople were just oblivious,\u201d said Adriana Heguy, a member of the N.Y.U. team.Dr. Heguy and Dr. van Bakel belong to an international guild of viral historians. They ferret out the history of outbreaks by poring over clues embedded in the genetic material of viruses taken from thousands of patients.\nViruses invade a cell and take over its molecular machinery, causing it to make new viruses.The process is quick and sloppy. As a result, new viruses can gain a new mutation that wasn\u2019t present in their ancestor. If a new virus manages to escape its host and infect other people, its descendants will inherit that mutation.\nTracking viral mutations demands sequencing all the genetic material in a virus \u2014 its genome. Once researchers have gathered the genomes from a number of virus samples, they can compare their mutations.\nSophisticated computer programs can then figure out how all of those mutations arose as viruses descended from a common ancestor. If they get enough data, they can make rough estimates about how long ago those ancestors lived. That\u2019s because mutations arise at a roughly regular pace, like a molecular clock.\nMaciej Boni of Penn State University and his colleagues recently used this method to see where the coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, came from in the first place. While conspiracy theories might falsely claim the virus was concocted in a lab, the virus\u2019s genome makes clear that it arose in bats.\nThere are many kinds of coronaviruses, which infect both humans and animals. Dr. Boni and his colleagues found that the genome of the new virus contains a number of mutations in common with strains of coronaviruses that infect bats.\nThe most closely related coronavirus is in a Chinese horseshoe bat, the researchers found. But the new virus has gained some unique mutations since splitting off from that bat virus decades ago.\nDr. Boni said that ancestral virus probably gave rise to a number of strains that infected horseshoe bats, and perhaps sometimes other animals.\n\u201cVery likely there\u2019s a vast unsampled diversity,\u201d he said.Copying mistakes aren\u2019t the only way for new viruses to arise. Sometimes two kinds of coronaviruses will infect the same cell. Their genetic material gets mixed up in new viruses.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible, Dr. Boni said, in the past 10 or 20 years, a hybrid virus arose in some horseshoe bat that was well-suited to infect humans, too. Later, that virus somehow managed to cross the species barrier.\n\u201cOnce in a while, one of these viruses wins the lottery,\u201d he said.In January, a team of Chinese and Australian researchers published the first genome of the new virus. Since then, researchers around the world have sequenced over 3,000 more. Some are genetically identical to each other, while others carry distinctive mutations.\nThat\u2019s just a tiny sampling of the full diversity of the virus. As of April 8, there were 1.5 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, and the true total is probably many millions more. But already, the genomes of the virus are revealing previously hidden outlines of its history over the past few months.\nAs new genomes come to light, researchers upload them to an online database called GISAID. A team of virus evolution experts are analyzing the growing collection of genomes in a project called Nextstrain. They continually update the virus family tree.\nThe deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China. The Nextstrain team has also used the mutation rate to determine that the virus probably first moved into humans from an animal host in late 2019. On Dec. 31, China announced that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new respiratory illness.\nIn January, as the scope of the catastrophe in China became clear, a few countries started an aggressive testing program. They were able to track the arrival of the virus on their territory and track its spread through their populations.\nBut the United States fumbled in making its first diagnostic kits and initially limited testing only to people who had come from China and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.\n\u201cIt was a disaster that we didn\u2019t do testing,\u201d Dr. Heguy said.A few cases came to light starting at the end of January. But it was easy to dismiss them as rare imports that did not lead to local outbreaks.\nThe illusion was dashed at the end of February by Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, and his colleagues.\nUsing Nextstrain, they showed that a virus identified in a patient in late February had mutation shared by one identified in Washington on Jan. 20.\nThe Washington viruses also shared other mutations in common with ones isolated in Wuhan, suggesting that a traveler had brought the coronavirus from China.\nWith that discovery, Dr. Bedford and his colleagues took the lead in sequencing coronavirus genomes. Sequencing more genomes around Washington gave them a better view of how the outbreak there got started.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite confident that it was not spreading in December in the United States,\u201d Dr. Bedford said. \u201cThere may have been a couple other introductions in January that didn\u2019t take off in the same way.\u201d\nAs new cases arose in other parts of the country, other researchers set up their own pipelines. The first positive test result in New York came on March 1, and after a couple of weeks, patients surged into the city\u2019s hospitals.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018We need to do this for New York,\u2019\u201d Dr. Heguy said.Dr. Heguy and her colleagues found some New York viruses that shared unique mutations not found elsewhere. \u201cThat\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve had a silent transmission for a while,\u201d she said.\nDr. Heguy estimated that the virus began circulating in the New York area a couple of months ago.And researchers at Mount Sinai started sequencing the genomes of patients coming through their hospital. They found that the earliest cases identified in New York were not linked to later ones.\n\u201cTwo weeks later, we start seeing viruses related to each other,\u201d said Ana Silvia Gonzalez-Reiche, a member of the Mount Sinai team.\nDr. Gonzalez-Reiche and her colleagues found that these viruses were practically identical to viruses found around Europe. They cannot say on what particular flight a particular virus arrived in New York. But they write that the viruses reveal \u201ca period of untracked global transmission between late January to mid-February.\u201d\nSo far, the Mount Sinai researchers have identified seven separate lineages of viruses that entered New York and began circulating. \u201cWe will probably find more,\u201d Dr. van Bakel said.\nThe coronavirus genomes are also revealing hints of early cross-country travel.Dr. van Bakel and his colleagues found one New York virus that was identical to one of the Washington viruses found by Dr. Bedford and his colleagues. In a separate study, researchers at Yale found another Washington-related virus. Combined, the two studies hint that the coronavirus has been moving from coast to coast for several weeks.\nSidney Bell, a computational biologist working with the Nextstrain team, cautions people not to read too much into these new mutations themselves. \u201cJust because something is different doesn\u2019t mean it matters,\u201d Dr. Bell said.\nMutations do not automatically turn viruses into new, fearsome strains. They often don\u2019t bring about any change at all. \u201cTo me, mutations are inevitable and kind of boring,\u201d Dr. Bell said. \u201cBut in the movies, you get the X-Men.\u201d\nPeter Thielen, a molecular biologist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, likes to think of the spread of viruses like a dandelion seed landing on an empty field.\nThe flower grows up and produces seeds of its own. Those seeds spread and sprout. New mutations arise over the generations as the dandelions fill the field. \u201cBut they\u2019re all still dandelions,\u201d Mr. Thielen said.\nWhile the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don\u2019t have any apparent effect on how the virus works.\nThat\u2019s good news for scientists working on a vaccine.Vaccine developers hope to fight Covid-19 by teaching our bodies to make antibodies that can grab onto the virus and block its entry into cells.\nSome viruses evolve so quickly that they require vaccines that can produce several different antibodies. That\u2019s not the case for Covid-19. Like other coronaviruses, it has a relatively slow mutation rate compared to some viruses, like influenza.\nAs hard as the fight against it may be, its mutations reveal that things can be a whole lot worse.Of course, the coronavirus will continue to mutate as long as it still infects people. It\u2019s possible that vaccines will have to change to keep up with the virus. And that\u2019s why scientists need to keep tracking its history.\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":276,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/09\/learning\/what-students-are-saying-about-remote-learning.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-09","author":[],"title":"What Students Are Saying About Remote Learning","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/03\/11\/us\/11virus-onlineschools5-CECLN\/11virus-onlineschools5-facebookJumbo.png","body_text":"Please note: This post is part of The Learning Network\u2019s ongoing Current Events Conversation feature. We invite students to react to the news via our daily writing prompts and, each week, we publish a selection of their comments.\n\nIn \u201cCoronavirus Is Shutting Schools. Is America Ready for Virtual Learning?\u201d Dana Goldstein writes about the great shift that began taking place in American education last month. For this week\u2019s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked students how they have been coping with remote learning.\nThey told us about all the things they miss about going to school: their friends, teachers, sports, extracurricular activities, even \u201cthe loud and crazy lunchroom.\u201d\nBut some students have discovered that they enjoy getting to work at their own pace, set their own schedule and be free from \u201cthe stressful environment of school.\u201d\nOthers, though, recounted the challenges of distance learning, from struggling to understand assignments and getting easily distracted to not having reliable internet. \u201cIf you had told me a few months ago that I would be praying to go to school, I would\u2019ve laughed and called you crazy, but I would do anything to go back to my school,\u201d Hannah from Nashville said.\nBefore we get to the rest of the comments, we\u2019d like to give a warm welcome to the new students who joined the conversation this week from: Barcelona; Berkeley, Calif.; Brighton, Mich.; Buckeye, Ariz.; Dawson High School; Easton, Conn.; Englewood, Colo.; Forest Lake Christian School, Auburn, Calif.; Fruitland, Idaho; Fulton Science Academy, Alpharetta, Ga.; Hawkins, Ind.; Irving, Tex.; Lacey, Wash.; Lawrenceville, N.J.; London; Long Beach, Wash.; Malverne, N.Y.; Martin Luther School-Maspeth, Queens, N.Y.; Mexico; New Orleans, La.; Rochester, N.Y.; Roland Grise Middle School; Sunnyvale, Calif.; WLSA Shanghai Academy and Yakima, Wash.\nPlease note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.\n_________\n\u2018I did not realize that I took my routine and school day for granted until now.\u2019School is a place for building friendships, learning responsibility, and getting an escape from the house, but it seems as though the Coronavirus has taken that all away from us. For me, I loved getting to see my friends everyday in the school environment. Now that it\u2019s taken away from me, I realize now that school was my main source of communicating with people. Now I feel as though I\u2019m losing friendships I had at school since we can\u2019t go anymore. School also taught us responsibility. I had a schedule when going to classes and when to wake up and go to bed. Now that I have no reason to have a schedule, I have been going to bed and waking up much later than I used to. There also seems to be a lack of motivation for me now to accomplish tasks because at school, we were given an hour and a half each day to get work done in class but now I keep pushing assignments back until the last second. This definitely won\u2019t be beneficial to my work ethic in the upcoming senior year for me \u2026 Thanks to the Coronavirus, I have decided to make every moment of my senior year count and not take it for granted as I did for the past three years of high school.\u2014 Owen Midgette, Norfolk, VA\nI did not realize that I took my routine and school day for granted until now. My online school day consists of waking up at 10 am instead of 6 am, working on my laptop in my bed instead of a classroom, and now I make my own schedule. While this sounds pretty enjoyable for any teenager, it has made me miss school. I miss walking down the hallways with my friends. I miss sitting in a classroom with a teacher and other students, having discussions and asking questions. I miss the loud and crazy lunchroom. I truly miss things I didn\u2019t even know that I loved about my school. If you had told me a few months ago that I would be praying to go to school, I would\u2019ve laughed and called you crazy, but I would do anything to go back to my school.\u2014 Hannah, Nashville\nSomething I find really special about my high school is that we are really focused on student-centered learning. We use a Harkness-style teaching method where all the students and the teacher sit at a round table together and instead of learning through lecturing, we learn from each other. Peer-to-peer interaction is a really pivotal part of education at my school, and it feels like it falls so short in our distance learning. We use Zoom and can see one another and our teacher, but everyone is always muted so as not to interfere with background noise. Our classes have been cut down by ten minutes and instead of having six classes a day, we only have three or four classes synchronously. I feel like my education is not being fulfilled. I have a significant lack of motivation and I miss the thought-provoking discussions I used to have with my classmates during physical school. I am really anxious to get back to school and really foster my love of learning through my peers.\u2014 Emily Barkley, Lawrenceville, NJ\n\u2018The workload has been overwhelming.\u2019\u201cOh my goodness \u2026 Why there is so much homework?\u201d This was my first reaction to online study as I looked at the homework checklist. Due to the outbreak, most activities, including daily clubs, are canceled at present, thus we do not have much to do at home. At least teachers believe so; therefore, tons of homework overwhelms us everyday. However, we actually get much to do everyday besides homework: standardized tests, such as TOEFL, SAT, AP, etc., needed to be prepared; activities that could be done indoor had to be completed \u2026 Homework is the straw which breaks the camel\u2019s back. How I hope that assignment could be a little less and more time could be controllable by ourselves! I am now in China. Online study has already taken place for 2 months so far. Sometimes I really wish to go back to school having lessons face to face with teachers and classmates. School is not only a place for study, but a place to prepare us for future life when we embark upon complicated society and interpersonal relationship. Online education cannot replace school system thoroughly in this aspect. I really miss normal school days. Is the day of returning far?\u2014 Sophie Dai, WLSA Shanghai Academy\nThe workload \u2026 has been overwhelming. The thought process of my teachers seems to be \u201cOh they have all of this free time now, so I can assign them more work than I normally would.\u201d  Or at least something along the lines of that, because my teachers haven\u2019t let up one bit. That\u2019s been the most challenging part of remote learning, because I get easily distracted when I try to work in my house, and that I have even more work than normal, it\u2019s challenging to get everything done. I have been able to keep up with what we\u2019ve been learning for the most part, but it would be nice to have a teacher that could answer my questions and help me in person.\u2014 William, The Barker\nI\u2019m in my second week of online distance learning and it\u2019s exhausting! Yes, school now starts at 9 am and we end at around 2:30, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing school work all day. However, now I\u2019m on the computer for about 4 or 5 hours at a time. Before the whole pandemic happened, I only spent about an hour, maybe 2 on the computer both at school and at home. At the end of the day, I don\u2019t want to see another computer for a while. I actually did some research (on the computer) and I found that I was suffering from computer fatigue. Yep, it\u2019s a real thing.\u2014 Miriam, Oakland, CA\nI also find it very hard to find an \u2018escape\u2019 from school. Since it all takes place at my home, destressing has become more difficult because I feel like school is there with me the entire day. I really hope, in the near future, we will be returning to our school since I am not receiving the best education at home.\u2014 Zoe V., Nashville, TN\n\u2018I find it impossible to actually learn anything new through the distance learning.\u2019From what I have been through for the past two weeks is that online schooling is really a double edge knife. For example, it\u2019s quite nice working at your own pace so you\u2019re able to be less stressed with deadlines. But at the same time because of that, I have had a great deal of trouble keeping up with all of the work that my teachers have been putting onto me. That\u2019s mostly because my pace is slower than most of my other classmates because my dyslexia and ADHD make it a lot harder to keep things on track because of how free things are. My teachers have been very understanding about it but there is only some much that they can do and I\u2019m honestly quite scared for my end of the year grades. I have done fine this year grade-wise A\u2019s and B\u2019s but since this started they have been going down a bit and I\u2019m not sure what to do because I\u2019m doing what I can but it\u2019s not doing anything to help my grades go up. So I\u2019m just praying for the best at this point.\u2014 Stephan T, Easton CT\nI enjoy the new schedule that internet school has given me, since I finally have time to sleep as much as I need and feel well rested and ready to work. Though my new schedule is beneficial, I find it impossible to actually learn anything new through the distance learning. It\u2019s easier for me to get distracted and be lazy with my work, so I\u2019m starting to hate the daily mundanity of distance learning. I never thought I\u2019d want to be back in school until now.\u2014 Cali, King of Prussia, PA\nDigital learning hasn\u2019t been the best experience for me. I\u2019m constantly caught in this game of tug of war of too much work and too little. Sometimes I\u2019ll have three projects and four assignments due in one day and other days, I\u2019ll have nothing. The lack of social interaction I, as well as my classmates, are enduring is also a huge factor in me not enjoying online schooling. Only one of my classes has actual online meetings where we can talk, while the others just keep posting work. I can\u2019t learn like that though, so I haven\u2019t really retained any of the information I just spit back at them for a grade.\u2014 Emma B., Cass High School, Georgia\n\u2018I\u2019m often anxious that I will not be able to join and maintain access to online classes and assignments.\u2019Online school has been a stressful process for many of my friends and me. I live in an area where internet access and WiFi are hard to get and, as a result, I\u2019m not only stressed about school but I\u2019m often anxious that I will not be able to join and maintain access to online classes and assignments. Working at home is hard for me as well since there is no distinct separation of school v.s home. Normally at school, I am able to focus as it is a work environment and I am constantly communicating face-to-face with those around me. At home, I want to get up and go outside and stop staring at my iPad, it gives me headaches and I am tired of looking at it after 4-5 hours a day. Many of my teachers have been seemingly understanding of the issues caused by online school, but at the same time, they are continuing to give the normal work-load.\u2014 Kitty, Stockton, NJ\nSo far, no, our schools have not yet switched to online. However, they have given us a long list of websites and activity suggestions to keep students occupied in learning while the School District figures out what to do for us \u2026 My sister and I just recently came up with our own schedules (which consists of some of the suggested websites and activities of our own) which was fun! I started my school schedule today, since I just got off of Spring Break. My biggest concern, if they do switch to online (which will most likely occur soon) is the lack of technology my family has (like Dana Goldstein writes about in the first paragraph of the article). The School District just sent out a survey to see who is lacking the school supplies necessary to be involved in online school, so hopefully they will be able to rent out computers to families who need them, like mine. We only have one laptop, and sharing one with a timed schedule would be impossible! I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed! :)\u2014 Leah, Springfield, OR\n\u2018I miss seeing everyone, especially my friends.\u2019Out of the concerns that Ms. Goldstein expresses, the most relevant one is how schools provide so much more than academics. Social interaction, a way to exercise \u2026 I miss seeing everyone, especially my friends, even that teacher who talks too much \u2026 I mean, at least they\u2019re there to explain the assignment. Zoom calls and texting and Google Hangouts just can\u2019t replace face-to-face interaction. I\u2019m a dancer too, and dance has always been so infallible to me, I felt like even if schools shut down it would somehow still be there. But it wasn\u2019t. Sometimes I just feel really lost because I feel like I don\u2019t have anything to hold onto. I\u2019m just trying to do well in \u201cclass\u201d and waiting for this to end.\u2014 Julia A, California\nI too believe that school is more than just academics alone. School is what makes the basis of our early lives, 14 years of work, stress, and success. Not to mention all the great people you meet along the way, such as our mentors and teachers, as well as our lifelong friends. The activities I miss the most in school are going to my locker early in the morning, having quick chats with friends and colleagues, and roaming the halls listening to music. After school activities are another story, I miss going to track practice, making jokes with friends on a local loop (1.5 mile run around campus), and getting a good workout in for the day (thanks Mr. Frazer).\u2014 Ethan Davila, New York\n\u2018I am actually quite fond of it.\u2019Last week was the second week of E-Learning for my school, and I am actually quite fond of it. While I do understand the social aspect of school \u2014 as someone with an Anxiety Disorder lack of sleep and work load gets to me quickly, making this honestly an enjoyable experience for me. I feel as though I can learn the material at my own pace and on my own time, with breaks when I need them. With the stressful environment of school being significantly reduced, in my mind the pros of E-Learning outweigh the cons. I enjoy getting to know my teachers and classmates but I think there is a lot to be learned from the teaching and learning style we\u2019ve had to embrace.\u2014 Ella Mastin, Glenbard West HS\nWith the new shift to online schooling, I feel like an adult working from home. I get to organize my work schedule so that it works best for me, and I get to complete all of my work from the comfort of my own room. In the mornings I put on a nice shirt, so I look put together when attending online instructional Zoom or Microsoft Teams meetings, but what the camera, my teachers, and my peers cannot see is that I am actually lounging around in the comfort of my sweatpants.\u2014 Tracey N, Dawson HS\nBefore a normal school day involved me waking up at 5:45 and returning home at 3:30. Now, I wake up at whatever time I\u2019d like, which has had a positive effect on me, reducing my levels of stress overall. I find that I am able to stay on task effectively, as I am able to work at my own pace and at the time I choose to. I find myself adequately occupied with work, as I have spent an average of 3 hours a day on schoolwork, which I feel is the same amount of work I completed in school, with the rest of the hours wasted on irrelevant information. I miss the social aspect most of school, as a social life is impossible to maintain virtually \u2026 In addition, the freed time has allowed me to pursue interests not supported by the public school system, as I have had more time to learn to code, and even accomplished creating a Virtual Private Network from scratch.\u2014 David Vallejo, Miami\nSince I can plan out my day myself, I feel it suits me better than what school puts students through, though it is challenging to learn new topics of some subjects without direct explanation from a teacher.\u2014 Alicja Paruch, NY\n\u2018A lot of the time, I get confused.\u2019I am starting my third week of remote learning and let me tell you, I can not wait for the day this whole thing is over. My school went directly into remote learning around the time the first confirmed case was found in my state and I do not like it. I find myself getting distracted much easier and find myself procrastinating more and more. I\u2019m not motivated to complete some work until I realize it will impact my grade, unlike normal school. A lot of the time, I get confused. I don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to ask my teacher why I need to do different when I don\u2019t understand something or don\u2019t know what to do and a lot of the time, an email doesn\u2019t get back to me in the time I am completing my work.\u2014 Tommy J, Saco\nMy first weeks of online classes have been hard because it\u2019s difficult to stay on task with all the work we are being assigned by teachers. The work isn\u2019t necessarily hard but figuring out how to use the different websites and when a new assignment has been posted takes a while. I am getting better at this as I go just like my classmates but sometimes I\u2019ll miss some assignments I didn\u2019t realize were due.\u2014 Gerlanda Di Stefano, Malverne NY\nAs someone who\u2019s family is financially stable and has access to a computer, I can say that it hasn\u2019t been extremely hard for me to get my work done. It was hard whenever I didn\u2019t understand something and instead of being able to ask my teachers and get an immediate response, I had to email them and wait for them to email me back. I believe that I have it very lucky and I know that some of my peers are struggling a lot.\nI know that my school is trying very hard to help the kids, like providing food for children that relied on school lunches and having a curbside pickup for laptop rentals. They also have paper packets that they mailed so if you didn\u2019t have access to the internet you could still continue learning and not get too far behind, which helps eliminate Dana Goldstein\u2019s concern in that area, but there are still valid points that Goldstein makes that are still problems at my school as well.\u2014 Morgan Sharp, Anna, Texas\nHere in England we were all told that schools would almost certainly not shut and if they did it wouldn\u2019t be until after Easter. However, our PM closed schools until September and cancelled all exams all of a sudden, even though he said a few hours before he wouldn\u2019t even close them for two weeks so none of our teachers were prepared. Frustratingly, my school isn\u2019t using Zoom or Google Classroom (and neither are any others that I\u2019ve heard of) but are instead putting work on to the shared area online which we have to manually search through hundreds of files everyday to find that work that has been set for our classes. Only one subject, English has actually given us instructions and tasks to complete with a weekly deadline \u2014 the others have just uploaded random files and past papers etc and not told us what to do or when its due \u2026 I find it really hard to be motivated to do work \/ study for exams I am not even going to be taking. I wish my school would make all subjects give us specific tasks with deadlines and maybe use online resources such as Google Classroom so that we have more structure.\u2014 Rachel, London, England\n\u2018I\u2019m missing out on my \u201chigh school experience.\u201d\u2019The worst part of this experience is the fact that I finally made it to high school and now I\u2019m missing out on my \u201chigh school experience.\u201d Everyone talks about how high school is some of the greatest years of our life, but right now it\u2019s not off to a spectacular start. I\u2019m only a freshman, but the poor seniors are getting hit the hardest. Not being in school means there\u2019s no sports, no school dances like Prom, and there might not even be a graduation at this point. Imagine getting to senior year and thinking that it\u2019s going to be the best year overall, and then getting told that you won\u2019t get to finish your final season of the sport you\u2019ve played your whole life, or you can\u2019t go to your last dance with the people you\u2019ve been with all of high school. These people might not get to even experience graduation. All of their hard work for the past four years might get handed to them in the form of a PDF or a document in the mailbox.\u2014 Natalie, Yakima, WA\nI have been training for weeks to make state competition for poetry interpretation in Speech and Debate, and to see all my hard work go down the drain is disheartening. I felt like that opportunity was robbed from me. Since I am a junior, I now have to wait until senior year to attempt to attend state and it would be my last chance to do it. I really wish I was able to give it a shot this year.\u2014 Jessica Franklin, Dawson High School, TX\nPersonally the main thing I miss is my sports season, I was looking forward to this years lacrosse season the whole year and it was heart breaking to be on day 4 and have it be cancelled.\u2014 James, Barkoukis\nOne of the things I\u2019m missing about school is theater. Before school was closed, I had two shows that were going to be performed the next week and now I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll ever be able to perform the shows. Overall, this remote learning is an F in my book.\u2014 Kayla C., Cass High School, Georgia\n\u2018I\u2019ve had to become my seven-year-old brother\u2019s teacher.\u2019Everyday my motivation to do my work decreases and recently all my assignments have been turned in late causing my grades to drop. It has also been very difficult because I\u2019ve had to become my seven-year-old brother\u2019s teacher. My parents aren\u2019t very fluent in English, so they aren\u2019t able to help him with his schoolwork. It\u2019s very challenging to keep up with both his work and my work at the same time.\u2014 Adriana Segura, Cass High School, GA\nThe switch to distance learning has been hard for my family. I\u2019m lucky enough to go to a school that provides each student with a computer, but for the first two weeks my younger brother (age 9) didn\u2019t. He was sent home with a folder packed with work, but once that ran out, his teacher expected him to go digital. We have a computer, but it\u2019s barely functioning, let alone good enough to run the programs they expected us to use. This was later remedied, but he\u2019s also on an IEP which means he\u2019s used to one on one learning for math, science, and reading as well as holds a general animosity towards learning in general. We\u2019re terrified for what this will do to the progress he\u2019s made. My mom has been struggling to teach it to him so she\u2019s been enlisting my help. I\u2019m happy to do it, but now I\u2019m tackling two work loads a day on top of everything else going on.\u2014 Kaylee Tener, Holicong Middle School\n\u2018I\u2019ve noticed that staying on task gets harder as the week goes on.\u2019The only thing familiar about my \u201cschool days\u201d is getting up in the morning. The similarities come to an abrupt stop there. I eat breakfast each morning with my mom, who now works from home, and converse with her frequently throughout the day. Having a chance to connect with her in this way has is something I am grateful for. During the scheduled lunch break my school includes in its remote learning class schedule, I frequently take naps, mostly out of boredom. Far more distractions \u2014 my pet and the availability of food all the time, to name a few \u2014 abound as I try to remain engaged in classes and complete assignments. For the most part I am on task, but some of the very same distractions I deal with in school, such as receiving texts from friends or my phone serving as a distraction in and of itself \u2014 seem much harder to resist at home. For the most part, though, as a high school senior, I know and accept what work I have to complete and I return to the tried and tested routines that have served me well throughout my high school years.\u2014 Aaliyah Rogers, Martin Luther School-Maspeth, Queens, NY\nA school day for me is very different than what I\u2019m used to. I now wake up an hour after I would normally be getting to school, so that\u2019s three hours of extra sleep. I think because of this, my sleep schedule is messed up and I don\u2019t have the structure we used to all get. I\u2019ve noticed that staying on task gets harder as the week goes on. We\u2019re obviously not at school working with our classmates and teachers, so it is hard for me to focus \u2026 There\u2019s no structure, which is making it hard to get up and be productive. Overall, online school makes time management extremely difficult and I feel like I\u2019m not even learning in some of my classes.\u2014 Riley S, Brooklyn, NY\n\u2018How harshly are AP exams going to be graded now?\u2019Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Collegeboard announced massive changes to the AP tests: students only have 45 minutes, the tests are now only free response questions, and the major twist, the exams are now online. With this new information, as well as the fact that Collegeboard cut down on the curriculum we are being tested on, many of my classes switched from learning new material to review mode. Instead of preparing for multiple choice questions, I must now scramble to prepare for a writing only test that will determine my fate on whether I receive college credit for the many AP classes I have spent a year taking. My biggest fear now is that it is unknown how the new shortened tests will be graded, leaving me with only the written portion to get a good score on the exam. This added stress was not something I needed in an already stressful year.\u2014 Ryan C, Dawson High School\nAs a junior, I have been very stressed about how the rest of the school year will pan out. Constant thoughts running through my head are, \u201cWhen am I going to take the SAT? How harshly are AP exams going to be graded now? What are colleges going to do for admissions next year?\u201d All of these questions are constant thoughts that most teenagers my age are thinking about right now. The work that we are being provided with now is only supplementary; which, does not help students stay motivated to get their work completed. Teachers are doing the best they can but the ones who truly care about their students\u2019 mental health and education are putting in extra time just to help. Sadly, I have one teacher who I know I can count on to go to because she has been sending out constant emails about our AP exams and always asking how we are doing. If as many teachers cared as much as she did, then maybe more students would want to do their work \u2026\u2014 Amaya Lancaster, Branham High School, San Jose, CA\n\u2018I feel for our teachers who have had to change everything about their classes.\u2019Luckily I have pretty good computer knowledge, but like Ms. Goldstein pointed out, I feel for our teachers who have had to change everything about their classes. Asking teachers to all of sudden offer the same kind of curriculum online is impossible, so it is important we stay patient \u2026 I\u2019m not really thinking about what I need from my teachers as much as what our teachers need from us. All we have to do is stay on task and take this seriously while they have to change their jobs from in school to online in a matter of days. The workload isn\u2019t unbearable and the teachers are very lenient, but as long as we don\u2019t take advantage of this and stay diligent we can all get through this.\u2014 Estevan, Corpus Christi, Texas","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":284,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/10\/21216172\/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-10","author":"['Josh Dzieza']","title":"Warehouse workers are forcing Amazon to take COVID-19 seriously","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/DJh0MZ_isut43sYqiB7BrdaoIlc=\/0x424:5919x3523\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19888918\/1215765250.jpg.jpg","body_text":"Early Tuesday, March 24th, Barbara Chandler drove from her home in Queens to the Staten Island Amazon warehouse where she\u2019d worked for three years. The streets were emptier than usual. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had ordered all nonessential businesses to close two days before, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state had just passed 20,000. But the warehouse, called JFK8, was busier than ever, deluged with orders from a locked-down populace.\n\nChandler\u2019s co-workers at JFK8 had been getting sick for weeks but none, as far as she knew, with COVID-19. Still, it was unnerving. The day before, she sent home one of her team members after they vomited at their station, visited the in-house medical facility, Amcare, and attempted to continue working. A week earlier, she sent several sick co-workers to Amcare, including one who said her fianc\u00e9 had COVID-19 and whom Chandler never saw again.\n\nChandler, 40, had begun to feel unwell over the weekend, but she\u2019d checked her temperature and wasn\u2019t feverish. Just in case, she\u2019d gone to get a coronavirus test after work the day before. She felt she needed to keep working as she waited for the result. Amazon would give her two weeks of paid leave if she tested positive for COVID-19. But if she was sick with something else, she\u2019d have to take time off without pay. She had three children to support, and she was already starting to feel better.\n\nKey findings Workers at JFK8 raised alarms about sick co-workers in the weeks before COVID-19 cases were confirmed.\n\nAt least 14 workers have tested positive for COVID-19 at JFK8, and workers say the number is far higher.\n\nThough Amazon says it fired a protest organizer for violating quarantine, other workers with greater exposure were never quarantined or notified. The organizer says his quarantine and firing were retaliatory.\n\nFollowing a string of protests, Amazon began providing protective equipment, piloting disinfectant fogging, and implementing other safety measures.\n\nWorkers fear such precautions come too late and want the facility to be closed for cleaning.\n\nA week later, JFK8 would become the first of several Amazon facilities to have workers walk out in protest, calling for the warehouse to be closed and cleaned after workers tested positive for COVID-19. Amazon\u2019s subsequent firing of the organizer intensified the national spotlight and elicited condemnation from unions, promises of a state investigation, and letters from lawmakers. As the largest Amazon facility in the most severe COVID-19 hotspot in the US, the clash at JFK8 serves as a preview of tensions rising throughout Amazon\u2019s fulfillment network. On one side, there\u2019s a company that sees itself as providing a vital service to millions of homebound Americans and is determined to maintain operations amid the crisis. On the other, there are workers who feel increasingly unsafe at their jobs and, as Amazon struggles to staff its warehouses to meet unprecedented demand, newly empowered to push for changes.\n\nAmazon has already made a number of policy changes in response to the pandemic, many of them long-desired by workers. In mid-March, it announced that employees could take unlimited time off without pay (previously, they would be fired for more than taking a certain amount), and they would receive up to two weeks of paid leave if they tested positive for COVID-19 or were placed in quarantine. Later, the company raised pay by $2 per hour, doubled overtime pay, and gave part-time workers paid time off. As the virus spread, Amazon moved warehouse break room tables apart, staggered shifts, canceled stand-up meetings, and made other adjustments to enable greater distance between workers.\n\nAt least 14 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed\n\nBut interviews with 12 JFK8 employees, as well as workers at other warehouses, show the implementation of safety precautions has been uneven. Often, changes are made only after workers exert pressure. Following criticism, Amazon has begun alerting workers when someone at their facility tests positive for COVID-19, but documents obtained by The Verge show notifications still lag by days. While Amazon is giving workers placed in quarantine two weeks of paid leave, some workers who came into contact with diagnosed individuals aren\u2019t being notified. Though Amazon says it fired the JFK8 organizer for violating quarantine, other workers with greater exposure were never contacted.\n\nAfter the JFK8 walkout, Amazon began checking temperatures at the warehouse entrance, enforcing social distancing rules, and piloting fog disinfectant. But workers had been sounding alarms for weeks, and they now fear it\u2019s too late to prevent a major outbreak.\n\nAmazon declined to say how many workers at how many facilities had tested positive for COVID-19, but Jana Jumpp, a worker in an Indiana warehouse, has been collecting alerts sent to workers and counted 314 workers at 111 facilities who have been diagnosed with the virus. JFK8 appears to be a hotspot. At least 14 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, according to alerts viewed by The Verge. Workers believe the true number is closer to 30.\n\nMarch 24th would prove to be a turning point at JFK8. Chandler began work as usual, but two hours into her shift, another assistant manager, Christian Smalls, came over and told her she looked sick \u2014 exhausted, with bloodshot eyes \u2014 and said she should go home. Other colleagues had noticed her appearance as well, but they attributed it to overwork. Smalls, however, had been anxious about the spreading virus for weeks and was on high alert.\n\nSmalls, 31 years old and father of three, had worked at JFK8 since it opened in 2018 and Amazon warehouses in New Jersey and Connecticut before that. It\u2019s a good job, he says, with good benefits, and he hadn\u2019t had any complaints. But in early March, he became concerned about what would happen when the virus reached the warehouse with its 5,000 employees. After some managers flew back from Seattle, at the time the largest hotspot in the US, and one took sick leave, Smalls was alarmed enough to stay away, using his vacation time and eventually tapping his 401k. But now he\u2019d returned, and he\u2019d been pushing management to close the building for cleaning and institute other safety measures. The week before, Smalls and other workers worried about the rising cases of illness at the facility repeatedly went to the manager\u2019s office and said the building should be shut down and cleaned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the pandemic didn\u2019t exist inside the warehouse.\u201d\n\nInstead, Amazon made incremental changes and encouraged workers to maintain social distancing, even if their jobs often made that impossible. (A video of the break room from March 19th shows a crowded cafeteria with workers eating and walking within three feet of each other.) \u201cThey would say, \u2018we don\u2019t have any confirmed cases, we\u2019re following the CDC guidelines,\u2019\u201d Smalls says. \u201cThey kept giving me that excuse, and I said, \u2018yeah, but people are getting sick around me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were just looking sick, and on top of that, we\u2019re hearing about the pandemic on TV, it\u2019s almost like the pandemic didn\u2019t exist inside the warehouse,\u201d says Derrick Palmer, a co-worker who also expressed concerns to management. \u201cThere was no social distancing going on, there was nothing.\u201d\n\nAfter Smalls sent Chandler home, he attended a supervisors\u2019 meeting where he learned that a worker had tested positive for the virus, someone who\u2019d last been in the building on March 11th. Again, he called for the building to be shut down, and again, he was met with resistance. More alarming for Smalls, managers refused to notify all JFK8 workers that someone had tested positive, opting instead to walk the floor and inform select people. The result was that most workers learned of the case when someone posted the news to Facebook later that day or when Vice reported the infection that night. Frustrated, Smalls left the building and went home.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t just sit at home and watch people get sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the last time Amazon got my services,\u201d Smalls says. \u201cAfter that, I came back to the building every single day at seven o\u2019clock in the morning to raise concerns, and I sat in that building for eight hours a day, trying to spread the word, to tell the truth to the people. Since management wanted to keep it a secret, I felt like it was my obligation. I couldn\u2019t just sit at home and watch people get sick.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Smalls returned to JFK8 and went straight to the break room without clocking in. New York had confirmed more than 30,000 coronavirus cases that morning, but in the facility, little had changed. (A video taken the next day, on March 26th, shows the tables had been separated and lines taped on the floor, but workers were still in close proximity.) On the warehouse floor, Smalls and other workers say, employees often worked shoulder to shoulder and shared equipment. For several hours, Smalls told co-workers about the COVID-19 case and gathered a group to visit the general manager\u2019s office, interrupting the morning meeting.\n\nVideo of the visit shows a tense exchange, with workers and managers shouting over each other.\n\n\u201cYou can pass it on to your grandmother, to your kids, what\u2019s the point? For some money?\u201d one worker said. Another demanded to know how many cases there\u2019d been at the facility. \u201cTime is of the essence right now,\u201d one more worker added.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make that decision at the site level whether we close or not,\u201d a manager said. \u201cWe are also following the directions of the CDC. We\u2019re done with this conversation.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the week, Smalls and other workers went back to the manager\u2019s office each morning, and despite the fraught exchange Wednesday, he says JFK8 leadership was generally supportive, telling him when would be a good time for workers to come to express their concerns and thanking him for keeping people calm. But in each instance, leadership would promise to take their concerns up the chain to regional management, and nothing would happen.\n\n\u201cHR just told me that I should keep it quiet.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chandler was at home awaiting her test results. On Thursday morning, she called the urgent care facility and got them: she had the virus. She texted her diagnosis to three supervisors who asked her how she was feeling and said they would escalate her case to human resources and global security. Later, Chandler got a call from HR. \u201cHR just told me that I should keep it quiet,\u201d Chandler says. \u201cThat\u2019s all they told me.\u201d\n\nFour days would pass before workers received an alert about the second case at JFK8, but another worker heard about Chandler\u2019s diagnosis and posted it on Facebook. Besieged with questions, Chandler posted the news herself and texted Smalls, who took the news to the manager\u2019s office and said the dozens of workers Chandler had come in contact with should be quarantined. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh no, we will notify you through the phone or through email,\u2019\u201d Smalls recalls.\n\nTwo days later, on Saturday, Smalls was sitting in the break room talking to workers about the virus when a senior manager took him aside and told him that last Tuesday, he had been in contact with someone who tested positive. They said Smalls should be quarantined and must leave the building, according to Smalls and two other workers present.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson says that the company does not tell workers who they came in contact with out of respect for worker privacy and that it was first made aware that the employee Smalls had contact with tested positive on March 27th. The spokesperson said Amazon began notifying workers immediately and told Smalls verbally on the 28th that he should leave the building and go into quarantine. But because the supervisor told Smalls he had been exposed on Tuesday, the 24th \u2014 when Chandler, the second known case at the facility, was last in the building \u2014 Smalls, Chandler, and other workers surmised that the exposure in question was the moment Smalls sent Chandler home.\n\nChandler and Smalls both say this exchange was brief, about five minutes, and from six feet away. Chandler says she had closer contact with approximately 40 people that day and the preceding day. Yet as far as she knows, none have been quarantined. Palmer, who worked with Chandler, was not put in quarantine and doesn\u2019t know anyone on their team who was. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me that none of these 40 associates had contact with her? That\u2019s impossible,\u201d he says. (Amazon declined to say how many other workers were placed in quarantine in addition to Smalls.)\n\n\u201cChris only got quarantined because he started barking.\u201d\n\nOne worker who was in close contact with Chandler for prolonged periods on the 24th was never placed in quarantine. The worker, who asked to remain anonymous, didn\u2019t learn Chandler had tested positive until the Friday after Chandler got her results when she checked Facebook. Upon seeing Chandler\u2019s post, she contacted her supervisor asking whether she should quarantine and was told HR would be calling people shortly, according to screenshots viewed by The Verge. She never received a call. On Saturday, she messaged her supervisor again and was told someone would talk to workers during her shift the next day. But on Sunday, when the worker returned to JFK8, the supervisor on duty seemed not to know about the incident and later told her that the safety team had analyzed video and quarantined anyone who had had close contact with Chandler for more than 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cChris only got quarantined because he started barking,\u201d the worker said. \u201cI had more contact with Barbara, Chris had about five minutes with her, I had almost a whole morning. And they told me absolutely nothing until I spoke to [a supervisor] and said, \u2018are we going to mention this? What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was retaliation,\u201d Smalls says. \u201cIt was an attempt to silence me.\u201d\n\nAfter being ejected from the building, Smalls decided to organize the walkout. He contacted other workers he\u2019d spoken to in the break room and formed an Instagram group chat. They posted on Facebook and printed out flyers, which workers left in restrooms at JFK8 the next day. \u201cWe had 24 hours to do it,\u201d Smalls says. \u201cI ran to CVS. I spent $100 on signs and posters. I was on go. I didn\u2019t sleep that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an attempt to silence me.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, workers at JFK8 received a text alert: a new COVID-19 case at the facility had been confirmed, last in the building on March 24th. This, Chandler says, was her. Four days had elapsed since she told supervisors she tested positive.\n\nAround noon, workers walked out. Organizers say 60 employees protested, while Amazon put the number at 15. Many wore homemade masks or bandanas over their faces and carried signs calling for the building to be shut down and cleaned. Smalls returned to the facility for the first time since his expulsion and stood with protesters in the parking lot, addressing reporters.\n\nWhen he got home, Smalls received a call from the same supervisor who placed him in quarantine, saying he had violated the directive by returning to JFK8 and was fired. In a statement, Amazon later said it did not fire Smalls for organizing the protest, but for \u201cputting the health and safety of others at risk\u201d by coming back to the facility after being placed in quarantine.\n\nThe firing brought Smalls a far larger audience than the walkout ever would have. Unions and elected officials issued statements calling for his reinstatement. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights to investigate his firing. Smalls gave interview after interview and appeared on MSNBC the next night. Minutes after the segment ended, JFK8 workers received an alert: three new cases at the facility.\n\nThroughout the furor, Amazon struck a righteous tone, claiming that Smalls was the real threat to worker safety, and his firing shows how seriously the company is taking the virus. \u201cI\u2019m confused. Thought you wanted us to protect our workers?\u201d Amazon public relations head Jay Carney tweeted at Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday. \u201cMr. Smalls purposely violated social distancing rules, repeatedly, & was put on Paid 14-day quarantine for COVID exposure. 3\/30 he returned to the site. Knowingly putting our team at risk is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer\u2019s conduct was immoral.\u201d\n\nThis turned out to be a strategy developed at the highest levels of the company. Vice later obtained notes from a meeting attended by Jeff Bezos in which Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky called Smalls \u201cnot smart or articulate\u201d and discussed plans to make him \u201cthe face of the entire union\/organizing movement.\u201d (Workers began a unionization effort at JFK8 shortly after it opened, though Smalls says he was not involved.) \u201cWe should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer\u2019s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal, in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety,\u201d Zapolsky wrote.\n\nAfter the memo leaked, Smalls gave yet another round of interviews. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to silence me from the beginning,\u201d Smalls says. \u201cAll I was doing was trying to help people in my building, but somehow my life changed in 24 hours, so I\u2019m still trying to cope with this.\u201d He\u2019s been barraged with messages from Amazon workers around the world. \u201cI got the weight of the world on my shoulders as far as the retail industry goes. I\u2019ve got every person at Amazon from all over the world calling and texting me. They\u2019re supportive, and it makes me feel good to know that I\u2019m giving them a voice, but at the same time we need to take action. Everybody\u2019s reaching out to me, I\u2019m like, yeah, you know what you do, you walk the hell out of your buildings.\u201d\n\nBut Smalls\u2019 firing also had a dampening effect on worker activism. Multiple workers at JFK8 and other Amazon facilities say they share his concerns and would support a walkout, but that after his firing, they are afraid to risk their jobs. Worried about their health but reluctant to protest, they decided to stay home without pay and hope the pandemic receded soon. When workers at JFK8 walked out a second time this Monday, only 10 or so protested. Others posted messages of support online from the safety of their homes.\n\nSince the first walkout, workers at JFK8 have received near daily alerts about new coronavirus cases. The alerts don\u2019t specify a number, saying only that \u201cmultiple\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d new cases have been confirmed. Amazon declined to give a total. Assuming each alert represents only two cases, there have been at least 14, and workers estimate there to be twice as many.\n\nAmazon has been publicly dismissive of worker actions at JFK8 and elsewhere, calling their claims \u201csimply unfounded\u201d and saying it has taken \u201cextreme measures\u201d to ensure employee safety. But in the aftermath of the protests, the company has instituted new safety precautions at a rapid clip. Days after the walkout at JFK8 and similar protests in Chicago and Detroit, Amazon announced it would install temperature readers at its warehouses and anyone with a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit would be sent home. Workers greeted it as a positive step, though it wouldn\u2019t have caught someone like Chandler who never ran a fever. After criticism for sending feverish but undiagnosed workers home without pay, Amazon started offering partial pay. At JFK8 and elsewhere, workers now get masks at the beginning of their shift. The company also told workers it would institute \u201cmandatory social distancing,\u201d potentially firing workers who \u201cintentionally violate\u201d the guidelines. (A worker who received a writeup at JFK8 said her job still required being in close proximity and worried she\u2019d be fired for unavoidable violations.) This week, Amazon began piloting \u201cdisinfectant fogging\u201d at JFK8 and announced plans to begin producing its own diagnostic tests for workers.\n\n\u201cThe only reason they\u2019re doing this stuff is because we blasted them in the media.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Amazon said it has been implementing new safety measures over the past several weeks and will continue to do so. \u201cThe health and safety of our employees is our top priority,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said. \u201cSince the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and local health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates and teams.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere they slow? Yeah, definitely,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cThe only reason they\u2019re doing this stuff is because we blasted them in the media.\u201d\n\nBut workers fear the measures arrived too late to avert a major outbreak, and five of the 12 workers The Verge spoke with had decided to stay home without pay, either out of fear of infecting vulnerable family members or concerns for their own safety. \u201cI need the paycheck, I have bills to pay,\u201d said one worker. But she has asthma and lives with her grandmother, and one day in the break room became overwhelmed with anxiety and never came back. Another worker grew alarmed by the repeated alerts about new cases and stopped coming in. \u201cI can\u2019t afford not to be there, but by the same token, I can\u2019t afford to get the virus,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave\n\nChandler is still recovering and has developed a cough. She hopes she can return to work soon. She\u2019s exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave and is now getting only 60 percent of her pay. (Amazon says employees who exhaust their COVID-19 sick leave are eligible for short-term disability, which pays 60 percent of their salary.)\n\nShe believes she got the virus at the warehouse. She only goes outside to drive to work and back, and she\u2019s in such frequent contact with her co-workers. Chandler wishes Amazon had acted sooner and thinks it\u2019s now too late to safely operate the warehouse without shutting it down and testing everyone before reopening. \u201cThey should have notified everyone with the first case,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they should have closed the building for deep cleaning.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":301,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/13\/21219283\/racism-coronavirus-covid-19-african-americans","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-13","author":"['Rabbi Seth Limmer']","title":"Racism and coronavirus double the damage inflicted upon African Americans","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/Wmys-cuh6XnjJLe1vxT6TtaG-os=\/0x288:4013x2389\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19896125\/Virus_Outbreak_Race.jpg","body_text":"Today we are all sheltering in place. To defeat a lethal enemy, we sacrifice freedoms, limit contact with others, surrender financial security, and restrict ourselves from things we would like to be doing, in service of the greater good of saving lives.\n\nIt strikes me that the same thing was happening around this time 57 years ago.\n\nOpinion\n\nOn April 16, 1963 (Good Friday that year), 50 courageous individuals chose to be commanded by the government to remain in place; they did so to combat a pernicious, nation-ravaging evil that had taken countless lives and seemingly knew no borders. Led by Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth and Ralph Albernathy, these peaceful protest marchers were incarcerated by Bull Connor. They intentionally remained in jail, eschewing bond, to combat the deathly evil of racism.\n\nFrom that very Birmingham Jail, Dr. King would pen his rightly famous letter. He challenged us to pay attention to what his moment made clear, bringing to the surface the problems already present.\n\n\u201cWe bring [racism] out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. \u2026 Injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.\u201d\n\nDr. King taught us that racism must be exposed. In the age of COVID-19, racism certainly has been exposed as a stubbornly infectious and lethal American virus. Racism is combining with the coronavirus to double the damage inflicted upon African Americans.\n\nWe learned last week that people of color are dying disproportionately of the novel coronavirus. While some sing the chorus \u201cthe virus knows no color\u201d, African Americans are dying of the disease at alarming rates: people of color constitute 42% of COVID fatalities, but only 21% of the national population. Here in Chicago, the statistics are more stark: 70% of coronavirus deaths have found victims in our African American community.\n\nThe injustice has been exposed is that both COVID-19 and racism are killing the black community in Chicago and throughout America. This is not the bias of petty personal prejudice, but racism entrenched in American institutions: the legacy of intentional racist policies that led to tragic disproportions in housing, educational opportunities, food availability, employment prospects, and wealth generation.\n\nRacism kills. It killed through the master\u2019s whip. It killed through lynchings. It killed through the KKK. It kills through mass incarceration, with Cook County Jail serving as the worst current example. But racism also kills through the continuing effects of centuries of American policy that are every bit as lethal.\n\nYes, we are seeing death by COVID-19. But we are also witnessing death by racism. And through our history, racism has a much higher and even more tragic body count.\n\nFifthy-seven years ago, Dr. King did more than shelter-in-place to combat racism; he went to jail.\n\nI imagine Dr. King might be encouraged to see all we are sacrificing to counter COVID-19.

Other measures focus on \u201csocial distancing\u201d and prohibiting meetings, sports events and other public gatherings.\n\nOpinion\n\nDespite our best preventive health measures, thousands of people are expected to be hospitalized. This will be expensive.\n\nProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute have recently released a fascinating analysis of U.S. national, regional and municipal hospital capacity and how it relates to COVID-19.\n\nThe report looks at U.S. hospital capacity under various scenarios. The report asks what would happen to an area\u2019s hospital capacity if 20%, 40% or 60% of an area\u2019s population were infected with COVID-19 over a six-month, 12-month or 18-month interval.\n\nFor example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, according to this model. However, if 20% of Chicago\u2019s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would not be reached.\n\nMany of those who have been infected with COVID-19 will be admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and will require support with mechanical ventilators.\n\nThe health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment\n\nA majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.\n\nMany of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the approximately 28 million Americans who had no health insurance prior to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIt has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.\n\nA potential solution\n\nThe Trump administration has recently stated that it would help hospitals by providing coverage for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those uninsured Americans.\n\nWhile the Trump administration\u2019s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to help uninsured patients who have other health issues requiring hospitalization. Here are a couple of suggestions to fix things:\n\n\u2022 Consider lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years. This would help those working people who are not old enough to have Medicare eligibility, which begins at age 65.\n\n\u2022 Relax the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. This can be done through an 1115 waiver. This provision allows a state to request additional funding and flexibility in determining eligibility in providing care to those who qualify for Medicaid. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has applied for a such a waiver for Illinois.\n\nBoth these steps will help us be better prepared for health care in the COVID-19 era . . . and the post-COVID-19 era.\n\nWe need to pressure the Congress and the Trump administration to address the long-term issue of health care and the uninsured by expanding eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nDr. Alan Jackson is an assistant professor of medicine and public voices fellow at Rush University.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":308,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2020\/04\/13\/833412729\/how-long-does-it-take-to-recover-from-covid-19-and-how-long-are-you-infectious","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-04-13","author":"['Allison Aubrey']","title":"How Long Does It Take To Recover From COVID-19?","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/04\/13\/gettyimages-1211588943_wide-5416f049267d8d7162c7c05316dc7a986b975298.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"How Long Does It Take To Recover From COVID-19?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Paget\/Getty Images Justin Paget\/Getty Images\n\nAround the world, COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to grow each day. Yet, there are also more than 440,000 people globally who have recovered to date.\n\nFor those who have had the illness, recovery can be a slow journey. And even after you're feeling better, there can be a period of uncertainty. After days or weeks of isolation, you may be eager to see family again and even step foot into the outer world. But how soon is too soon? And how do you know when you're no longer infectious?\n\nFor answers, we've turned to several experts, including two doctors who both got diagnosed with COVID-19 in mid-March and have since recovered. Rosny Daniel, 32, an emergency department doctor at the University of California, San Francisco, is back on the job and feeling \"completely back to normal.\" And Darren Klugman, 45, a pediatric cardiologist, says he's feeling \"100%\" and is also back to work after isolating himself away from his family.\n\nKlugman says the news of the rising COVID-19 deaths is heartbreaking and sobering. He says it points to the critical need for pandemic planning. But he says it's almost as important to realize how many people are recovering. \"The majority of people will have a mild-to-moderate flu-like illness like I had,\" Klugman says.\n\nHe says that it's critical for everyone to follow social distancing guidelines and that if you do suspect you may be sick \u2014 whether or not you have tested positive \u2014 take action to protect yourself and those around you. \"Most important is recognizing the symptoms early, isolating oneself and really strictly abiding by the quarantine rules,\" Klugman says.\n\nAm I well yet? What to watch for if you think you're getting well.\n\nDaniel says people who get COVID-19 can have a wide range of symptoms and the severity of the sickness can range a great deal from person to person. \"It's incredibly confusing, and there is a big amount of unpredictability to it,\" he says.\n\nBut keep an eye out if you think you're better after a few days, because you may still get worse. Daniel says for the first few days of his illness he had aches and chills. He developed a fever and a mild cough and felt wiped out, tired. \"My muscles hurt really bad in my legs. I felt really sore,\" he says. \"[It was] painful to the point that they felt like they were tingling.\"\n\nHe started to feel better, but then, on day seven, the symptoms came back and he started to also have trouble breathing.\n\nHe has mild asthma and Type 1 diabetes, two underlying conditions linked to an increased risk of serious illness. He began using his inhalers to treat the asthma. He also took an antibiotic to treat what may have been a secondary bacterial infection in his lung. After several days, he felt much better.\n\nKlugman says he felt sick for about 10 days. At first he had \"intermittent chills and body aches,\" and then he developed a low fever and a \"very prominent cough.\" Based on these symptoms, he quarantined himself away from his family for 14 days, before he even got the positive COVID-19 test results.\n\n\"By day 10, I was feeling my energy level was near normal,\" Klugman says, but he says his cough persisted for a while longer. Now, he says, he's completely recovered and even back to going running.\n\nAs a doctor, Daniel says, he's really eager to see more testing and better data on COVID-19: \"Right now it feels a little bit like we are fighting with a blindfold on. We're trying to get as much information as possible.\"\n\nWhat are the guidelines for when you can stop isolating yourself after you've been sick?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance saying people with COVID-19 can stop isolating themselves when they've been fever free for 72 hours \u2014 that's three days after the fever ends. And to note: That is without the use of fever-reducing medicine. This should accompany an improvement in respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, and should be at least seven days from the onset of initial symptoms.\n\nThe CDC says testing can also inform the decision. But the test-based strategy that the CDC suggests involves getting negative results on two tests, with samples collected at least 24 hours apart. Given the difficulties with testing, that may not be realistic for most people right now.\n\nAfter self-isolation, recovered patients who are returning to work and public spaces should still follow the mitigation recommendations for everyone, such as avoiding groups and washing hands. Right now, most people are under stay-at-home orders, so trips outside may be limited anyway.\n\nFor health care workers, some institutions have put in place additional guidance building on the CDC's.\n\nDaniel was off work for nearly three weeks. His hospital used a specific process to clear him back to work. \"The guideline we're using is 14 days past initial symptoms, plus 72 hours of no symptoms,\" Daniel told us.\n\nIt's worth noting that the CDC says this is all based on limited information \u2014 so this guidance could change as it learns more.\n\nGiven that some people's symptoms reoccur at day seven, as Daniel's did, he says there's reason to be cautious. To be conservative, you might want to wait a couple of extra days before leaving self-isolation, in case you regress.\n\nWhat does the science say about how long people may stay contagious after they've recovered?\n\nIt's not fully known how long a person with COVID-19 is infectious. \"A rough guide for other infections is that infectiousness drops when the fever subsides,\" says Ben Cowling, a professor of public health at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAaron Carroll, a professor of medicine at Indiana University, says there's still some uncertainty. \"We still don't have enough data to really know how long people are infectious,\" he says.\n\nAnd he says some doctors are concerned about the CDC's guidelines. \"I will tell you that I think a lot of people I know are uncomfortable with that guidance. They think that it may not be as conservative as it needs to be,\" Carroll says.\n\nCowling says studies are underway to evaluate how long the body continues to shed the virus after someone starts to get better. But, he adds, there is not a direct link between shedding and infectiousness.\n\nOne meta-study looking at over 100 cases found RNA from the virus in stool samples up to 33 days after onset of the illness, even after the patients had tested negative using samples from their respiratory tracts. But the researchers noted that they didn't know if these were only RNA fragments or active virus particles that could infect someone.\n\nI feel well and back to normal. When can I see my older family members again?\n\nA lot of people who feel better would like to reconnect with family members \u2014 perhaps with elderly parents. But that's not safe yet, says Sean Morrison, a geriatrician and palliative care specialist at the Mount Sinai Health System.\n\nOlder people are more vulnerable to COVID-19, and 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been among adults who were at least 65 years old, according to the CDC.\n\n\"What I strongly recommend is that in-person visits to older family members remain only if needed and, at that, infrequent,\" Morrison says. To provide things like groceries and medications, some visits may be necessary, but they should be limited as much as possible. \"Particularly for older adults, the strong isolation and physical distancing required is really hard,\" he adds. \"And yet it is what is going to get us through this.\"\n\nWill I be immune to reinfection after I've had COVID-19, or could I get it again?\n\nThe CDC says the full immune response, including duration of immunity, is not yet fully understood. So, there's some uncertainty.\n\n\"I hope that my antibodies are all ramped up and I'm protected from getting sick again, but I don't know that for sure,\" Daniel says. \"So I'm treating it as if I don't have immunity, and I wear full protection at all times, by our hospital's guidelines, to make sure I'm still protecting myself.\"\n\nSo far, there's almost no data, and no long-term data, on the virus that causes COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV-2), so it's speculative to say how long immunity may last after being infected.\n\n\"Based on immunity to SARS [and] MERS, and seasonal coronaviruses, a reasonable expectation is that most, and maybe nearly all, people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have immunity for a year or more,\" says Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. This immunity will likely protect people \"at least against severe disease and against shedding a lot of virus that would make them highly contagious,\" Lipsitch says.\n\nHe says this best guess is informed by what scientists documented in the blood of people who had recovered from SARS and MERS, which also are caused by coronaviruses. Lipsitch says these studies suggest that the people's defenses against the viruses seemed to last a while, about two years for SARS and, for MERS, nearly three years.\n\nLipsitch says more research is needed to determine how long people are protected after COVID-19. \"We need to design studies where individuals with known COVID-19 infection and without infection are followed over time to assess whether the first group is protected, or partially protected, against COVID-19 infection compared to the second group,\" Lipsitch says. He says these studies are challenging to design, but he and some colleagues are currently trying to do so.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":312,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/13\/21220045\/19-immigrant-children-chicago-detainee-shelter-tested-positive-covid-19","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-13","author":"['Melissa Sanchez', 'Propublica Illinois']","title":"At least 19 immigrant children at Chicago detainee shelter tested positive for COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/gfvrQP9I43wv_YvyOmhEmXysX28=\/0x55:645x393\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19896933\/Screen_Shot_2020_04_13_at_7.02.18_PM.png","body_text":"This article is copublished with ProPublica Illinois, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.\n\nAt least 19 children and two employees at a Chicago shelter for immigrant youth have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, in what appears to be the largest outbreak of the virus in the country in shelters for unaccompanied minors.\n\nAccording to an email sent to staff Sunday, Heartland Human Care Services officials said the first positive test results were reported at its Bronzeville shelter on Friday and that additional cases there were confirmed over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday, officials from Heartland Alliance, the umbrella nonprofit organization that oversees the shelter program, confirmed the positive tests and said they expect there will be more cases.\n\n\u201cWe are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption,\u201d Mailee Garcia, a spokeswoman for the organization, wrote in a statement. \u201cThe prognosis for all of the children in our care is very good, and we are continuing to focus on our participants\u2019 health and well-being.\u201d\n\nAs of last Wednesday, only six COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among children and adolescents housed in shelters around the country, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the nation\u2019s shelter program. All six were at shelters in New York.\n\nORR officials said there were also 39 \u201cself-reports\u201d of positive COVID-19 tests among personnel affiliated with shelter programs in six states as of Wednesday. ORR has not provided updated figures, despite repeated requests since Friday.\n\nCOVID-19 is a less serious health threat to children than it is to adults.\n\nHeartland, according to the copies of the email obtained by ProPublica Illinois, began \u201ctrying to secure tests\u201d for children at the Bronzeville shelter after some of them displayed \u201cCOVID-19-like symptoms,\u201d wrote David Sinski, executive director of Heartland Human Care Services.\n\nThe email doesn\u2019t detail symptoms, when they became evident or when children were tested. But by Friday, Heartland officials learned that one of its \u201cparticipants\u201d \u2014 as the immigrant children and youth are called \u2014 had tested positive.\n\nOn Saturday, officials were told that three additional children had tested positive. By Sunday morning, they received positive COVID-19 diagnoses for an additional 15 children, bringing the total to 19. According to the email, 10 of the 19 children are asymptomatic. Two staff members have also tested positive.\n\n\u201cWe understand that receiving this news may leave you feeling uncertain and scared,\u201d Sinski wrote to staff. \u201cI want you to know that we are committed to providing you with the information that you need to know in order to keep you and your loved ones healthy and safe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how old the infected children are or where they are from. But the Bronzeville shelter, a four-story converted nursing home that can hold up to 250 boys and girls, is licensed to house children from infancy to 17 years old.\n\nOfficials said they \u201cimmediately\u201d move children to an isolated environment when they show any signs of any illness, including COVID-19, to minimize any risk of community spread. Since Saturday, Heartland has \u201cenhanced our social distancing measures\u201d at the shelters to limit the contact among children and between children and staff, Garcia said.\n\nIn his email, Sinski wrote that all remaining children at the facility are being tested and that he expected those results by Tuesday. He also asked all employees who worked on the floors where children who tested positive were living to stay home with pay for two weeks. Staff members who undertake \u201cspecific activities\u201d with children will be provided N95 masks, gowns and gloves, and are being screened for COVID-19 symptoms before each shift.\n\nHeartland officials said they are now contracting with additional nurse practitioners to be at the shelter for every shift. They are also exploring a house parent model, which would have a subset of staff be onsite full time for the coming couple of weeks, officials said.\n\nHeartland officials said the organization is in close contact with ORR and city public health officials.\n\nShelters for immigrant children, nursing homes and other congregate facilities must report to the city of Chicago when there are two or more positive COVID-19 cases, according to a March order. The city\u2019s Health Department then provides \u201ctailored guidance to facility staff on infection control, including cleaning protocols and how to properly manage both COVID-19 positive and exposed individuals,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement, adding that clusters of cases have been identified in \u201cseveral facilities.\u201d\n\nGarcia said the organization is \u201cdoing all that we can to advocate for additional testing kits for participants and staff across our programs.\u201d She added that \u201cour team have been stellar and courageous champions during this pandemic, committed to both a high level of quality care and being creative and supportive to each other during this challenging time. They are true heroes.\u201d\n\nThe Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, which licenses the shelters, has been notified that children at the facility tested positive. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact, and we\u2019re offering assistance,\u201d said agency spokesman Jassen Strokosch.\n\nHeartland officials said a professional cleaning company has performed multiple cleanings of the facility in the past week and will continue to perform weekly deep cleanings.\n\nAccording to ORR guidance meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, children who have symptoms and are recommended for testing are isolated from other children pending test results. Shelter programs are required to do twice-daily temperature checks of immigrant children and alert ORR if a child has a temperature above 100 degrees. ORR has also implemented a mandatory temperature check for anyone entering a shelter, according to officials.\n\nORR has also stopped placing children at shelters in California, New York and Washington, with limited exceptions, and said it is trying to find local shelters for newly arrived immigrant children to limit air travel. Previously, children were moved to shelters around the country where beds were available.\n\nAbout 2,800 children are being held in the nation\u2019s shelter system. There are 69 children at three shelters run by Heartland. The organization previously operated five shelters, all in Chicago, but has consolidated the program in response to COVID-19. \u201cOur census was lower and consolidating sites has allowed us to implement the measures . . . to safeguard the health of our staff and participants,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nNo children have tested positive for COVID-19 at another group of shelters in Illinois run by Maryville Academy, a Catholic child welfare agency, said Sister Catherine Ryan, Maryville\u2019s executive director. About 30 teens are currently housed at two Maryville shelters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that all of our children are fine,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cObviously, we are taking a lot of precautions to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nLawyers and advocates for detained immigrant children say they\u2019ve been worried an outbreak would occur in a shelter. Lawyers went to court in late March to ask the federal government to speed up the release of children in its custody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been our concern all along as advocates that jails, prisons, detention facilities, even licensed shelter detention, it\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see the massive outbreaks and it\u2019s going to be exponentially higher than in the broader community,\u201d said Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.\n\nCooper said she is particularly worried about children who have preexisting conditions that have not been identified by shelter officials or ORR and will make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe goal,\u201d she said, \u201cis to get kids out of congregate care because there\u2019s no way it can comply with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance even if you\u2019re using all the hand sanitizer in the world.\u201d\n\nMelissa Sanchez is a reporter at ProPublica Illinois who focuses on immigrants and low-wage workers.

Michael Rodriguez (22nd) said when he was notified of the permit three days later, he asked the city health department if the company had met all requirements.\n\n\u201cI inquired with the city if they were allowed to do this work, and the city said yes,\u201d he said.\n\nRodriguez said he later asked the health department if the work could be postponed because Hilco had delivered paper notices to some residents only a day before the demolition. The city still gave the go-ahead, Rodriguez said.\n\nGiven the late notice to residents, \u201cI did inquire with the city whether putting a pause on the job was an option, and I was told it wasn\u2019t an option, that they had a right to do that work,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cSomething obviously went terribly wrong.\u201d\n\nMaryland-based Controlled Demolition was hired to demolish the smokestack.\n\n\u201cPer our contract, any communication involving any of the job goes through Hilco,\u201d said one employee reached over the phone.\n\nAttorney Frank Avila Jr., who plans to sue on behalf of Little Village residents, likened the scene in Little Village to Chernobyl.\n\nLightfoot bristled, calling it a \u201creally poor choice of words\u201d to compare it to the Russian nuclear power plant disaster.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the hyperbole, but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate in this time,\u201d she said.\n\nLightfoot was asked whether she would support a City Council vote rescinding a $19.7 million subsidy granted to Hilco for its warehouse project on the site.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any basis for our taking that kind of action. But we\u2019re reviewing everything,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the city and Hilco try to mitigate the damage, some nearby residents feel despondent.\n\nKathryn Ramirez-Mercado, 32, who lives about half a mile from the old power plant, said she heard about the planned demolition Saturday morning through the news.\n\n\u201cMy wife went outside that morning and saw the paper left on the floor. I didn\u2019t realize that they\u2019d only given us a day\u2019s notice,\u201d she said.\n\nRamirez-Mercado said many of her neighbors are young children and elderly residents with underlying health conditions.\n\n\u201cThere are so many kids on our block and so many old generations,\u201d Ramirez-Mercado said. \u201cAs a resident, it makes me feel like we\u2019re insignificant, we\u2019re voiceless and powerless throughout this process.\u201d\n\nContributing: Tyler LaRiviere\n\nCarlos Ballesteros is a corps member of Report for America, a not-for-profit journalism program that aims to bolster Sun-Times coverage of Chicago\u2019s South Side and West Side.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":322,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/politics\/2020\/4\/14\/21221247\/democrats-meeting-jeff-tobolski-successor-essential-business-covid19-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-14","author":"['Rachel Hinton']","title":"Do Democratic leaders consider meeting to name Tobolski successor essential business?","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/POUD7VtCUEpgYb2sW_Lr48AwMdI=\/0x0:5582x2923\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19898831\/merlin_88565971.jpg","body_text":"The meeting to choose a successor to embattled former Cook County Commissioner Jeff Tobolski could prove a challenge to social distancing requirements.\n\nAs many as ten contenders are hoping to present their credentials to the eight-member panel of Democratic Party leaders planning to meet in Berwyn on Wednesday to make the decision.\n\nOrganizers did not respond to requests for comment about their rationale for holding the meeting while the state is under Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s stay-at-home order.\n\nBut Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough, who doubles as Democratic committeeperson for Proviso Township, said candidates seeking the appointment will come before the committee one by one and the party leaders will be six feet apart.\n\nEarlier in the day, the entire 80-member Cook County Democratic Party is planning to hold its convention to elect party officers online rather than in person.\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over five weeks since Tobolski announced he was giving up his Cook County commissioner seat, and in that time the field of would-be successors has swelled, inching closer to the size of the entire 17-member County Board itself.\n\nThat could complicate the work of the committee that plans to make the appointment Wednesday at a special meeting of Democratic leaders.\n\nSince Tobolski announced his resignation March 6, the field of potential replacements has ballooned from four, to six and now to possibly as many as 10 candidates, said Yarbrough, who is on the committee to pick Tobolski\u2019s replacement in her role as Democratic Proviso Township committeeperson.\n\n\u201cIt seems like everybody involved has someone [from their area] who\u2019s interested in this seat,\u201d Yarbrough said.\n\nIncluding Yarbrough.\n\nThe clerk and longtime committeeperson said she was waiting to connect with a candidate from her area who works for the Cook County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.\n\nIn addition to Yarbrough, the committee to pick Tobolski\u2019s replacement includes Ald. Ed Burke (14th); Berwyn Mayor Robert Lovero, who has the largest weighted vote; Blanca Vargas of Cicero; Barrett Pederson of Leyden Township; Bridgeview Mayor and state Sen. Steven Landek of Lyons Township; state Rep. Michael Zalewski of Riverside Township, and Vincent Cainkar of Stickney Township.\n\nThe eight-member group, all members of the Cook County Democratic Party, are scheduled to meet Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Italian-American Civic Organization of Berwyn. To be appointed, the candidate will need the weighted equivalent of 27,162 votes out of a possible 54,322.\n\nAmong the names of people said to be eyeing the position are Cicero realtor Eduardo Garcia, who founded Realty of Chicago in Berwyn; Victor Burgos, who works as an operating engineer in the county\u2019s Department of Facilities Management; Mike Porfirio, the clerk of Lyons Township, and Frank Aguilar, a former Republican state representative elected to represent Cicero and Berwyn.\n\nBurgos and Aguilar didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPorfirio pointed to his background and government experience in Lyons, Bridgeview and Summit to explain why he\u2019d be \u201can effective commissioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the area well, and I think I would be able to represent the people very effectively,\u201d Porfirio said. \u201cI have a good pulse of what\u2019s going on, and my experience would help me be a good public servant and steward to people.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the job Tobolski did, Porfirio said the former commissioner was \u201cvisible\u201d in the community but, with the cloud of a federal investigation looming over him, people want someone to \u201crestore their faith and trust in government and public servants and I think we owe that to people \u2014 we owe it to people to be morally and ethically responsible.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tobolski, who was first elected in 2010, resigned from both the County Board and his position as McCook village president effective March 31, according to the letters obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nThat move was sparked by the September search of Tobolski\u2019s McCook Village Hall offices, although he gave no reason given for either of the resignations.\n\nThat raid was part of a suburban squeeze that came days after federal agents raided the home and offices of former Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval. A source told the Chicago Sun-Times the raids were related.\n\nAfter the raid, the former commissioner missed a string of County Board and Forest Preserve meetings \u2014 he blamed health issues for missing those meetings and said at a December Forest Preserve meeting that he was still under a doctor\u2019s care but \u201c... it\u2019s my picking or choosing as to how I feel, and I\u2019m back today.\u201d\n\nPat Doherty, Tobolski\u2019s chief of staff, was indicted in February on three bribery charges.\n\nFor Garcia, who is also vying for the appointment, the opportunity is one that could help balance the scales of diversity on the board. Since the county is more than 30% Hispanic, at least four Latinos should hold seats on the board, Garcia said.\n\nHe also hopes to educate people in the community about what a commissioner does and to bring resources to all parts of the district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be a part-time commissioner \u2014 anything I\u2019ve done in my life, I\u2019ve given it 150%,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe need someone at the table in Cook County to voice our concerns.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":325,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/blackhawks\/2020\/4\/15\/21222890\/blackhawks-convention-2020-canceled-coronavirus-chicago-nhl-hockey","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-15","author":"['Ben Pope']","title":"Blackhawks cancel 2020 fan convention because of coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/h3G8oJnAelCdhQmZmlfz_c_rLjc=\/0x0:7027x3679\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19901234\/Blackhawks_Convention_Hockey.jpg","body_text":"The coronavirus pandemic has nixed the Blackhawks Convention more than three months before the scheduled event.\n\nThe Hawks canceled the 13th edition of the event \u2014 slated for July 24-26 \u2014 on Wednesday, citing the uncertain status of the rest of the 2019-20 NHL season and the advice of public-health officials. Full refunds for previously purchased convention passes and hotel rooms will be issued.\n\nThe 2019 convention drew thousands of fans to downtown Chicago for autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, new-player introductions, alumni and front-office panels and numerous other types of programming. It spanned from Friday night through Sunday afternoon, just as this edition was supposed to do.\n\nIllinois\u2019 ban on large gatherings \u2014 although it doesn\u2019t extend anywhere near late July yet \u2014 theoretically would make the convention impossible. And even if the ban were to be lifted by then, many fans might be reluctant to attend, given the close proximity they would have with thousands of others, leading to attendance concerns.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance the NHL season will resume around that point of the summer, although a plethora of obstacles would lie in the way of that.\n\nIf the season does resume, the most likely way would seem to be in a single, neutral-site city, ideally one with relatively few coronavirus cases but with infrastructure sufficient enough to house thousands of players, coaches, league officials, TV crews and more. Even still, the games almost certainly would be held in empty arenas.\n\nSo far, cities reportedly under consideration are Grand Forks, North Dakota; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota\u2019s hockey facilities. Manchester\u2019s SNHU Arena is the former home of a Kings minor-league affiliate. Saskatoon\u2019s spacious SaskTel Centre typically hosts the Blades of the Western Hockey League.\n\nBut the NHL is far away from making any serious commitments to such sites, and little is known about what the format the end of the season would look like. Unless the regular season was resumed or the playoff field was expanded, the Hawks wouldn\u2019t take part.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":341,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/16\/21224358\/sports-wrigley-field-united-center-covid-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-16","author":"['John Silver']","title":"When will it be safe for fans to return to Wrigley Field, United Center?","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/ySe7dKZsYAh0wxAHLI18cZDy_5E=\/0x169:3000x1740\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19907493\/1215003284.jpg","body_text":"With most of the country under a shelter-in-place order and professional sports leagues having come to a halt, many have wondered when it will be safe for those leagues to restart and fans to return.\n\nOddsmakers and statisticians from Sports Betting Dime have run projections of the likelihood that a fan would be infected by an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19 while attending a sporting event. The projections are broken down by city, and factor in each city\u2019s projected COVID-19 peak date \u2014 for Illinois that is April 17 \u2014 along with various presumptive league start dates.\n\nThey looked at nine cities, including Chicago, that have MLB, NBA and NHL franchises and how the probability of infection would change based on different league dates of June 1, June 15 or July 1.\n\nThe study assumes continued social distancing measures throughout the summer and further assumes standard game behavior by fans and uses the average crowd size from the previous season for each venue.\n\nThe numbers were similar among the three leagues, but they don\u2019t look encouraging for sports fans looking to get back into a stadium anytime soon.\n\nIf Major League Baseball opens on June 1 at Wrigley Field (assuming an average attendance of 38,208), 818 people \u2014 or 2.16% \u2014 would be infected with the coronavirus. With a June 15 start date, that number drops to 204 infections (0.54%), but if MLB were to begin on July 1, there would be 92 people infections (0.24%).\n\nIf the NBA or NHL restarted at the United Center with an average attendance of 18,804, there would be 395 people infected (2.12%) with a June 1 restart date. If they begin on June 15, 99 people would be infected (0.53%) and July 1 would yield 44 infections (0.24%).\n\nNationwide the numbers vary according to the projected peak date of the virus. The projections put Chicago on the lower end of infection rates, with an 88% drop from 2.16% to 0.24% probability of infection if the start date is pushed back from June 1 to July 1. Boston and New York have a projected peak date one day sooner than Chicago on April 16. Their infection rate starts at roughly 0.54% for June 1 and drops to 0.05% on July 1. Miami doesn\u2019t peak until May 2 and therefore their infection rate at an NBA or NHL game is 29.17% for a June 1 start, dropping to 13.82% with start on July 1.\n\nEven with the later July 1 start date and a relatively low infection rate projected for Chicago, the exponentially increasing nature of the virus still means that each newly infected person will contribute to a swift inflation of the curve. Until we have more effective measures in place to combat the coronavirus, fans are a long way away from being able to safely watch sports in a stadium or an arena.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":342,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/16\/21221958\/coronavirus-treatment-data-hydroxychloroquine-trump-remdesivir","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-16","author":"['Nicole Wetsman']","title":"The search for COVID-19 treatments shows how messy science can be","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/Nee26xcc218pc9PS5E5fo3Atlt0=\/0x354:5908x3447\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19902353\/1209704401.jpg.jpg","body_text":"There\u2019s yet another new study out this week on hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug championed by President Trump (without evidence) as a cure for COVID-19. Bottom line: the hospitalized patients who took it didn\u2019t seem to be any better off than patients who didn\u2019t take the drug. Some patients had to stop taking the drug because of cardiac side effects.\n\nThe report isn\u2019t published yet, and hasn\u2019t gone through the standard review process, but doctors are starting to sort through its findings. It\u2019s not a good sign for the drug. But this single study is not a killer blow, either.\n\nThat\u2019s because a lone study or single clinical trial rarely offers incontrovertible evidence to disprove or bolster a claim \u2014 especially if, like this one, the study is small. Instead, it takes the buildup of data from multiple large trials and studies to guide medical decision-making. Everyone is desperate for answers around COVID-19, so there are more eyes on each new data point added to the pile. Watching that process in real time shows how messy science can be.\n\nTherefore, HCQ does not seem useful in advanced states of #COVID19 disease. We will have to wait for the results of studies in patients with mild symptoms to understand if HCQ is able to counteract the progression of the disease.https:\/\/t.co\/0PvNzCP8L7\n\n2\/2 \u2014 Cristina Dragani (@CristinaDragani) April 14, 2020\n\nThis particular hydroxychloroquine study included 181 people, which is small enough that scientists would hesitate to draw large conclusions from its results. It was also conducted with people who were already sick enough to be hospitalized. Other studies of the drug, which reached similarly dismal conclusions about how well it worked, were also done in hospitalized patients. But still other ongoing studies are testing how well it works in people who aren\u2019t as sick, and whether it may prevent people who haven\u2019t caught the virus yet from developing the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19. With viral infections, earlier treatment tends to be better \u2014 that\u2019s why people have to take Tamiflu right when they start feeling sick in order for it to work to treat the flu, for example.\n\nScientific research doesn\u2019t usually provide yes-or-no answers. Instead, each new bit of evidence tilts the balance in one direction or another. While that\u2019s happening, doctors make preliminary choices based on where they see that balance moving \u2014 as new data continues to be reported on hydroxychloroquine, some are deciding not to use it, while others may keep trying. They won\u2019t be able to reasonably say they know for sure that it will or won\u2019t work. It\u2019s still a mostly open question, and decisions on care will still be made patient by patient for now.\n\nEventually, the balance of evidence will settle into a conclusion that experts have more confidence in. That might happen after researchers compile all the data from multiple small studies and analyze it as a group in a meta-analysis \u2014 that\u2019s what might happen with the handful of small hydroxychloroquine studies that have been published already.\n\nEven better, we might get more decisive data from larger studies. The World Health Organization\u2019s Solidarity trial, for example, is testing multiple drugs (including hydroxychloroquine) in dozens of countries. Another study on the anti-viral remdesivir, which aims to include hundreds of patients, could also provide a clearer signal. Those types of studies take more time and resources, but they produce more conclusive results.\n\nPatients are sick and dying from COVID-19 now, and there\u2019s tremendous pressure to test drugs that might help them. In the United States, though, there has been limited coordination between groups running trials. It\u2019s harder to understand where the balance of evidence lies when the research done is fragmented and disconnected, and when every researcher is asking a slightly different question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cacophony; it\u2019s not an orchestra. There\u2019s no conductor,\u201d Derek Angus, chair of the department of critical care medicine at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told The Washington Post. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said that a coordination plan was in the works.\n\nScientific research is hard under the best of circumstances. Finding answers that doctors and scientists trust is a long and frustrating process. It\u2019s many times harder during an active public health emergency, when treating patients is a priority. The constant release of new information can feel like whiplash, as something that seemed like a solution one week turns out to be less useful the next. Reframing each bit of new data as piece of the puzzle, rather than an answer on its own, can help make sense of the flood.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":344,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/16\/learning\/what-students-are-saying-about-acts-of-kindness-internet-habits-and-where-theyd-like-to-be-stranded.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-16","author":[],"title":"What Students Are Saying About Acts of Kindness, Internet Habits and Where They\u2019d Like to Be Stranded","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/04\/11\/arts\/09virus-clapping-CECLN\/09virus-clapping-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg","body_text":"For this week\u2019s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked teenagers to tell us about acts of kindness they have observed since the onset of the coronavirus.

They told us about the ways, big and small, they and other have been making an impact in their communities.\nMaking masksOne act of kindness that I\u2019ve been participating in is making masks with my mom and selling them to people for very low prices. We go to stores and buy certain fabrics and materials either with designs or no designs and make them into beautiful masks. Recently we\u2019ve been selling them to workers and they have said some very nice comments towards the masks and our dedication to helping people. Another thing I do is deliver the masks to people around our neighborhood that can\u2019t go outside so I just suit up put on my mask and gloves and head out and I can say that this has brought much joy to me especially when I know that I\u2019m using my time well and not sitting around playing video games all day.\u2014 jose Martinez, Desplaine Illinois\nI\u2019ve heard of many people sewing masks out of their materials and decontaminating them. They then can safely distribute them to people in their community to use less surgical masks that are in high demand and needed in hospitals. I think this is useful because it can also encourage people who may be sick to wear masks while they are out while simultaneously saving resources that are needed by health care workers. It\u2019s something people can do in the safety of their homes to help their community.\u2014 Kathleen S., J.R. Masterman\nCooking for othersMy mom works for the hospital and I have been volunteering to help with \u201cMeals for Heroes\u201d that is sponsored by the Greater Wilmington Business Journal and New Hanover Regional Medical Center. Different businesses are providing 100 meals per day, to the front line workers at the hospital. I have been helping hand out the meals to the hospital staff as they drive down \u201cGratitude Lane.\u201d\u2014 Daniel Guy, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC\nThroughout the coronavirus outbreak, my mom and I have cooked numerous dishes for older people we know. We made lasagna, cake, soup, various treats, vegetable plates, and more. We do so to promote them to quarantine and eliminate any reason for them to leave the house. My mom also buys groceries for her parents and older friends. I try to lighten up my grandparents by calling them. I do other types of community service within my girl scout troop, including fundraisers, making blankets and for animals in shelters, and caroling to elders. On our own, my mom and I hand out water and granola bars to homeless people. The quote \u201cit\u2019s better to give than to receive\u201d does have some truth. If you are in a place to give, then give, so someone in need gets help.\u2014 Isadora Monteith, J.R. Masterman\nDonation effortsAs the world is going through a pandemic, our school decided to send a care package to three different hospitals in South Korea (that is where I live). We donated snacks, drinks, shampoo, soap and handmade cards. I am also growing my hair so I can donate it to make wigs for children with cancer. During easter our family and some other people brought masks and gave it to others in need.\u2014 Allison Go, South Korea\nRecently, my sister and I realized that our bookcases were full of books we had not read in years, either because we had already read them, or because they were children\u2019s books. With all the free time we had over the weekend, we decided to sort through our books and decide which ones to donate. We each ended up with huge piles of books, and we organized them into categories. At this point, we could have donated all of the books to some organization. However, we wanted to know exactly where our books were going so we could feel the effect of the deed more. My mom posted pictures of all of our books on the \u201cMoms of New Rochelle\u201d Facebook group with the caption \u201cfree books.\u201d She instantly began receiving messages from mothers who said their children were running out of books to read since the libraries are now closed. We messaged back and forth with some of the mothers, suggesting books for their children based on their ages and interests. Every mother expressed gratitude; one even asked how she could repay us, telling us she could send us gloves if we wanted. We refused, partly because we did not need gloves, but also partly because the good feeling we got from doing the deed was sufficient pay.\u2014 Daviel Schulman, New Rochelle, NY\nVolunteeringDuring the coronavirus epidemic my church has supported homeless people by giving them food and items like a mask, hand sanitizer, and blankets to stay safe. Homeless people right now need as much help as possible to stay healthy during the pandemic. They don\u2019t have the money or the resources to stay afloat. I believe with everything that my church does can help them.\u2014 Izel, J.R. Masterman\nSince I can remember, my family\u2019s value system has been based on volunteering and helping others. I don\u2019t remember a season where my temple congregation was running an annual charity drive that my family did not help execute. Throughout my life I have renovated parks, run food donation trips, and organized clothing drives. Not only were these roles expected of me, it felt natural to spend my time giving to others. During the high holidays, I had the opportunity to donate over 500 bags of food to our local food kitchen with my youth group. Giving to others helped me realize that life was much bigger than what was right in front of me. The action of providing help, health and happiness to others filled me with a joy I had never experienced. I am lucky enough to be able to give onto others and it is one of the most valuable gifts one can achieve. \u2014 Hayden Roberge, New Rochelle, NY\nOne of my friends has an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. Many kids do a mitzvah protect for their Bar\/Bat Mitzvah. A mitzvah project is a project that helps other people. My friend chose to do his at the Jewish Relief Agency (JRA). At the JRA, once a month, people come to a warehouse and help pack boxes with food. Then people deliver the boxes to people who need the food. I often went to help him pack and deliver boxes with him. I think that the act was incredibly beneficial to me because It helped me realize how many people need help in this world. This experience was also really fun. That made me realize that helping others can be as exciting for you as it is for the person you are helping sometimes\u2014 Jonah Smith Posner, J.R. Masterman\nSmall, but meaningful, gestures I haven\u2019t really been able to do too many things for people other than texting and calling people to let them know I\u2019ve been thinking of them. I have been trying to make an effort to talk to people I don\u2019t normally talk with, just offering a fun conversation to distract from the world. An act I have experienced is people I don\u2019t normally talk to reaching out to talk to me, and that meant a lot, and that is what inspired me to start doing the same.\u2014 Jamie, Healy, AK\nSometime last week, my friends and their parents got together and invited our neighborhood to put up lights on each of their houses. My family put up a sign in one of our windows that reads \u201cHOPE\u201d in colorful light, and I\u2019ve seen other houses use this invitation very creatively. Throughout this pandemic, there can still be ways to illuminate the world with our goodness, even if it\u2019s from a distance.\u2014 Kaycia B., NUAMES High School, Layton UT\nI heard about people thanking garbage collectors for their work during such difficult time. A few words can go a long way, and many of these kind verbal acts have had positive impacts on these people. Even if you don\u2019t have money to donate, it\u2019s completely free to thank someone for the difficult work they\u2019re doing in such times. Those people are putting their lives at risk for us, so it\u2019s the least we can do.\u2014 Saharsh Satheesh, Collierville High School, Tennessee\nIn a dire time like this, keeping in touch and helping others really matters. This pandemic really pushes us to aid the ones we love to keep them safe, and talk to the people we truly care about to not loose communication in this month of isolation. My family has been sending food and puzzles to my grandparents to keep them busy and so they don\u2019t have to go to the store as it can be dangerous for them especially. Acts of kindness towards others are very meaningful now more than ever.\u2014 Autumn Klein, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL\nI\u2019ve been hearing from my grandma that people in her community are dropping groceries at her door so she doesn\u2019t have to go to the supermarket. These acts of kindness, which I hear are happening throughout her town, give me hope that communities will come together in these trying times. I am grateful to anyone helping the elderly right now, as they are especially vulnerable to the virus, and really cannot afford to leave their homes even for groceries.\u2014 Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ\n_________How Has the Coronavirus Changed How You Use the Internet?\nAs the coronavirus rages, homebound students are spending increasingly more time online and so we asked students about how their internet habits have changed.\nReflecting on their hyper-digital lives, many students were dismayed by the quantity and quality of their screen time and its impact on their physical, mental and emotional health. Some, however, have seized the opportunity to forge new intellectual, civic and social connections, trying to thrive amid an ongoing crisis.\nSpending much more time on the internetThe internet has turned from something that I used for entertainment and to help complete schoolwork into what my life revolves around. If I have to do school work, it\u2019s through the internet. If I want to stay in touch with my friends, it\u2019s through the internet. If I want to access anything outside of my home, it\u2019s through the internet. Consequently, the time I\u2019m spending on the internet has grown significantly since the start of quarantine. This has been frustrating because of the lack of face-to-face interaction with anyone aside from my family and exercising becoming more difficult, but it has also opened up new methods in which I can connect with my friends. Because my best friend and I can no longer see one another in person, we\u2019ve begun playing more video games together and have been bonding that way. One of our other friends had their birthday during quarantine and we had a Zoom call to celebrate which we would have never done before. \u2014 Sam McNamara, John T. Hoggard High (Wilmington, NC)\nSince my school closed originally on March 13th for two weeks, now the rest of the school year, I have been using my phone a lot more than I would in normal circumstances. I used to use my phone 2-3 hours a day but know, my daily average is around 10-12 hours, even up to 15 hours a day. I have been trying to cut down on my daily screen time but it is really hard because I have nothing else to fill my days except for it. Some of my friends are still saying they have been able to keep there screen time down to 5 hours a day and I am like how is that possible? Hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to lower my screen time once online school starts up.\u2014Ryan Altschuler, J.R Masterman School\nBinge watchingMy screentime has grown to 8 hours per day which is 6 hours more than it used to before school closed. I am using the Internet more than I ever have. I spend most of that time on Netflix where I have been binging TV shows like Money Heist, Ozark, and Tiger King. I would usually watch the Sixers game every time they play but now there are only live streams NBA stars playing H.O.R.S.E. \u2014 Leonard Vekker, J.R. Masterman PA\nThe Coronavirus has greatly impacted how much time I spend on the internet. My computer is my main source for schoolwork and entertainment. On my computer, I complete all my assignments and watch movies. My most time engaging app is Netflix. I have started binge watching all my favorite shows during all this free time. I read in an article that due to everyone staying home, Netflix\u2019s memberships have doubled. One con towards all this screen time is that it causes many headaches. I spend every day staring at my screen that my head starts to hurt. This is where I take some time to go outside and enjoy the nice weather.\u2014 Yahaira H, Cass High School, Georgia\nGoing to school onlineThe coronavirus has definitely changed the way I use the internet. It has effected me the most in school. I spend about 2-4 hours a day doing online work or video conferences. In some ways online school is better. For example my math teacher post videos of her doing the lesson. Now I am able to go at my own pace, I can pause if I need or re watch something I didn\u2019t understand.\nOn the other hand I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I\u2019ve been assigned. It is far more stressful than doing the work at school. It is also difficult because there is lack in communication. I don\u2019t always understand what I\u2019m supposed to do for some assignments. I\u2019ve also had problems with online conferences. I\u2019ve had teachers that accidentally say the wrong time to meet, or not being able to reach some students.\u2014 Tiana, Utah\nWith the recent spread of the pandemic, I find that online school has impacted me the most. Not only I can\u2019t see my friends from school, online school is also way more stressful that normal school. It can be hard to do school when there are so many distractions like YouTube and looking on social media. Or even not feeling motivated to do online school. But the worst part it just trying to find and do the assignments and getting good grades.\u2014 Morgan, Eugene OR\nI realized that my habits have changed. I use my phone as soon as I wake up to check Google Classroom notifications, not Instagram. The whole situation is ironic because in school, I had the temptation to scroll through Instagram, yet when home, I find myself motivated to achieve the satisfaction of finishing assignments and clicking that submit button. The time I used to spend checking snapchat stories is now time I use to listen to podcasts on Spotify. I find myself naturally distancing from the one object I was addicted to three months ago.\u2014 Akshara Koottala, New Rochelle High School, NY\nTrying something newBefore coronavirus, I had begun to start relying on my phone less often than usual. My screen time went from five to three hours, and I finally realized that I did not need my phone as much as I thought I did. However, once we were out of school and sports were cancelled, I was on my phone for up to eight or nine hours a day, which is crazy! \u2026\nOn the bright side, I have started using Twitter more (for news and entertainment purposes), and I am striving to become stronger in financial literacy and the stock market, since it is such a crazy time right now on Wall Street. One of my father\u2019s friends began day trading to pass the time, so it is interesting to hear from him about how his stocks and his money are standing, even with the market as bad as it is.\u2014 Carter Osborn, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC\nThe CoronaVirus has hardly affected my internet usage at all. My screen time has barely gone up at all. I used to average around 15-16 hours on my phone each day, and now I average just about 16 hours. However now I do diversify what I do on my electronics. To pass the time I have been using my electronics to do things like mastering a skill and trying new games\u2014 Nathanael Kassahun, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA\nBuilding relationshipsI find that I get anxious when I spend more time of social media platforms. This being said, now that many of my relationships are based off of screen interaction, I have had to remind myself to spend more time on the phone with friends as opposed to messaging them. Calling someone or FaceTiming them leaves me happier and less anxious then when I type our conversations. I\u2019ve started to call a person per day while social distancing \u2026 and it has really helped improve my mental health. I highly recommend!\u2014 Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ\nMy friends and I also try to talk and video chat more often, also allowing me to have a form of social interaction through the internet. I find myself video chatting with family members more consistently rather than talking to them on the phone every few weeks. This allows me to see them virtually, and even though they live thousands of miles away, this allows me to feel closer to them.\nWhile the coronavirus has provided a grand number of changes, the internet has allowed me to keep some consistency and routines in these tough times. Without the online access that we have, I cannot imagine how the world would be able to handle the pandemic since so much of our lives revolve around being connected online.\u2014 Nora Shefferman, New Rochelle High School, NY\nMourningMy experience has been 50\/50 because 2 of my family members died due to the virus and my brother and law had survived the virus and spent two weeks in the hospital. The graph does match my experience because my family is sad of our family members that died and they were important to our lives. There are many videos of nurses crying and how the death rates have grown in New York in the past 2 months and nurses quitting there job to support there families\u2014 Arturo Salas, Queens\n_________Where Would You Like to Be Stranded?\nA couple from South Africa found themselves stranded on their honeymoon in the Maldives after their country closed its borders to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\nInspired by their story, we asked students were they would like to be during the pandemic in our Picture Prompt, \u201cStuck in Paradise.\u201d From beaches to their homes to Target, here\u2019s what they had to say:A tropical getawayIf I was stranded, I would want to be on a beach that has all of the supplies I need to survive. Such as fruits, wood, and things to build a fire. I would probably take one or two of my friends just to try the experiment. I would also bring snorkel stuff and maybe try to borrow a surfboard so I can have fun. I might also bring my dog. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about COVID-19. I would want to get away so that I can get rid of all the anxiety and stress. I might also bring my dog.\u2014 Hen, Des Moines, Iowa\nIf I could be stuck somewhere in the world during this pandemic it would definitely be the Bahamas. The Bahamas is such a beautiful place to spend time and the water is so clear. I would be spending most of my time at the beach or a nice beach house. I would certainly miss my family but if I had the choice, they would be there with me. The Bahamas would definitely take my mind off of the horrible things happening recently with the virus. I could just stay there and relax without having to think about anything.\u2014 Kaitlyn Frances, New York\nWith loved onesMy sister was studying abroad in Paris this year. When Trump closed all travel from Europe, my family was freaking out. They weren\u2019t sure if that meant my sister wouldn\u2019t be able to fly home. That night, my mom waited on hold with Air France for 3 hours in order to get my sister on the soonest flight home to Chicago. Although I was excited that my sister was coming home, at first I was confused why everyone was freaking out so much. I personally would much rather be trapped in Paris, than in the snow here in Chicago. After careful consideration, I realized why it was so important for her to come home. The most essential thing right now is that families stick together. If my sister was still in Paris, my parents would never stop stressing out.\nSo in the end, I would like to be quarantined with my loved ones. (If I really had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t mind doing my e learning by the pool) But for now, I wouldn\u2019t care where I was, as long as my family was all together.\u2014 Ellie Short, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL\nI don\u2019t know if stranded would be the right vernacular but if I could be quarantined in any place during this pandemic I would want to go to Korea. I am Korean by my parents and while my immediate family is here in Southern California, my entire extended family is in Korea. Having been to my home country multiple times in the past I know how amazing and different the life there is. But especially during my only-child life-at-home experience, I realized that I want nothing more than to be with my family and my people. \u2014 Brenda Kim, Valencia High School\nIf I were to be quarantined anywhere, I would probably choose Cuba. I have lots of family there who I never get to see, and staying with them for an extended period of time is a luxury for me and my family. Not only would I get to spend time with the people I love, I would get to enjoy the weather and explore the island with my cousins and brother.\u2014 Lucia T, Brooklyn, NY\nI would want to be stuck in the band room of my school, that is where I have had the best memories, and would be around my favorite people, its truly my home away from home and would do anything to be there right now.\u2014 Abigail, Pennsylvania\nSomewhere funIf I had to be quarantined anywhere it would definitely be a mountain house in the Lake Tahoe area. I would want to be quarantined here because while the main ski resorts are close you can never really close the backcountry. And while It would definitely be a challenge I think it would be a ton of fun.\u2014 Isaac, Brooklyn Ny\nI would want to be stranded in Alabama where I could be playing with baby fainting goats, relaxing, being in the heat, eating barbecue, drinking sweet tea and working in the gardens. I would be riding a tractor and swimming.\u2014 Kate Schwartzman, NYC\nI would honestly like to be stranded in Traverse City, Michigan during the summertime. The weather is absolutely amazing in that time of the year. I\u2019d rather experience the fascination of the sunset in the Grand Traverse Bay rather than being stuck at home during this pandemic constantly getting bored. I\u2019ve had a few days where I have rode my bike through my neighborhood, but it isn\u2019t as enjoyable as walking through the downtown area of Traverse City and visiting the shops in the area. The breeze I tend to get in my area doesn\u2019t feel as good as the breeze you get on Pangea\u2019s Pizza\u2019s rooftop seating while having a basket of cajun jerk french fries.\u2014 Gavin Meek, Detroit, MI\nA strategic locationIf I could be stuck anywhere during this quarantine, it would be in Target. It is literally the smartest option and one of the best places on Earth. If your bored they have televisions, phones, and video games. If your hungry they have a food section and even a (Starbucks depending on your location). You also do not have to worry about weather or animals because it is indoors \u2026 It is also the perfect opportunity to do things almost everyone secretly wishes they could do in Target like create a mountain of pillows or ride the carts up and down the aisle.\u2014 Ashira, Cambria Heights\nI would be stuck in my video game room. It\u2018s not necessarily paradise but it is my favorite pass time. I would never get bored because the vide games are with me. Honestly that sounds awesome to me.\u2014 Atticus, Earth\nIf I were stranded somewhere during this pandemic, I would like to be stranded on Pitcairn Island, South Pacific. I would want to be stuck there because the Island is very remote with only 50 people currently living there. The chances of me getting the virus is less likely in a more remote location rather that a place that is densely populated. Also, because it is not very populated, there will be more resources to go around like food and water. And because it is surrounded by water, there should be plenty of fish to eat and fish is a good source of vitamins and minerals. My last and final reason why I chose this place is because the views are amazing and I would probably spend my days swimming in the clear water and hiking in the forest.\u2014 Franklin, Philadelphia\nI know this is weird, but I\u2019d want to be stuck in Singapore Changi Airport. That place is huge, filled with entertainment, and looks absolutely stunning! I would just spend my days walking around and exploring that airport, I\u2019ve heard they have entire malls, and even rooms for people to stay in. Being stuck in one place sucks, but at least I\u2019m in an airport, when ever the pandemic ends, I\u2019d be the one of the first to get on a flight and go home.\u2014 Khang T, Saint Louis\nNo place like homeDuring a pandemic, there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be than at home. A tropical island or some exotic place would seem nice at first, but then I\u2019d start to feel lonely, and the fear of getting sick would outweigh any feelings of excitement for being on vacation. By being stuck at home, I\u2019m with my family and near my friends. At home, the feeling of familiarity outweighs any fear of getting sick.\u2014 NK, King of Prussia\nIf I were to be stranded somewhere during a pandemic, I would want to be home. Yes, of course being on a tropical island with the sun shining down on you all day would be amazing. But during such a strange time, I\u2019d want to be somewhere a safe and with people I trust. I would spend my time relaxing and learning new things, trying to find new hobbies. Being stuck somewhere not able to go home would be a challenge but that means you are in a whole new environment so I\u2019d embrace it and see if there is something there I can do.\u2014 Brandon, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL\nIf I was stuck somewhere I would want it to be my home because my home is were my family is and since I am just a kid, I can\u2019t Survive anywhere else. Plus, I love my family, they give me food and shelter, they care for me. So if there is anywhere I would want to get stuck at. It would be my home.\u2014 Konrad Filbeck, Bethesda Maryland","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":346,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/16\/21224166\/pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19-personal-change-sister-julia-walsh-catholic-nun","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-16","author":[],"title":"Letting the pandemic change us for the better","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/ebiShTrgomXdviAtVvETWswTqeQ=\/0x851:3318x2588\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19907157\/1219229174.jpg.jpg","body_text":"When I was 24 years old, I fell off a cliff and shattered my face. Surviving a life-threatening accident at a young age transformed me. Afterwards, I had no more illusions about my mortality or the sacredness of time. I discovered a new urgency to live well. My long-term goals came front and center.\n\nFrom my accident I learned that the smallest choices made while in crisis significantly influence our futures \u2014 even more so than during the ordinary times of life. Each moment matters. The potential of time is magnified. How we handle tough times really does define us.\n\nOpinion\n\nNow, our entire society is in crisis as we scramble to survive the coronavirus pandemic. None of us have clarity about when this will end. What we do during these days is crucial to our futures.\n\nAs I write this, I am in day 36 of \u201csheltering in place.\u201d As I adjust to this reality, I notice that the little choices I make are transforming me. I tidy my bedroom more. I finally bought a watch, hoping to look at my phone less. Although this may be mundane, I wonder how these new habits will change me.\n\nI was curious whether others were forming new habits too; if anyone else was finding themselves using time differently. So I asked my Twitter followers, \u201cWhat new thing are you doing now in quarantine that you hope to keep doing after this madness ends?\u201d\n\nI found that some people are using this time to nurture their creative sides. One friend is learning new folk songs with her partner. Others are learning to play classical masterpieces. One woman told me she is writing her memoirs for her grandchildren.\n\nI noticed that others \u201csheltering in place\u201d are developing their domestic sides. Some are cleaning more. Many people are organizing their pantries and baking so much bread the stores are on short on yeast.\n\nWith death counts in the daily headlines, we are more aware of the sacredness of our relationships. Parents are, by necessity, becoming more involved with the education of their kids, sometimes learning alongside them. We\u2019re talking on the phone more. We are even writing letters again.\n\nAmid the anxiety and fear, we recognize this time as an opportunity to redefine who we are. We can restructure how we live our lives \u2014and this can be both a challenge and a gift.\n\nThe writer Jessica Mesman tweeted that this crisis has graced her with is a different understanding of time: \u201cI no longer feel rushed. Time has elongated. There seems like there will be time for everything. That\u2019s unnerving but it\u2019s also showing me how much of my busy-ness was self-imposed.\u201d\n\nNow that time has been rearranged we have choices to make. We each have a chance to decide: who do I want to be during and after this crisis and how can I use time differently in order to become that person?\n\nWhile life is taking on a new structure, new habits are being established and priorities being revealed \u2014 along the way we are becoming new people. Many of us are living through profound trauma and grief. But we might also become more grounded and connected; more intentional, authentic and emotionally healthy. During this crisis, we can all change for the better.\n\nJulia Walsh is a Franciscan Sister of Perpetual Adoration Her writing can be found in America, National Catholic Reporter, The Christian Century, Living Faith and at MessyJesusBusiness.com.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":372,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/cannabis\/2020\/4\/20\/21228425\/wiz-khalifa-billy-ray-cyrus-4-20-virtual-celebration-weedmaps-cannabis-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-20","author":"['Evan F.

Patients can now get those prescriptions via a phone call or videoconference with a doctor.\n\nAddiction experts have been calling for that change for years to help expand access for patients in many parts of the country that have shortages of physicians eligible to prescribe these medication-assisted treatments. A federal report in January found that 40% of U.S. counties don't have a single health care provider approved to prescribe buprenorphine, an active ingredient in Suboxone.\n\nA 2018 law called for the new policy, but regulations were never finalized.\n\n\"I wish there was another way to get this done besides a pandemic,\" says Dr. David Kan, chief medical officer of Bright Heart Health, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company. It has recently started working with insurers and health providers to help addicted patients get therapy and medications without having to leave their homes. He said he hopes the administration will make the changes permanent after the national emergency ends.\n\nYears before the emergency regulations were issued, Bright Heart \u2014 along with several other telemedicine counseling providers \u2014 began offering opioid addiction treatment and counseling via telemedicine, even if they couldn't prescribe initial medication for addiction. Patients can renew prescriptions for drugs to deal with withdrawal symptoms, get drug-tested and meet with counselors for therapy.\n\nWhen Nathan Post needed help overcoming a decade-long drug addiction, he went online in 2018 and used Bright Heart Health to connect to a doctor and weekly individual and group counseling sessions. He says the convenience is a big benefit.\n\n\"As an addict, it was easy to have excuses not to do stuff, but this was easy because I could just be in my living room and turn on my computer, so I had no reason to blow it off,\" he says.\n\nPost, 38, a tattoo artist who recently moved from New Mexico to Iowa City, Iowa, was addicted to Suboxone, the drug he was prescribed in 2009 to deal with an addiction to opioid pills.\n\nOfficials with the insurer Anthem say Bright Heart's telemedicine option has helped increase medication-assisted treatment for members with opioid drug abuse issues from 16% to more than 30% in California and nine other states. While fewer than 5% of Anthem patients seeking addiction treatment use telemedicine, the company expects the option to become more common.\n\nOne barometer of the effectiveness of the care, Bright Heart Health officials say, is that 90% of patients are still in treatment after 30 days and 65% after 90 days \u2014 far higher than with traditional treatment.\n\nSeveral insurers across the country \u2014 including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield companies such as Anthem \u2014 have begun covering the telemedicine addiction service.\n\nDr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, says there are some downsides to virtual care.\n\n\"I think therapists and providers do worry whether it provides the same level of engagement with the patient and whether it's possible to gauge someone's sincerity and level of motivation as easily over a camera as in person,\" she says.\n\nNonetheless, she predicts telemedicine service will grow because of the tremendous need to broaden access to mental health and addiction counseling. \"Too often the default is no counseling for patients,\" she said. \"This gives us another set of tools.\"\n\nPatients can also have trouble finding a doctor who is eligible to prescribe medication to help treat addiction. Physicians are required to get a federal license to prescribe Suboxone and other controlled substances that help patients with opioid addiction, and they can write only limited numbers of prescriptions each month. Many doctors hesitate to seek that qualification.\n\nA few small studies have found that patients are as likely to stay with telemedicine treatment as with in-person care for drug addiction. But no studies have determined whether one type of therapy is more effective.\n\nTelemedicine does have its limits, and it is not right for everyone, particularly patients who require more intensive inpatient care or who lack easy Internet access, Komaromy says.\n\nPremera Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials say they are partnering with Boulder Care, a digital recovery program based in Portland, Ore., to help customers in rural Alaska. \"Telemedicine is a unique way for someone to go through treatment in a discreet manner,\" says Rick Abbott, a Premera vice president.\n\nWhile telemedicine has been growing in popularity for physical medicine, some people may still be reluctant to use it for drug addiction.\n\nThere are also concerns that allowing providers to prescribe controlled substances without meeting patients in person could increase the risk of fraud.\n\n\"There is a fear around this that there may be some rogue providers who make a lot of money off addiction and will do it stealthily on the Internet,\" says Dr. Alyson Smith, an addiction medicine specialist with Boulder Care. \"While that is a small risk, we have to compare it to the huge benefit of expanding treatment that will save lives.\"\n\nSmith says she doesn't notice a big difference in treating patients for drug addiction in her office compared with on a video screen. She can still see patients' pupils to make sure they are dilated and ask patients about how they are feeling \u2014 physical and emotional signs that can help determine whether it's appropriate to prescribe certain drugs. Dilated pupils are a sign of patients suffering from withdrawal from heroin and other drugs.\n\nDr. Dawn Abriel, who treated Post and previously directed a methadone clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., says she can diagnose patients over video without issue.\n\n\"I can pick up an awful lot on the video,\" particularly a patient's body language, she says. \"I think people open up to me more because they are sitting in their homes and in their place of comfort.\"\n\nIn West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid addiction epidemic, Highmark, a Blue Cross Blue Shield company, started offering telehealth addiction coverage with Bright Heart Health in January. Highmark officials say a lack of health providers, particularly in rural parts of the state, meant that many of the insurer's members had difficulty finding the help they needed.\n\nDr. Caesar DeLeo, vice president and executive medical director of strategic initiatives for Highmark, says the insurer had been having problems getting customers into care. Only about a third of members with addiction issues were receiving treatment, he says.\n\n\"We needed to address the crisis with a new approach,\" DeLeo says. \"This will give people more options and give primary care doctors who do not want to prescribe Suboxone another place to refer patients.\"\n\nDeLeo says patients will also be referred to Bright Heart in hospital emergency rooms.\n\nDr. Paul Leonard, an emergency doctor and medical director for Workit Health, an Ann Arbor, Mich., company offering telemedicine treatment and counseling programs, says many patients who turn to ERs for addiction treatment get little help finding counseling.\n\nWith online therapy, patients can sign up while still in the ER.\n\n\"We've built a better mousetrap,\" Leonard says.\n\nProviders who specialize in addiction medicine and have recently turned to telemedicine say they and their patients are getting more accustomed to virtual care.\n\n\"There are always times you wish you could reach out and hold someone's hand, and you can't do that,\" says Boulder's Smith. \"But we feel like we are more skilled at a virtual hand-holding and really connect with people \u2014 and they feel well supported in return.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

He was the third person to die of COVID-19 while jailed, and 353 incarcerated people and 261 staff have since then tested positive.\n\n\u201cI feel like I lost the battle for my husband,\u201d Lee\u2019s widow told the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nMost people in Cook County Jail have not been convicted of any crime, and are being held because they don\u2019t have the money to post bail. But even as the number of people in the jail who are sick with COVID-19 increases, another week has passed without significant action by county officials to reduce the jail population.\n\nOpinion\n\nSocial distancing is impossible in the crowded and unsanitary confines of the jail, which is now one of the foremost sites of the pandemic in the nation. Close quarters create a kind of Russian roulette death penalty for people awaiting trial. COVID-19 cases soon could overwhelm the jail\u2019s health systems, creating chaos and making the facility difficult to secure. County leaders must rapidly find ways to responsibly release people and provide housing and safe quarantine outside of the jail.\n\nAs researchers, we have been tracking the ways that jails and prisons increase the spread of COVID-19. There are still more than 4,300 people being held in Cook County Jail, and the rate of spread of the virus is about 33 times higher inside the jail than it is in the city of Chicago.\n\nAfrican Americans are jailed disproportionately in Cook County, and this crisis is further heightening racial inequality. While the courts have slowed the number of people entering the jail, releases have not risen to the level required to prevent mass deaths. Each day that passes without a significant reduction in the jail population imperils the health of incarcerated people, jail employees and their families, as well as the health of all those who live in the surrounding communities.\n\nThe pandemic is revealing the ways in which Cook County has used the jail to address a myriad of social problems; many people are held in jail because they have an addiction, are homeless, or struggle with mental illness. According to the Chicago Community Bond Fund, at least 260 people languish in jail simply because they are poor and cannot afford to post a low cash bond. Those who pose no threat to public safety should not be held in jail, but Cook County\u2019s social safety net is thin, so jail is often used in place of a homeless shelter or psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn mid-March, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and Public Defender Amy Campanelli worked together to identify a list of hundreds of people who could be released from jail without posing a threat to public safety. While an important first step, this process was not exhaustive, and many more cases should be considered for release.\n\nIt is time for Cook County officials, Chief Judge Tim Evans and Criminal Division Chief Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. to get back to the table, identify all people who can be safely released and create a process for expedited hearings and releases. If they don\u2019t, it could soon become impossible to provide medical care for the number of cases in the Cook County Jail, and these cases threaten to overwhelm the county\u2019s medical systems.\n\nSheriff Tom Dart has taken steps to improve sanitation and distancing practices in the jail, including the moving of people to single cells, but no one can meaningfully control the spread of COVID-19 or prevent mass deaths in a crowded jail. Hand soap and sanitizer are rationed, hundreds of people share bathrooms, and health care is in short supply. Even when assigned to single cells, people sleep within a few feet of one another.\n\nIt is not too late to responsibly release people from Cook County Jail, strengthening the county\u2019s efforts to flatten the curve of the spread of the coronavirus. A coalition of civil rights groups has sued Dart in federal court to secure the immediate release of many of those being held in the jail. On April 9, a federal court sent the suit back to a state court, creating further delays.\n\nCook County leaders should look to San Francisco, where efforts to control COVID-19 in the local jail have been swift and effective. The San Francisco district attorney and public defender worked together to quickly reduce the jail population by 40%. They assessed who was safe for release, including the elderly, some veterans, those being held for misdemeanors, those awaiting placement in a mental health facility, those being detained simply because of an inability to pay bail, and those already scheduled for release.\n\nSan Francisco has proved that mass release can be done safely.\n\nJust as Mayor Lori Lightfoot acted quickly to repurpose McCormick Place to treat COVID-19 cases, fast action must be taken to depopulate the jail now, so that detainees and community members alike can effectively practice social distancing.\n\nLightfoot has led efforts to turn empty downtown hotels into housing for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but have mild symptoms. Why can\u2019t empty hotel rooms across the city be used to house those who need a safe place to quarantine after release from jail?\n\nCreative housing solutions that offer people a safe two-week quarantine upon release, along with greatly expanded access to testing for COVID-19 for everyone in contact with the jail, could save the lives not only of incarcerated people, but also jail workers and others.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, \u201cjustice too long delayed is justice denied.\u201d\n\nIn this case, justice delayed is spiking the curve and putting everyone\u2019s lives in danger.\n\nAmanda Klonsky (@amandaklonsky1) is chief program officer for a prison education organization.

Instead, it has been reduced to an online replica because of stay-at-home orders to curb the pandemic.\n\nGet the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.\n\nVirtual parties and video chats are replacing vast outdoor smoking sessions to mark the rise of legalization and celebrate cannabis culture. The origins of the annual celebration are believed tied to a group of Northern California high school friends, who used the code as slang for smoking pot in the early 1970s.\n\n\u201cStay home,\u201d the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, said bluntly. San Francisco Mayor London Breed threatened arrests: \u201cWe will not tolerate anyone coming to San Francisco for 4\/20 this year.\u201d\n\nFor businesses, 4\/20 is usually their once-a-year Black Friday, when sales soar. Instead, they are reporting up-and-down buying and pondering an uncertain future.\n\nThe pandemic means the world economy could face its worst year since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In a sign of what\u2019s to come, U.S. retail sales overall dropped nearly 9% in March \u2014 a record. Millions are out of work.\n\nAs for the holiday, \u201cthere\u2019s a somber feeling to this one,\u201d said Jordan Lams, CEO of Pure CA, which specializes in marijuana extracts and does business as Moxie brand products. Before the outbreak, \u201cit was going to be the biggest 4\/20 in history,\u201d Lams said.\n\nSteve White, CEO of Arizona-based Harvest Health & Recreation, said he\u2019s watching to see if consumers treat marijuana more like beer or toilet paper when money runs short.\n\nWhen the economy tumbles, beer sales traditionally spike. With toilet paper, panic-buying might empty shelves but people do not use more of it. They just buy less later.\n\nIt will be a telling year, because no one in the relatively new industry knows if sales will plunge, stay flat or even rise.\n\n\u201cDo people buy less cannabis, or does it become more ingrained as part of their daily life?\u201d White said.\n\nThe uncertainty in the market poses the latest challenge for an industry that\u2019s expanded in some form to all but a handful of states.\n\nThe risks are spotlighted in California, where businesses contend with hefty taxes, an illicit market that still dwarfs the legal one and a tourism-reliant economy that\u2019s crippled by virus restrictions.\n\nBecause cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, most banks don\u2019t want to do business with pot companies and they aren\u2019t included in the coronavirus rescue package that will help other businesses.\n\nBefore the virus, \u201cwe were already teetering on ... an edge of a cannabis collapse,\u201d said Los Angeles dispensary owner Jerred Kiloh, who heads the United Cannabis Business Association. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for cannabis businesses to make it through this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s despite the onset of stay-at-home orders in March that sent marijuana sales rocketing; some businesses reported single-day records as customers stocked up. New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles were among the cities that labeled dispensaries essential businesses that could remain open.\n\nBut since then, business generally has flattened or tapered off, even with deliveries and curbside pickups growing to reduce health risks. Marijuana data trackers BDS Analytics documented sales surges through much of March, but then consumers pulled back in late March and early April, with sales mostly below average.\n\nIn Oregon, cannabis retailers saw a huge spike last month \u2014 a 30% increase in average sales per retailer compared with March 2019. Sales increases mid-month were even larger.\n\nHowever, the peak has leveled off and customers are coming in less frequently but buying more, said David Alport, who owns two Bridge City Collective stores in Portland. He\u2019s hired three more employees to handle home deliveries.\n\nIn Illinois, marijuana businesses can keep operating under Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s stay-at-home order. Companies made sweeping changes that included appointment-only sales and online ordering.\n\nThe Mission dispensary on Chicago\u2019s South Side saw an initial spike in purchases before the lockdown took effect, but that\u2019s leveled off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never faced an economic downturn when cannabis was legal,\u201d said Kris Krane, president of Mission dispensaries. \u201cThis is completely unprecedented.\u201d\n\nSome customers could be especially vulnerable during an economic downturn. Among cannabis users in states where its legal, 32% have incomes below $35,000 and only 54% have full-time employment, according to BDS Analytics. Anyone on a tight budget might be more apt to avoid taxes that go with legal purchases and buy from illicit market dealers.\n\nSteve DeAngelo, co-founder of Harborside dispensaries in California, said it\u2019s difficult to predict what\u2019s next, with no template for how cannabis consumers will react in a deep economic downturn.\n\nStill, he notes that the industry has endured for years through times good and bad, even when consumers had only one option \u2014 illegal purchases. Consumers who see marijuana as part of their daily routine will keep coming back, he predicted.\n\nBut, for businesses, there will be a \u201csorting out,\u201d DeAngelo said. Companies with strong brands and cash reserves are likely to fare better in a poor economy; those saddled with heavy debt who made too-rosy promises to investors will face challenges.\n\n\u201cThere is not going to be an extinction moment,\u201d DeAngelo said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to prove more resilient than many, many other industries.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":381,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/20\/technology\/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-20","author":"['Steve Lohr']","title":"New York Needed Ventilators. So They Developed One in a Month.","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/04\/17\/business\/17virus-vent1\/17virus-vent1-facebookJumbo.jpg","body_text":"This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series, which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve.\nThe nudge came in an email in early March from an Italian friend alarmed by how fast the deadly coronavirus was spreading in his country.\nA shortage of ventilators, he told Scott Cohen and Marcel Botha, was a critical problem in Italy, and he warned that it soon would be in the United States, too. He urged the pair to apply their skills to the ventilator challenge.\nBoth Mr. Cohen, co-founder of a technology center for researchers and start-ups, and Mr. Botha, chief executive of a product design and development company, were skeptical. A standard ventilator, with thousands of parts requiring a complex global supply chain, was hardly a device that could be manufactured quickly and affordably.\n\u201cI was dismissive at first,\u201d said Mr. Botha, whose company is called 10XBeta. \u201cIt looked impossible.\u201d\nBut they soon found a design for a basic ventilator that could serve as their core technology. Since then, they have orchestrated from New York a far-flung collaboration of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, physicians and regulatory experts and accomplished in a month what would normally take a year or more.\nThe result are machines known as \u201cbridge\u201d ventilators, or automatic resuscitators, priced at $3,300. They are mainly meant to help less critically ill patients breathe. If patients become sicker, with lung function more compromised by the disease, they still need to be placed on standard ventilators, which typically cost more than $30,000.\nOn Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the new device, the Spiro Wave, to be used on patients in hospitals, under an expedited process called emergency use authorization.\nThe project was initially targeted at New York City as a stopgap solution for what only a month ago appeared to be a looming, life-threatening shortage of ventilators in the city.\nBut the urgency has receded for now. While the city\u2019s coronavirus death toll continues to mount, hospital admissions are trending down, and intensive-care units seem to have enough ventilators.\nBut health experts say a machine like the Spiro Wave should be a valuable tool in the arsenal of treatment. It can, they say, expand access to breathing assistance in other parts of the country as the pandemic spreads, and especially to rural communities without major medical centers. And capable, low-cost machines could greatly expand access to treatment in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nThe New York group has fielded inquiries from across the United States and from companies and governments worldwide. It plans to license its design for free.\nThe project is one of several pushes in America and abroad to streamline ventilator design and lower costs. This month, Medtronic got F.D.A. approval to offer in the United States a ventilator that it sells in 35 other countries for an average price of less than $10,000. The company is also making the machine\u2019s blueprint freely available to other manufacturers.\nThe hurry-up engineering feat relied on human networks; two in particular stand out. The original design came from a classroom project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a decade ago. Since the coronavirus outbreak, M.I.T. professors and students have worked to upgrade the design in collaboration with outside groups. And several key contributors to the project are M.I.T. alumni.\nThe other network is the government and business community of New York, where Mr. Cohen and Mr. Botha are based. The city government took on the role of a risk-taking venture investor, first with a $100,000 research grant and then a nearly $10 million agreement to buy 3,000 of the basic ventilators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a start-up that has made unbelievable progress in a short time,\u201d said James Patchett, chief executive of New York City\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, which backed the project.\nThe New York ventilator effort got underway after widespread warnings of shortages. In mid-March, Mayor Bill de Blasio held a conference call with top staff members. Mr. de Blasio recalled that the looming ventilator shortage was \u201cscary as hell.\u201d New York had no ventilator producers, but he told his staff to do and spend what it took to solve the problem.\nThe city\u2019s economic development chief, Mr. Patchett, who was on the call, knew Mr. Cohen and his technology center, New Lab, which is in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mr. Cohen told him about the ventilator-design project that he was putting together. It sounded promising, and the city made its initial grant.\nLater, on March 25, after further development of the M.I.T. design, critical care physicians from city\u2019s public hospitals and two private hospitals saw the most recent version of the machine. That evening Mr. Patchett called Dr. Mitchell Katz, who leads the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates the city\u2019s public hospitals.\n\u201cWe should definitely do this,\u201d Dr. Katz recalled telling Mr. Patchett.The project had launched about 10 days earlier, after Mr. Cohen, on the recommendation of a scientist friend in San Francisco, got in touch with Alex Slocum, a renowned mechanical engineer at M.I.T. whose class created the design in 2010.\nA group of faculty and students \u2014 Mr. Slocum led hardware design, and Daniela Rus, a professor and robotics expert, led software development \u2014 worked to upgrade the design to help coronavirus patients. The device would have to be able to push air into badly impaired lungs at several times the force used to resuscitate a normal lung.\n\u201cThis was going to take a serious machine,\u201d Mr. Slocum recalled.The New York group began closely collaborating with the M.I.T. team. Dr. Albert Kwon, an M.I.T. graduate and a medical adviser on the project who is an anesthesiologist at the Westchester Medical Center, and Mr. Botha, also an M.I.T. alumnus, and others from New York made several trips to Boston for joint work and testing.\nThe M.I.T. academics\u2019 goal has been mainly to develop designs and share information on a website. But the mission for the New York group was to make the low-cost ventilators quickly. The hub of that effort is a former perfume factory in Long Island City, Queens, that is now home to a high-tech manufacturer, Boyce Technologies.\nThe temperature of everyone who enters the brick building is taken, a precaution against infection. The 100,000-square-foot facility combines engineering and production with robots, a clean room, and circuitry and software design departments.\nManufacturing, engineering and medical experts have worked side by side for three weeks. Dozens of versions of the machine have been carted off to the dumpster, as upgrades and improvements were made. In recent days, M.I.T. engineers traveled to Queens to help with last-minute software tweaks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you can\u2019t see in a model,\u201d said Charles Boyce, the founder and chief executive of Boyce Technologies. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t manufacture something at scale, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not going to have an impact.\u201d\nProducing thousands of machines means lining up sometimes scarce supplies. One of those parts was an air-pressure sensor to ensure that a patient\u2019s lungs were not overinflated, which could cause damage. Mr. Cohen knew that Honeywell was a leading producer of the sensor, and he tapped his network of personal contacts to secure it in volume.\nLate one night, Mr. Cohen called Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group of the city\u2019s top executives. Kevin Burke, a former chief executive of New York-based Con Edison, is a Honeywell board member. Introductions were made, and after a series of calls to Honeywell executives in America and Asia, a supply of the sensors was secured.\nThe New York ventilator project was intended to address a seemingly urgent need before large-scale initiatives \u2014 such as a Ford-General Electric partnership \u2014 began to produce ventilators.\nWhile New York\u2019s crisis has eased, Dr. Katz cautioned that pandemic viruses are unpredictable and mutate. A later variant, or second wave, in the fall could be less lethal or more, as was the case with the second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\u201cThis is still a useful option to have, even if there is not the urgency there was,\u201d he said.The low-cost ventilator, Mayor de Blasio said, is an \u201cinvaluable tool\u201d and part of the stockpile of medical equipment and supplies the city needs as \u201cinsurance against a Phase 2\u201d of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe have to get through this first,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the future, we have to have an ongoing self-sufficiency effort in New York. What we\u2019ve gone through should be a never-again moment.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":390,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/21\/21229273\/home-coronavirus-test-labcorp-fda-ppe-swab-pixel-health-care","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-21","author":"['Nicole Wetsman']","title":"First at-home COVID-19 testing kit authorized by the FDA","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/xsirB42xmz38XsLvtPeAop8Mbfk=\/0x430:6000x3571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19914872\/1219386240.jpg.jpg","body_text":"The US Food and Drug Administration has issued the first authorization for an at-home COVID-19 test kit. LabCorp, the diagnostics company producing the tests, says it will give first access to health care workers and first responders.\n\nWith this test, people who are eligible can swab their nose to collect a fluid sample, but they will still need to send it to a lab for testing. Self-sampling sidesteps the need for a clinician to perform the test, reducing their exposure to symptomatic patients. It also frees up more personal protective equipment, which is in short supply. The test costs $119.\n\nPeople taking this test would swirl a cotton swab just inside their nostril. When clinicians take samples for a COVID-19 test, they stick a swab very deep into a patient\u2019s nose, to where the back of their nose meets the top of their throat. Self-administered nose swabs are just as accurate as those more invasive swabbing methods, according to an analysis done by UnitedHealth Group and the Gates Foundation. The FDA started allowing those types of swabs at the end of March, although the agency said they still had to be done under the supervision of a clinician.\n\nA number of biotech startups have created and tried to market at-home tests over the past month, claiming that they\u2019re able to produce them under rules that allow certified labs to design and distribute their own tests. The FDA, though, had said that any test kit that allows people to collect their own samples at home needed additional authorization. The LabCorp test, produced by its consumer-focused testing brand, Pixel, is the first to secure that authorization. The laboratory portion of its test had already been approved for use, but it still relied on samples collected by health care workers.

One of those parts was an air-pressure sensor to ensure that a patient\u2019s lungs were not overinflated, which could cause damage. Mr. Cohen knew that Honeywell was a leading producer of the sensor, and he tapped his network of personal contacts to secure it in volume. Late one night, Mr. Cohen called Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group of the city\u2019s top executives. Kevin Burke, a former chief executive of New York-based Con Edison, is a Honeywell board member. Introductions were made, and after a series of calls to Honeywell executives in America and Asia, a supply of the sensors was secured.\u201d\n\nThe result of the project is a low cost ventilator that will be an \u201cinvaluable tool\u201d according to New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. The group behind the ventilator has been approached by companies and governments around the world, and plans to license the design of the ventilator for free. While The New York Times notes that the crisis in the city itself appears to be abating, the Spiro Wave should still be helpful in other areas of the country, particularly where there\u2019s a lack of big medical centers.\n\nYou can read The New York Times\u2019 report in full here.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":409,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/23\/21229793\/mcdonalds-mcmuffin-ikea-meatballs-disney-dole-whip-recipes-home-during-coronavirus-quarantine","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-23","author":[],"title":"McDonald\u2019s McMuffin, Ikea meatballs, Disney Dole Whip and more \u2018famous\u2019 recipes to make at home","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/QcdlqtlU_Zuwbrho0NygHJfzrj0=\/0x339:5184x3053\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19915756\/GettyImages_162639610.jpg","body_text":"With amusement parks shuttered and restaurants unable to offer sit-down service because of the coronavirus pandemic, many people may be left in quarantine missing their favorite, one-of-a-kind treats.\n\nLuckily, Ikea, Disney Parks, Cheesecake Factory and several other restaurants are pulling back the curtain on some of their iconic dishes, so people can make them from the comfort of quarantine.\n\nHere are official make-your-own recipes of famous dishes that you can enjoy until it\u2019s safe to venture out for the real thing.\n\nIkea\u2019s famous meatballs\n\nThough many may know IKEA for its home furniture, the company also sells food and beverages in its in-store cafeterias.\n\nIn classic IKEA fashion, the company released its meatball recipe in the form of a construction diagram on Twitter. The directions reveal how to make the meatballs, as well as the \u201ciconic Swedish cream sauce\u201d that accompanies them, for four people.\n\nMissing your IKEA meatball fix?

The following recipe serves four and takes five minutes to prep. (According to a recipe on Dole\u2019s website, the original soft serve is dairy-free, so you may want to opt for dairy-free ice cream to keep your creation authentic.)\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 big scoop of ice cream\n\n4 ounces of pineapple juice\n\n2 cups of frozen pineapple\n\nDirections:\n\nAdd pineapple, ice cream and juice to a blender. Start blending at low speed and increase to high speed. Blend until smooth. Make sure that lid is on tight! Use a piping bag with a star tip to create a classic swirl, or just scoop right into bowls.\n\nDisney Parks churro bites\n\nAnother Disney dessert option is the churro bites served throughout the parks. Here\u2019s how to make them at home, according to the Disney Parks Blog. The recipe serves four.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup water\n\n8 tablespoons butter\n\n\u00bc teaspoon salt\n\n\u00be teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided\n\n1\u00bc cups all-purpose flour\n\n3 eggs\n\n1\u00bd cups vegetable or canola oil\n\n\u00bd cup sugar\n\nDirections:\n\nCombine water, butter, salt and \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon in 1\u00bd-quart saucepan over medium heat.

Grill sandwiches for 2 minutes on each side, until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s McMuffin\n\nThe Disney Parks Blog isn\u2019t the only place people can find famous recipes. McDonald\u2019s UK, which closed all its locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland last month, shared on Twitter how to make a sausage and egg McMuffin.\n\nWant to make the meal creamier while staying true to the original? Use butter instead of liquid margarine. In 2015, the fast-food chain made a key ingredient switch, announcing it would use butter instead of margarine across all its breakfast items. Before then, it had used margarine to toast biscuits and English muffins and to cook eggs.\n\nPanera Bread dishes\n\nPanera Bread also has made several of its recipes available online, including the chain\u2019s Asian almond ramen salad, slow cooker chicken barley soup and game-day chili, among others.\n\nHere\u2019s its recipe for gemelli primavera with shrimp, for four.\n\nIngredients:\n\n12 ounces dried gemelli\n\n\u2153 cup extra virgin olive oil\n\n8 ounces thin asparagus spears, cut into 1-inch lengths on a diagonal\n\n\u00be cup fresh or frozen peas\n\n2 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, thawed if frozen\n\n\u00bd teaspoon salt\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper\n\nZest and juice of \u00bd lemon\n\n\u215b cup Parmesan cheese, plus extra for garnish\n\n4 ounces grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise\n\n\u2153 cup pitted green olives, coarsely chopped\n\n\u00bc cup chopped fresh basil\n\n\u00bd loaf Panera Bread Three Cheese Bread, sliced and toasted\n\nDirections:\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until tender yet chewy, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add asparagus, peas, scallions and garlic, and cook 1 minute. Season shrimp with salt and pepper and add to pan along with lemon zest and juice. Cook until bright pink, 2 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving \u00be cup pasta water. Add pasta and pasta water to pan along with Parmesan, stirring until creamy. Stir in tomatoes, olives and 2 tablespoons of basil. Divide among plates and garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons basil and Parmesan. Serve with toasted Panera Bread Three Cheese Bread. Tip: Gemelli is a twisted short pasta, but you can use any short, shaped pasta for this dish. Try cavatappi, cut fusilli or penne instead.\n\nCheesecake Factory specialties\n\nCheesecake Factory has published recipes online for many of its dishes, including its almond-crusted salmon salad, California guacamole salad and chicken bellagio. Click here to find out how to make these tasty creations and others.\n\nHere\u2019s how to make the restaurant\u2019s Cajun jambalaya pasta for two.\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 ounces olive oil\n\n1 lb. boneless\/skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces\n\n2 Tbls. Cajun spice blend\n\n4 oz. red, yellow, green peppers, cut into thin strips\n\n4 oz. red onions, cut into thin strips\n\n6 oz. shrimp (shells, tails and veins removed)\n\n1 Tbl. blanched garlic, minced\n\n2 tsps. Cajun spice blend\n\n\u00bd tsp. kosher salt\n\n\u00bc tsp. ground black pepper\n\n4 oz. roma tomatoes, diced in 1-inch pieces\n\n1\u00bd cups spicy chicken-seafood broth\n\n1 Tbl. chopped parsley\n\n1 lb. linguini pasta (fresh)\n\nDirections:\n\nHeat the olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan. Place the chicken into a clean mixing bowl. Sprinkle the Cajun spice over the chicken and into the bowl. Gently toss the chicken until each piece is evenly coated with the spice. Add the chicken into the saut\u00e9 pan and cook until it is about half done. Add the peppers, onions and shrimp into the pan. Cook until the shrimp are about half done. Add the garlic into the pan. Season all of the ingredients with kosher salt, ground black pepper and a little more Cajun spice. Add the diced tomatoes and chicken-seafood broth into the saut\u00e9 pan. Gently stir the ingredients together. Continue to cook until the chicken and shrimp are done and the vegetables are tender. Drop the pasta into boiling salted water, and cook until al dente. Place the pasta into serving bowls. Spoon the jambalaya over the pasta. Garnish with a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley.\n\nContributing: Jayme Deerwester\n\nRead more at usatoday.com","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":412,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/city-hall\/2020\/4\/23\/21233384\/coronavirus-chicago-mayor-lightfoot-pandemic-recovery-task-force","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-23","author":"['Fran Spielman']","title":"Lightfoot outlines plan for post-pandemic recovery","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/tDuWa7WhTj_AjkFLWVvJEZDJ0H4=\/0x1957:4008x4055\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19865237\/CV_EMPTYCHICAGO_040220_04.jpg","body_text":"Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Thursday asked a who\u2019s who of Chicago\u2019s movers and shakers to plan for the city\u2019s resurgence after the coronavirus pandemic is finally over.\n\nStanding outside the Water Tower, which survived the Great Chicago Fire, Lightfoot announced a COVID-19 Recovery Task Force co-chaired by the mayor along with her longtime friend Sam Skinner.\n\nSkinner served as White House chief of staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. He is also a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when this crisis will end. \u2026 But what we do know is that, when it comes to recovering from this crisis, there are no half-measures. No cutting corners. \u2026 The crisis we face today is like nothing any of us have ever experienced. \u2026 What we are embarking on is nothing less than the most breathtaking recovery effort our city has ever seen,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nWith the statewide stay-at-home order extended to June 1, Lightfoot acknowledged Chicago is \u201cstill very much in the thick of the fight\u201d and a \u201clong way from being out of the woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we need to plan in a thoughtful, deliberative way about what the future is gonna look like at the neighborhood level, at the block level, but also at the city and the regional level. That\u2019s what this task force is all about: Assessing the damage that\u2019s been done, the harm \u2014 both in economic and \u2026 emotional terms \u2014 and building a framework for us to transition out of stay-at-home when that time is right,\u201d she said.\n\nThe task force the mayor has assembled is a virtual who\u2019s-who of Chicago power brokers.\n\nIt will be divided into five working groups: Policy and Economic Stimulus; Mental and Emotional Health; Marketing and Business Development; Regional Coordination; and Economic Change Study.\n\nThe Regional Coordination group includes Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who was swamped by Lightfoot in the 2019 mayoral runoff and has had a frosty relationship with the mayor ever since.\n\nPreckwinkle applauded Lightfoot for her \u201cstrong leadership\u201d and said it makes sense for a city and county that \u201cshare labor markets and supply chains\u201d to work together.\n\nShe stressed the need for a recovery focused heavily on \u201cthe devastating impact\u201d the virus has had on \u201cblack and brown communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis pandemic has forced millions of people in the region out of their jobs, with the most vulnerable communities being the hardest hit. Small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, gig workers, artists and independent contractors are experiencing unprecedented challenges and many of them are in the fight of their lives to stay operational. Recovery is paramount to all of us now,\u201d Preckwinkle said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for turning things around. But I\u2019m convinced that we can improve our regional outlook through collaborative efforts. Regions with the least inequality perform the best. And for this to happen, we need to work together to drive this change.\u201d\n\nChicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter will serve on a Policy and Economic Stimulus working group that includes Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and vice-chair of World Business Chicago. The Federation of Labor has an ownership stake in Sun-Times Media.\n\nReiter said essential workers on the front lines during the pandemic \u201cneed more than just a \u2018Thank you.\u2019 Working people need an ambitious plan for recovery that will not just return workers to the pre-pandemic status-quo, but strengthen worker protections and shape a new era of prosperity for the working class of Chicago.\u201d\n\nAlexa James, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago, will serve on the working group for Mental and Emotional Health.\n\nShe called the pandemic impact \u201cdeep and complicated\u201d \u2014 even on those who have lost no one they love to the virus and still have jobs and paychecks while working from home.\n\n\u201cNearly everyone can identify with the fear and anxiety caused by the shutdown of our city and our economy. ... There is real grief in peoples\u2019 hearts about what we have lost and what has changed. Whether it\u2019s missing milestones like high school graduations and weddings, financial insecurity and instability \u2014 we are all feeling a tremendous sense of loss,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cThe fears that people may have will continue, even when the stay-at-home order is lifted. Recovering from this crisis won\u2019t be easy. \u2026 We will need to recognize the trauma that the city has faced \u2026 [and] plan a response to the long-term impact this crisis will have on the emotional health of our community.\u201d\n\nAfter introducing the task force, Lightfoot openly acknowledged Chicago Public Schools are planning for at least the possibility that remote learning may need to extend into the fall and the new school year.\n\n\u201cWe know that \u2026 sometime in early 2021 at the earliest before there\u2019s a vaccine. So, we have to be prepared for a lot of different contingencies, including the worst-case contingency,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that our children learn. \u2026 We want to stand up systems and structures now to be prepared, but also to continue to support our young people in particular because this is really, really difficult stuff on them.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":415,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/04\/23\/842706630\/congress-passes-latest-economic-relief-package-to-confront-coronavirus","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-04-23","author":"['Susan Davis', 'Claudia Grisales', 'Kelsey Snell', 'Alana Wise']","title":"Trump Signs Latest Coronavirus Economic Relief Package, Aimed At Small Businesses","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/04\/24\/ap_20115604651951_wide-7bc0f630d80defea29d8d383c24ea89d216d7968.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Trump Signs Latest Coronavirus Economic Relief Package, Aimed At Small Businesses\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci\/AP Evan Vucci\/AP\n\nUpdated at on Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump on Friday signed Congress' latest coronavirus economic relief package, which includes additional aid to small businesses and hospitals.\n\nThe measure passed overwhelmingly in the House on Thursday \u2014 388-5, with one lawmaker voting present.\n\nThe five lawmakers who voted against the package included one Democrat \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2014 and four Republicans \u2014 Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ken Buck of Colorado and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\n\n\"We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill, and I am proud of that,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who made the case for ongoing, robust federal intervention as the only way out of the crisis. Pelosi on Thursday wore a white scarf to cover her face, but lowered it to speak on the House floor.\n\n\"I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibilities and opportunity and results and progress for the American people,\" she said. \"And that science and governance are the answers to meeting the health care needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.\"\n\nThe Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent on Tuesday.\n\nThe details\n\nThe $484 billion package includes an additional $321 billion for the newly created Paycheck Protection Program, a lending program designed to help small businesses stay afloat with forgivable loans during the crisis. PPP was popular and ran out of its initial influx of $350 billion in just two weeks. It is likely the program will need additional funding. Republicans have criticized Democrats for holding up the bill \u2014 initially a stand-alone $250 billion request to fund PPP.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik\/AP\n\nIn the end, Democrats secured an additional $60 billion carved out for smaller banks to assist businesses, many minority-owned, that have struggled to borrow from bigger lenders. It also includes $100 billion Democrats sought for hospitals and more testing.\n\nThey were unsuccessful, however, in their efforts to include additional resources for state and local governments \u2014 a fight they vowed to carry on to the next round of funding talks.\n\n\"There will not be another bill without state and local government\" resources in it,\" Pelosi said on Friday.\n\nSocial distancing during votes\n\nThe House debate on Thursday included stark images reflective of the time: House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow mask, as did most lawmakers and aides who appeared in the chamber. The visitors' galleries, normally open to the public, were closed.\n\nIt was the first roll call vote in the House since it approved a prior coronavirus relief bill on March 14. After that vote, two lawmakers fell ill and about a dozen others self-quarantined as a result. One of those quarantined members, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., later tested positive for COVID-19. House leaders installed more aggressive social distancing guidelines for today's votes.\n\n\"We should be mindful of the people surrounding us,\" said House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is leading an ongoing effort to find ways to allow lawmakers to vote and hold hearings remotely.\n\nLoading...\n\nMembers were directed to vote in smaller groups broken down by alphabetical order for each vote. Between floor speeches and votes, lawmakers were asked to stay in their offices. And members were asked to vote by machine and not a manual card that requires more contact. Short recesses were held between debates and votes to clean the chamber.\n\nThe pandemic also continues to affect lawmakers personally. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., announced on the House floor that her sister is hospitalized with COVID-19. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that her eldest brother died from the virus on Tuesday.\n\nNext up\n\nThis is the fourth measure Congress has approved since March 1 to confront coronavirus and the economic fallout. While all four enjoyed fast, bipartisan support, there are signals that the parties are retreating to more familiar partisan lines for an anticipated fifth package.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants a \"pause\" before Congress considers additional legislation, and that it is unlikely additional measures will be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent, which is generally reserved for noncontroversial bills. He has also indicated he will oppose any no-strings-attached funding for states and that he supports a new legal channel for states to declare bankruptcy to address their fiscal woes.\n\nAmong the measures Congress is expected to debate for inclusion in future legislation is funding for state and local governments to make up for budget shortfalls, additional cash payments to American workers and families, extended unemployment benefits, aid for the U.S. Postal Service and first responders, and new infrastructure spending.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":416,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/23\/21232880\/cta-metra-covid-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-mass-transit-chicago-jon-hilkevitch","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-23","author":[],"title":"Chicago\u2019s \u2018crush hour\u2019 may take a new turn, but COVID-19 is not CTA or Metra\u2019s death knell","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/A0qggfm7IIWpwIrKdjthu2n_16s=\/0x0:3715x1945\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19920074\/CV_EMPTYCHICAGO_032520_13.jpg","body_text":"In a very different time only a decade ago, safeguarding public health wasn\u2019t a major consideration when the Chicago Transit Authority removed all the seats on two cars of some rush-hour L trains in order to stuff more riders, cheek by jowl, aboard its cattle cars.\n\nAfter that experiment to boost passenger capacity failed to sit well with commuters, the CTA introduced new rail cars outfitted mostly with center-facing seats to accommodate the crush-loading of cars to as many as 120 people. Such close contact was well above the goal of a later \u201cde-crowding\u2019\u2019 initiative aimed at reducing human freight to 70 to 75 people per car on average.\n\nOpinion\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether anything resembling the tin-of-sardines transit experience will ever return in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing. But I don\u2019t know how you take the mass out of mass transit.\n\nAmidst staggering losses currently at the farebox that may take years to recover from, it now appears that the pre-pandemic challenges to accommodate the ridership gains of years\u2019 past were a good problem for the CTA, and Metra, to have.\n\nUntil now, transportation, and particularly mass transit, were considered part of the go-to solution to deal with just about any catastrophe. Downtown Chicago was evacuated in short order after the terrorist attacks on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nYet when the reality finally set in late this winter about the lethal threat posed by the novel coronavirus, health officials across the country issued a proclamation that previously seemed unimaginable: The public, except for essential workers including medical and safety personnel commuting to their jobs, should stay off trains and buses until further notice.\n\nTransit ridership has plunged since Illinois\u2019 stay-at-home order took effect on March 21. The few people still riding have posted photos on social media showing them having entire train coaches and buses almost all to themselves. Transit officials have tried, meanwhile, to reassure these diehard customers that seats, grab poles and hanging straps are being wiped down daily to minimize the spread of disease.\n\nCTA ridership has plunged about 80 percent since Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s stay-at-home order. Metra ridership is in an even bigger free-fall, projected to be down 97 percent in April compared with the same month a year ago, officials said.\n\n\u201cCommuter rail will not be the same after COVID-19,\u201d Tom Farmer, Metra\u2019s chief financial officer, told the Metra board during an online meeting on April 15. \u201cWe have just been crushed.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a transit doomsday warning that far exceeds Chicago-area transit agencies\u2019 cries for financial help in the early 2000s. A CTA budget shortfall in 2009 led the transit agency to impose service cuts in 2010 on more than 100 bus routes and seven rail lines. The drastic schedule changes prompted commuters to make new travel choices. But they eventually circled back to their preferred method of getting around this congested region. By 2012, CTA ridership reached its highest level in 22 years, adding some 13 million rides compared to 2011.\n\nBefore the ongoing public health emergency, the Chicago region\u2019s transit agencies were already weighed down by a backlog of infrastructure improvement needs totaling billions of dollars. The formidable burdens, new and old, will not fade without concerted action at the local, state and federal levels and an openness to trying new ideas.\n\nBut instead of joining Metra\u2019s gloomy long-term outlook for public transit, I\u2019m reminded about a cable that Mark Twain sent from London to the press in the United States after the mistaken publication of his obituary: \u201cReports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\u2019\u2019\n\nJon Hilkevitch teaches journalism at DePaul University in Chicago.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":420,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/24\/21234936\/amazon-wage-increase-warehouse-worker-coronavirus-covid","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-24","author":"['Nick Statt']","title":"Amazon extends hourly wage increase for warehouse workers through May 16th","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/fhTpM7RsSd5QYNKxgAePu6s5uWA=\/0x146:2040x1214\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/13443464\/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.jpg","body_text":"Amazon is extending its increase in the hourly pay rate of warehouse workers through May 16th, according to a report from CNBC.

Now, Amazon is extending the pay bump to help incentivize workers to continue staffing its warehouses and its grocery and package delivery platforms.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson tells CNBC. According to the report, Amazon is currently employing more than 250,000 fulfillment center workers across 110 facilities in the US alone.\n\nDespite these added benefits, Amazon has faced fierce criticism for its handling of health and safety issues during COVID-19. Employees have complained of warehouses remaining open despite workers testing positive for the virus, and Amazon has also been accused of failing to notify employees when they may have come into contact with co-workers who later test positive.\n\nA warehouse worker strike in New York City last month drew national headlines after Amazon fired one of its organizers, claiming he was violating self-isolation guidelines. Leaked documents later revealed Amazon executives\u2019 plans to smear the organizer, Chris Smalls, to discredit the growing labor movement within the company.\n\nEarlier this month, the first Amazon warehouse worker died of COVID-19, and since the Smalls incident, Amazon has fired both corporate employees and other warehouse workers, in what activists and the employees affected say is retaliation for speaking out about the company\u2019s handling of safety issues during the pandemic. The National Labor Relations Board is now looking into whether Amazon is violating its employees\u2019 rights. And today, Amazon tech workers are calling in sick to protest the company\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe support every employee\u2019s right to criticize their employer\u2019s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson tells The Verge with regard to its termination of corporate employees. In relation to warehouse workers it has fired, the company also says the rights it affords to employee to protest \u201cdo not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.\u201d\n\nUpdate April 27th, 6:19PM ET: Added statements from Amazon.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":433,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/24\/21235025\/coronavirus-deaths-illinois-nursing-homes","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-24","author":"['Jon Seidel', 'Tina Sfondeles']","title":"Coronavirus deaths more than double at Illinois nursing homes, data shows","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/POu2cFT4fl9k8zjwdNnUaTDgCIA=\/0x66:920x548\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19923174\/symphony_south_shore_2425_E._71st_St.0.jpg","body_text":"The state\u2019s count of coronavirus cases and deaths in long-term care facilities has more than doubled, according to numbers published Friday after a major nursing-home operator\u2019s CEO warned they would reflect a \u201csurge in new cases and more heartbreaking deaths.\u201d\n\nBut the numbers, published weekly, appear to be a lagging indicator of what is actually happening around the state \u2014 meaning the actual count could be higher. For example, one South Side nursing home has publicized far higher numbers than reported by the state Friday. A spokeswoman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the numbers released earlier by the individual nursing homes are reliable.\n\nThe new numbers reflect 4,298 coronavirus cases and 625 deaths in nursing homes across the state, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Pritzker\u2019s office first released nursing home numbers last week, which showed 1,860 residents and staff members had tested positive. Of those, 286 had died.\n\n\u201cIt should not come as a surprise to anyone,\u201d Citadel Healthcare CEO Jonathan Aaron said during an online press conference Friday. \u201cBecause the state expanded testing this week, and some operators also partnered with hospitals to test every resident and every employee.\u201d\n\nAaron warned the state\u2019s new numbers would reflect a surge. But he also called the state\u2019s data \u201ca limited snapshot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis virus moves silently and more quickly than we can, making data outdated even at the time of posting,\u201d said Aaron, whose organization is also a member of the Health Care Council of Illinois.\n\nThe state says it is gathering data on long-term care facilities on a rolling basis from two national databases, with a slight lag in the numbers that hit its website. Aaron also acknowledged \u201creasonable delays in reporting,\u201d given the rapid spread of the virus. But he said Citadel Healthcare is following the state\u2019s reporting requirements.\n\nSymphony Care Network spokeswoman Natalie Bauer Luce said earlier this week that 111 residents at Symphony South Shore had contracted the coronavirus, and 10 residents there had died from the disease. But the state\u2019s numbers released Friday only show that the facility had 35 coronavirus cases and two deaths.\n\nLuce said earlier this week that long-term care facilities are required to notify the state and local health departments upon the diagnosis of a resident or staff member. Aaron said Citadel reports every case within 12 hours.\n\nThe numbers released Friday would indicate more than a third of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois are tied to senior facilities, up from a quarter of all deaths last week. Though Aaron said the state\u2019s testing at nursing homes is \u201cdeeply appreciated,\u201d he called it belated and \u201coff to a slow start.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge the state to shift to rapid-response, mobile laboratories operated by the National Guard,\u201d Aaron said, adding, \u201cour residents deserve coordinated widespread testing.\u201d\n\nPritzker at his daily briefing Friday said testing residents and staff at nursing homes is a top priority for the state.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":442,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/26\/21237700\/south-side-lgbtq-pride-festival-moves-online-amid-covid-19-concerns","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-26","author":"['Jake Wittich']","title":"South Side LGBTQ pride festival moves online amid COVID-19 concerns","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/jofXxnL9cdylYxaKmz5DGuaGSmg=\/29x0:1110x566\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19927042\/Roy_Kinsey_2.png","body_text":"Organizers of Pride South Side are bringing Chicago\u2019s first-ever South Side-based LGBTQ pride festival online this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe inaugural Pride South Side Festival in 2019 sought to create \u201csustainable spaces for queer youth of color on the South Side\u201d with a series of events spanning five South Side neighborhoods, but organizers said they started pivoting to an online celebration for its second year when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Chicago area.\n\nNow, they\u2019re launching an online hub for LGBTQ people of color to share artwork, as well as a two-month-long campaign encouraging LGBTQ South and West siders to complete the 2020 Census.\n\n\u201cIn the time of social distancing, so many folks who already exist at the margins can be pushed even further into isolation, putting the mental health and well-being of our community into jeopardy,\u201d said Dio Aldridge, director of program development for Pride South Side. \u201cWhat our team set out to do is create a safe, affirming and entertaining online space that serves as a platform for black, queer or Latinx artists and content creators from the South and West sides of Chicago.\u201d\n\nAldridge said this year\u2019s campaign will focus on the same goals outlined at last year\u2019s festival: to create space for LGBTQ people outside of the North Side, promote health and wellness and support their local economy.\n\nIn a video promoting Pride South Side\u2019s campaign, participating artists explain how census participation can benefit LGBTQ South Siders.\n\n\u201cWhat the census hopes to provide is to get a sort of idea what your population is looking like, so you can better understand how to allocate resources,\u201d one artist says.\n\nResults from the 2020 Census will affect how federal funding is allocated each year.\n\nPride South Side has partnered with Chicago-based LGBTQ artists Vicki Street, DJ Doza the God, Roy Kinsey, Melli Domo and Kelsey Stone to provide Chicagoans with new artwork and resources every day from May 1 through June 30, which is the end of LGBTQ Pride Month.\n\nThe group, which now also partners with the 2020 Census and the Illinois Department of Human Services, hopes to reach at least 6,000 people through its online campaign and raise at least $100,000 in sales for local LGBTQ artists and the Brave Space Alliance, a South Side LGBTQ Center that\u2019s launched a COVID-19 food delivery drive.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing short of amazing how our team has come together and the artist community we\u2019ve been able to cultivate for this project. We are hype and ready for what\u2019s to come,\u201d Aldridge said.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the city\u2019s annual LGBTQ Pride Parade and festival were postponed until the fall due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nTim Frye, coordinator of the 2020 parade, said the event will either be rescheduled until the fall or return in 2021 and \u201cfor years to come.\u201d\n\nBoystown\u2019s annual Pride Fest, held by the Northalsted Business Alliance, is now scheduled for Sept. 5 and 6 instead of June 20 and 21.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":443,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/us-military-army-readiness-coronavirus-60-minutes-2020-04-26\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-04-26","author":"['David Martin']","title":"Fighting an unseen enemy: How the military is protecting itself from the coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/04\/26\/5495b3f8-4afa-4797-b9f9-854c5634e2f3\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/78304ba62f9a7d4a876ad45f5f04585e\/militaryarticle.jpg","body_text":"Anyone joining the United States military takes an oath to defend the country against all enemies foreign and domestic. Safe to say very few of them had coronavirus in mind when they raised their right hand. By latest count, some 60,000 servicemen and women have been sent into action against this new enemy. But the military's number one mission has been to defend its own ranks against infection. It can't protect the nation if it can't defend itself. The aircraft carrier Roosevelt made headlines when the coronavirus ran roughshod through its crew. And there have been other outbreaks that required drastic measures to contain. The U.S. military was up against an enemy it could not see and did not understand.\n\nEverything in the Army starts with basic training. And every day starts before dawn. But it never looked or sounded like this before.\n\nDrill Sergeant David Castelow gives instructions for cleaning to prevent coronavirus. CBS News\n\nDrill Sergeant David Castelow: Hard surfaces. Everything that your little hands touch. Everything! It's gotta get wiped down. Your beds \u2013 everything! If it's a hard surface it collects dust. You're gonna wipe it down. Do you understand?\n\nRECRUITS: Yes, Drill Sergent!\n\nIt's not dust Drill Sergeant David Castelow is worried about. It's coronavirus. And that's why he takes every recruit's temperature first thing.\n\nDrill Sergeant David Castelow: If your organization is infected by something like this, you know, these people, these initial entry trainees, are our combat power. So if they go down, or and if we can't do it safely, then we are rendering ourselves obsolete.\n\nCoronavirus pandemic tests U.S. military planning\n\nLast month, 63 recruits in a class of 940 here at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, tested positive for the virus and upended basic training.\n\nDrill Sergeant Porter: You're going to do everything that I tell you. You do not move unless I tell you to.\n\nThat's not a recruit he's barking at. It's a four-star general, Army Chief of Staff James McConville.\n\nArmy Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville (right) goes back to basic training.\n\nMcConville took on the role of a recruit to witness the revamped training first hand after the coronavirus had forced the Army to stop taking in new soldiers.\n\nGen. James McConville: We took a two week pause.\n\nDavid Martin: So for two weeks, you're not taking in any recruits?\n\nGen. James McConville: That's correct.\n\nDavid Martin: Has that ever happened before?\n\nGen. James McConville: I'm not aware of any time \u2013 at least, in my 39 years where we stopped taking recruits in. But these are different times.\n\nTraining is still going on at Fort Jackson for recruits who arrived before the two-week pause. But now every soldier is wearing a face mask, loading up on hand sanitizer before moving into firing position and trying to stay six feet apart.\n\nWe call it \"social distancing.\" The Army calls it \"tacticial dispersion.\"\n\nLt. Col. Patrick Collins: We have been executing socially distanced enabled training since week 2.\n\n\n\nEither way, Lt. Col. Patrick Collins tells Gen. McConville it's a problem.\n\nLt. Col. Patrick Collins: Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet. Because, you tend to tell them, \"O.K. separate. Get your six feet.\" You know, a couple minutes later, you know, just kind of natural human behavior. They start clustering again and you, and you, you've gotta tell them again.\n\nGen. James McConville\n\nNothing at Fort Jackson is natural anymore. The Army likes to say it has the best dressed soldiers in the world, but tailors who usually alter uniforms for a better fit are now turning out face masks.\n\nGen. James McConville: These just got here. These are brand new.\n\nDavid Martin: Brand new?\n\nAnd the single most important equipment McConville saw on his tour was a pair of high-speed COVID-19 test machines.\n\nCol. Koenig: That'd give us the ability to test 750-plus in one day with a one-day turnaround. And then they go and we can then test that bubble also. We can continue to expand the bubbles of testing so that we can make sure we can cut it off right at the source, rather than watch it spread through a unit.\n\nThe chief of staff's job is to get the Army ready to fight. But these days, Gen. McConville told us he spends three quarters of his time trying to fight coronavirus to keep his soldiers healthy. Just six weeks ago he was sending heavy armor to Europe for one of the largest exercises since the Cold War.\n\nGen. James McConville: The toughest decision that-- that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20.\n\nDefender 20 meant sending an entire division-sized force and its equipment to Europe, just as the virus was assaulting the continent.\n\nGen. James McConville: We just started war-gaming what would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 soldiers in a very close environment and, you know, and the virus broke out? How would we take care of them? And did we want to put our soldiers at that much risk for a training exercise? And we chose not to.\n\nDavid Martin: You have to curtail training. You have to postpone major exercises. That's got to take a toll on the readiness of the Army.\n\nGen. James McConville: From where I sit, I'm looking at the long game, and the long game is that we have to protect the force to protect the nation.\n\nDavid Martin: How big a price have you paid so far?\n\nGen. James McConville: I don't think we've paid a huge price yet. Am I concerned long term? Absolutely.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I'll be honest. It's been a little bit intimidating thinking about it. You train in your career to fight an enemy that you can see. This is one that you can't.\n\nAir Force Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler, a fighter pilot, is about as far removed from basic training as it gets, underneath 1,500 feet of granite at this command post inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is a secure location that we intend to operate out of in wartime.\n\nDavid Martin: Well, this is wartime, isn't it?\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is, but it's really a different kind of war.\n\nCheyenne Mountain was built to withstand a nuclear blast but every time a watch team makes this half-mile walk into the mountain, they risk bringing the virus with them. Which is why each team spends 14 days in quarantine before going on duty. When their watch starts.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: The first step you do is you start wiping down every surface, your computers, your telephones, your desk surfaces, door handles, etc. to make sure that all those are clean as well. It's a bit like an obsessive compulsive disorder (laugh). But we have to be able to make sure that there's no exposure to that virus.\n\nBecause our 60 Minutes team had not been quarantined, our cameras were not allowed inside the mountain. This footage was shot by the military. The interview was conducted from the Pentagon.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: When occasionally we have to bring somebody from outside into our bubble for work on an IT system, for example, we scatter like cockroaches. It's as if this is the most dangerous thing we've ever done in our careers. It's not being shot at. It's not flying combat. It's actually having somebody from outside the bubble arrive inside of here.\n\nThe command center at Cheyenne Mountain\n\nThis command center performs what Fesler calls a zero-fail mission: a 24\/7 watch against a missile or bomber attack on the United States. Since the pandemic began, Cheyenne Mountain has scrambled jets to intercept Russian aircraft off the coast of Alaska three times.\n\nDavid Martin: You think they were testing you at all to see if anybody was home at Cheyenne Mountain.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I suspect that the way that they look at those sorties probably is related to understanding our ability to operate in a COVID environment.\n\nCheyenne Mountain was ready for the Russians but not for the coronavirus.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: This is something new. This is something that we had to invent on the fly as our adversary was not exactly like the one we had planned to fight.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: There are so many aspects of what's going on now that are not things that we expected that we would be doing.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of the U.S. Northern Command, is the man in charge of defending the homeland. He had plans for dealing with all kinds of disasters, including a pandemic, but nothing on this scale.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Often we practice what we call the complex disasters, where we might have an earthquake, maybe, that hit multiple states and we consider those to be complex. And to have a national-- actual disasters declared in the 50 states and the responses happening with them, that is unprecedented.\n\nDavid Martin: So, you know the old saying about plans, no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.\n\nDespite all the top secret intelligence he sees, O'Shaughnessy did not have a good understanding of the virus.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.\n\nGen. John Hyten: We still don't fully understand the virus.\n\nGen. John Hyten\n\nGen. John Hyten is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the number two man in the military. Twice each day he holds a video conference with the pentagon's crisis management team located two floors below in the national military command center.\n\nGen. John Hyten: We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do, what a pandemic flu would do. And then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.\n\nThe nastiest surprise was the aircraft carrier Roosevelt. Not only did the virus sideline one of the most important ships in the Navy but the majority of the more than 800 crew members who tested positive had no symptoms.\n\nGen. John Hyten: You think you finally start to understand it, and then you get data off the Theodore Roosevelt, of the very large number of asymptomatic cases. And then you try to understand whether the asymptomatic cases are contagious. How contagious are they? That's medical questions that we still don't fully understand the answers to.\n\nMany of the answers depended on testing and the Pentagon had to use its transport planes to airlift millions of test swabs into the United States from Europe.\n\nDavid Martin: From the outside looking in, it seemed like it was one emergency stopgap shipment of medical supplies after another. Was that what it was like on the inside looking out?\n\nGen. John Hyten: On the inside looking out I'll say it didn't look like an emergency but it was difficult. It was difficult to figure out exactly where to go. And then when we decided to move-- we had to move quickly to get it in the right place. But the one thing that we do really well is we move stuff.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers set up hospitals like this one at Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center all across the country, creating by last count about 15,000 beds in case local hospitals were overwhelmed.\n\nDavid Martin: Were those hospitals the last line of defense?\n\nGen. John Hyten: We looked at it as the last line of defense.\n\nDavid Martin: Where would the medical personnel to staff all those beds come from?\n\nGen. John Hyten: I have to be honest, we were worried about whether we'd run outta capacity early on when we were lookin' at those big numbers. It was not just space but, we were worried about doctors, nurses, corpsmen, respiratory therapists. We were worried about all those things.\n\nDavid Martin: If this virus had not been slowed by social distancing, would the U.S. military have had the capability and capacity to defeat that virus?\n\nGen. John Hyten: That's what we were worried about. A situation where we woulda been basically mobilizing everything we had. It would been a different world. And I can't tell you right now how we woulda closed that.\n\nIt's a question the American military rarely has to ask itself, but the definition of what it takes to be a superpower has changed forever.\n\nDavid Martin: So what will it take to get the military back to normal?\n\nGen. John Hyten: 2019 normal will never exist again. We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists. If we just wait for what, you know, everybody hopes is gonna happen, which is the disease goes away, and it doesn't, and we haven't planned for the-- for the other case, we're in a bad situation.\n\nProduced by Mary Walsh.

A little-known band of doctors and hi-tech wizards say they were able to find the vital speed needed to attack the coronavirus: the computing power of artificial intelligence. They call their new weapon \"outbreak science.\" It could change the way we fight another contagion. Already it has led to calls for an overhaul of how the federal government does things. But first, we'll take you inside BlueDot, a small Canadian company with an algorithm that scours the world for outbreaks of infectious disease. It's a digital early warning system, and it was among the first to raise alarms about this lethal outbreak.\n\nIt was New Year's Eve when BlueDot's computer spat out an alert: a Chinese business paper had just reported 27 cases of a mysterious flu-like disease in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The signs were ominous. Seven people were already in hospitals.\n\nAlmost all the cases came from the city's sprawling market, where live animals are packed in cages and slaughtered on-site. Medical detectives are now investigating if this is where the epidemic began, when the virus made the leap from animals to us.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan\n\nHalf a world away on the Toronto waterfront, BlueDot's founder and CEO, Dr. Kamran Khan, was on his way to work. An infectious disease physician, he had seen another coronavirus in 2003 \u2013 SARS \u2013 kill three colleagues. When we spoke with him remotely he told us this outbreak had him worried.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: We did not know that this would become the next pandemic. But we did know that there were echoes of the SARS outbreak, and it was something that we really should be paying attention to.\n\nCOVID-19 soon got the world's attention. BlueDot's Toronto staff now works from home, except for Dr. Khan. But in December, the office kicked into high-gear as they rushed to verify the alert.\n\nChinese officials were secretive about what was happening. But BlueDot's computer doesn't rely on official statements. Their algorithm was already churning through data, including medical bulletins, even livestock reports, to predict where the virus would go next.\n\nIt was also scanning the ticket data from 4,000 airports.\n\nBlueDot wasn't just tracking flights, but calculating the cities at greatest risk. On December 31, there were more than 800,000 travellers leaving Wuhan, some likely carrying the disease.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: So these yellow lines reflect the nonstop flights going out of Wuhan. And then the blue circles reflect the final destinations of travelers. The larger the circle, the larger number of travelers who are going to that location. These were many of the first cities that actually received cases of COVID-19 as it spread out of mainland China.\n\nBill Whitaker: You can do that in a matter of seconds?\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: We can analyze and visualize all this information across the globe in just a few seconds.\n\nThe virus wasn't just spreading to east Asia. Thousands of travelers were heading to the United States too.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: Most of the travel came into California and San Francisco and Los Angeles. Uh, also, into New York City. And we analyzed that way back on December 31. Our surveillance system that picked up the outbreak of Wuhan automatically talks to the system that is looking at how travelers might go to various airports around Wuhan.\n\nBill Whitaker: So when you see that map, you don't just see flight patterns?\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: If you think of an outbreak a bit like a fire and embers flying off, these are like embers flying off into different locations.\n\nBill Whitaker: So in this case, that ember landed in dry brush in New York and started a wildfire?\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: Absolutely.\n\nDr. Khan told us he had spent the better part of a year persuading the airlines to share their flight data for public health. Nobody had ever asked that before. But he saw it as information gold.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: How is it that someone knows 16B - that seat is available, but 14A has been taken? There clearly must be some kind of information system.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why is that so important?\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: There are over 4 billion of us that board commercial flights and travel around the world every year. And so that is why understanding population movements becomes so important in anticipating how disease is spread.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan\n\nThe virus spread across Asia with a vengeance. BlueDot has licensed access to the anonymized location data from millions of cellphones. And with that data it identified 12 of the 20 cities that would suffer first.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: What we're looking at here are mobile devices that were in Wuhan in the previous 14 days and where are they now across East Asia. Places like Tokyo have a lot of devices, Seoul in South Korea--\n\nBill Whitaker: So you're following those devices from Wuhan to these other cities?\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: That's correct. I do wanna point out these are also anonymized data. But they allow us to understand population movements. That is how we can understand how this virus will spread.\n\nTo build their algorithm, Dr. Khan told us he deliberately hired an eclectic mix: engineers, ecologists, geographers, veterinarians all under one roof. They spent a year teaching the computer to detect 150 deadly pathogens.\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: We can ultimately train a machine to be reading through all the text and picking out components that this is talking about an outbreak of anthrax and this is talking about the heavy metal band Anthrax. And as you do this thousands and thousands and thousands of times, the machine starts to get smarter and smarter.\n\nBill Whitaker: And how many different languages does the computer understand?\n\nDr. Kamran Khan: So it's reading this currently in 65 languages, and processing this information every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. So it's a lotta data to go through.\n\nWithin two hours of detecting the outbreak on December 31, BlueDot had sent a warning of the potential threat to its clients: public health officials in 12 countries, airlines and frontline hospitals, like Humber River in Toronto.\n\nDr. Michael Gardam: We've been able to really make a lot of decisions, I think, a little bit earlier 'cause I kinda feel like we had a bit of an inside scoop here.\n\nOne of Canada's top infectious disease physicians, Dr. Michael Gardam, told us it was like getting real time intelligence.\n\nBill Whitaker: What did you do when you got that information from BlueDot?\n\nDr. Michael Gardam: Getting that intel allowed me to kinda be the canary in the coal mine, to stand up and say we need to pay attention to this. And to start thinking about it, start thinking about supplies, start thinking about how busy we might be.\n\nDr. Michael Gardam\n\nDr. Michael Gardam: Now at this point, everybody knows about CoVid-19. But it's, it's not so much now. Now you've pretty much bought whatever PPE you can buy, it's very hard to buy that anymore. It's what did you do a month and a half ago that was so important. So, none of this is any surprise to us whatsoever, and yet, you see countries around the world where this has been a surprise.\n\nBlueDot had no clients in the U.S., so while Dr. Gardam's hospital was making plans in January, President Trump, as late as March, was still assuring Americans that everything was under control.\n\nCalifornia wasn't so sure, and braced for the worst. In March, it became the first state in the country to lock down its cities. Mickey Mouse suddenly looked lonely, drivers had only dreamed of such empty freeways. But the lock-down bought time. Despite having its first case of COVID-19 five weeks before New York, California dodged the hurricane of infection that slammed into New York City. At his daily teleconference in Sacramento, Governor Gavin Newsom made no secret where he'd gotten his edge: outbreak science.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom\n\nGavin Newsom: It's not a gross exaggeration when I say this \u2013 the old modeling is literally pen\u2013to-paper in some cases. And then you put it into some modest little computer program and it spits a piece of paper out. I mean, this is a whole other level of sophistication and data collection.\n\nWith the virus spreading around the world, California enlisted the help of BlueDot, Esri, Facebook and others, using mapping technologies and cell phone data to predict which hospitals would be hit hardest, and see if Californians were really staying at home. Data became California's all-seeing crystal ball.\n\nGavin Newsom: We are literally seeing in to the future and predicting in real-time based on constant update of information where patterns are starting to occur before they become headlines.\n\nBill Whitaker: Can you just sort of like, give me an example?\n\nGavin Newsom: We can see in real time on a daily basis, hourly basis, moment-by-moment basis if necessary, whether or not our stay-at-home orders were working. We can truly track now by census tract, not just by county.\n\nHere's what it looked like. BlueDot scanned anonymous cell phone data over a 24-hour period last month in Los Angeles. The blue circles indicate less movement than the week before, the red spots show where people are still gathering. It could be a hospital \u2013 or a problem. That cellphone data allows public health officials to investigate. It also raises worrisome privacy issues.\n\nBill Whitaker: How are you able to ensure that this cell phone data will remain anonymous?\n\nGavin Newsom: Well, I didn't want to take the companies' words for it, I say that respectfully. I have a team of folks that are privacy-first advocates in our Technology Department. And we are making sure that no individualized data is provided. If it is, we're out.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what's been the most frustrating part of this for you?\n\nGavin Newsom: It's just incumbent upon us to have a national lens. And to recognize we're\n\nmany parts but one body. And if one part suffers, we all suffer.\n\nBill Whitaker: From this experience, do you think the Federal Government needs to overhaul the way it tackles pandemics?\n\nGavin Newsom: I don't know that there's a human being out there, maybe one or two, that would suggest otherwise. No, the absolute answer is, of course, unequivocally.\n\nDylan George: Data technology has transformed the way we do business in many aspects of our lives. But it has not transformed the way things are done in public health.\n\nDylan George\n\nFor Dylan George that's an urgent priority. As a scientist tracking biological threats in the Bush and Obama administrations, he has seen first-hand what he calls the panic-neglect cycle.\n\nDylan George: Perhaps the most tragic idea in all of public health is this: in a time of an outbreak everyone lights their hair on fire and is running around trying to figure out. After it's over, everyone forgets about it\n\nHe has joined a growing number of scientists pressing to revive an old idea: an infectious disease forecasting center modeled on the National Weather Service.\n\nDylan George: We need to have professionals that their day job is dedicated to helping us understand how infectious diseases will-- will risk our well being economically and from a national security perspective.\n\nBill Whitaker: That idea has been kicking around for a while. It's never gotten the funding. Do you think things will be different this time?\n\nDylan George: When we see that there is $2 trillion being spent on stimulus bills to help us get out of this, to make sure that we can rebound, we need to think transformatively. We need to think broadly about how we can move these things forward. This kind of a center would help us do that.\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to upend our lives, Toronto's Dr. Michael Gardam told us he has seen the difference a digital early-warning system can make.\n\nDr. Michael Gardam: One of the biggest challenges in infectious diseases is you never wanna be the doctor that picks up the first case because you're probably going to miss it. And you probably weren't wearing the right gear and it's probably already spread in your hospital. And so getting the early warning that help gives you the intel to make that first call is so incredibly important.\n\nProduced by Heather Abbott. Associate producer, David M. Levine.

Since the pandemic took hold in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has relaxed fuel economy standards \u2014 a decision that will lead to more emissions from tailpipes. It also weakened a rule meant to keep mercury pollution in check, which could make it harder to regulate other toxins, too. And in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic unfolding, the EPA announced in March that it \u201cdoes not expect\u201d to penalize polluters for a broad range of violations related to routine monitoring and reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cNo shame. I don\u2019t know how else to put it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just seem to have no, I don\u2019t know \u2014 no shame. I don\u2019t know how else to put it,\u201d says former EPA administrator during the Obama administration, Gina McCarthy, who now heads the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe Verge spoke with McCarthy about what impact the coronavirus crisis is having on people and our environment now and into the future.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat effects do you see the COVID-19 crisis having on the environment?\n\nOne of the things that I think people now realize after COVID-19 is just how small the world is, how we can be so immediately devastated worldwide by a public health threat, and how important it is for us to think about that and its application to other worldwide concerns like climate change. Obviously, our reactions to COVID-19 have led to some significant behavioral changes and adaptations that we had to make. And some of those may continue to have an influence into the future. It just shows you that in a moment of crisis, the world can, people can change their behavior.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way you want to see pollution to be reduced.\u201d\n\nBut certainly, this isn\u2019t the way you want to see pollution to be reduced. A path to a more sustainable future isn\u2019t to react and adapt in these immediate ways that also diminish our ability to have a strong economy and keep people working.\n\nThere has been a lot of attention on how air quality has improved as a result of stay-at-home orders. What, if any, takeaways we can gather from that?\n\nNumber one is that people begin to see the impact human beings actually have on the environment. When you have a country like India where much of the population are seeing the Himalayas for the first time, that\u2019s pretty shocking. When you\u2019re seeing that kind of reduction, not just in air pollution but in water pollution, like looking at Venice and looking at the canals and they don\u2019t look horrible anymore. The sediment isn\u2019t churning, and they\u2019re not black and brown. And so people are beginning to recognize that we do have an influence on the world in a way that could end up resulting in systemic change.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways for me has been that people are wondering why African Americans are getting hit so much harder by COVID-19 in terms of the number of deaths that are happening compared to the percentage of the population. That\u2019s not at all shocking to anybody who does public health work because it\u2019s always been true that people of color in low-income communities are hit hardest because they always are facing the highest levels of pollution, the lowest levels of services like fresh food and health services. And so, if there\u2019s anything that comes out of this that\u2019s positive, maybe it\u2019s an understanding that the world is unfair right now and climate change is going to make it continually inequitable.\n\nIf we look at who\u2019s losing their lives to COVID-19 in larger numbers, it\u2019s the same people that have been facing the air pollution that\u2019s been impacting their lungs that may make them predisposed to being harmed by pollution. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so unconscionable to me that this administration at this point in time is doing everything they can think of to make pollution standards weakened and to roll back their ability to be able to control pollution from industries that are operating even today. It\u2019s just shocking to me because this just means it\u2019s a callous disregard for the communities that have been left behind. It\u2019s a callous acknowledgment that they care less about people who are in poverty and people who are of communities of color than they do the people that are trying to benefit through stimulus dollars \u2014 which is those who are already rich and are already powerful. It just shocks me that it could be so blatant.\n\n\u201ca callous disregard for the communities that have been left behind\u201d\n\nThe decision the EPA made to relax its oversight of polluters during the pandemic shocked a lot of people who worry that it gives a break to powerful, polluting industries. What are your thoughts on what effect that decision might have on people?\n\nThe \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy looks sort of reasonable on its face but has no limits. It basically says if COVID-19 is presenting any problem to you, then it gives you an excuse for not monitoring and reporting. And it specifically says that the EPA will not initiate penalties in those circumstances, and it doesn\u2019t require the industries themselves to basically tell them in advance that they\u2019re having problems so that the agency itself can monitor whether it\u2019s legitimate or not. And most importantly, let the communities around them know that there may be opportunities to increase pollution that directly impact their ability to monitor their own health.\n\nSo, the very industries that have caused all of these predispositions for human beings who live in the shadows of these facilities to health consequences [and] to having greater impacts from COVID-19, these industries are the ones that could take advantage of this policy. They could be sending more pollution their way that makes them dramatically more unable to cope against the challenge of COVID-19. And so this is an unlimited get-out-of-jail-free card with no end in sight. And they did it with the full understanding that people wouldn\u2019t be able to know what was happening or protect themselves.\n\n\u201cAn unlimited get-out-of-jail-free card with no end in sight\u201d\n\nI read it, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Nobody has ever done any rule that provided this breadth of leeway to industries in the middle of a crisis that impacts lungs where people die if they don\u2019t have clean air to breathe.\n\nWe\u2019re also facing the economic fallout of the pandemic. What could a recession mean for environmental protection in the US?\n\nWhat it would mean for an administration that has real integrity here and is doing its mission. It would mean that you put people back to work. You use the stimulus dollars as an opportunity to help those most in need. And then you hopefully look at, \u201cSo what does the future look like?\u201d If I\u2019m investing trillions of dollars, how do we do that in a way that builds a better future? So it ought to acknowledge that we have air pollution challenges that are keeping communities of color and low-income people at higher risk of all kinds of ailments, including COVID-19. They should put in place economic benefits to those communities so that they can address some of the income inequality we face. They should be looking forward and investing in clean energy jobs. They should be putting people to work in infrastructure that is necessary today for our water, for our sewer, for our adaptation challenges to climate change now.\n\nThere are so many ways in which they could look at this as building the next economy that doesn\u2019t continue to rely on fossil fuels as the future. And instead, my fear is they\u2019re going to do exactly the opposite. They\u2019re going to use their \u201cBack to the Future\u201d strategy of investing in fossil fuels over people and polluters over people.\n\nWhat lessons are we learning from how we responded to the coronavirus crisis that could be applied to how we take action on climate change?\n\n\u201cNobody wants to hear from politicians about their view of science.\u201d\n\nOne of the things that it is teaching is the value of science. We have been struggling through this administration with attacks on science, and I don\u2019t think they can continue. So there\u2019s going to be a real demand for people to pay attention to facts, and for science, and to listen to experts.\n\nNobody wants to hear from politicians about their view of science as opposed to looking at experts. So maybe there\u2019ll be a resurgence like there was 50 years ago with Earth Day, with people standing up and saying, \u201cOkay, enough with this nonsense. Let\u2019s look at real facts, look at science, let\u2019s listen to experts, and let\u2019s find a way forward.\u201d I\u2019m pretty confident that that shift will be enormously important. And people will start getting engaged again because they realize if they don\u2019t, then they\u2019re going to lose \u2014 then they\u2019re going to have a democracy that doesn\u2019t work. And if they get engaged, they\u2019ll be able to make demands for a future they care about, one that protects their families and provides their kids with the kind of stability and opportunity that they deserve.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":464,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/28\/21240137\/is-it-safe-to-order-take-out-during-the-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-28","author":[],"title":"Is it safe to order take-out during the pandemic?","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/bXXK9m2knttsc_aY7YF-2sIkglY=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19930913\/1210662679.jpg.jpg","body_text":"Is it safe to order food via take-out or delivery?\n\nUnlike some germs, there\u2019s no indication the coronavirus can spread through food, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a respiratory virus, not a foodborne virus ... you can\u2019t catch it from eating food,\u201d says Michelle Danyluk at the University of Florida, which published tips on food safety amid the pandemic.\n\nGet the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.\n\nThe biggest concern remains person-to-person contact.

A senior White House official said the administration was working to prevent a situation in which a majority of processing plants shut down for a period of time, which could lead to an 80% drop in the availability of meat in supermarkets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before its release.\n\nTrump on Tuesday told reporters that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of supply,\u201d but that supply chains had hit what he called a \u201croad block.

While the output at beef and poultry plants has diminished, pork plants in the Midwest have been hit especially hard.

Others, such as the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University, recruit three or four every year.\n\nMy research team came to this $500,000 figure by linking 10 years\u2019 worth of football recruiting information from Rivals.com and Scout.com, two of the top recruiting services for prospective college football players, with federal data on how much colleges take in and spend on athletics, win-loss records for individual schools and post-season bowl appearances.\n\nThe data shows revenue and expenditures for each sport separately, which made it possible to determine what a football recruit added to football revenue at each university.\n\nSchools like the University of Oklahoma, the University of Michigan and Notre Dame, which on average bring in over a dozen four- or five-star recruits every year, bring in millions of dollars more in revenue when they land more of the top recruits in a given year.\n\nFor instance, my estimates suggests that Clemson University\u2019s five-star recruits, of which there were five, and 12 four-star recruits \u2014 also in top one-quarter of 1% of all players \u2014 in the 2020 recruiting class will increase the school\u2019s football revenue by well over $3 million, well above its $1.8 million recruiting budget.\n\nThe reason is simple: Top recruits help teams win.\n\nSince a top recruit correlates strongly with increases in the number of victories, they help determine the type of post-season play. Five-star recruits are not the deciding factor in whether a school gets to a bowl game, the mark of a winning season \u2014 the big-time programs will have winning records every year without fail.\n\nBut they do push them to the upper echelon of post-season play \u2014 the College Football Playoffs or its forerunner, the Bowl Championship Series. Reaching the championship level in college football contributes to lucrative broadcast contracts, corporate partnerships and even more successful recruiting.\n\nVery few schools are consistently successful in the race to recruit top football talent and win at the highest levels. Just as nine schools have been responsible for 20% of all players drafted into the NFL over the past two decades, only six schools have made it to the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\nFinancing other sports\n\nThere is more than hoisting football trophies at stake.\n\nCollege football is a key driver of athletic department revenue as well, helping to pay for other sports programs. Athletic departments that field more than 30 varsity teams do so understanding that fewer than five varsity teams generate enough revenue to cover the entire athletics department\u2019s expenses.\n\nIn fact, some critics argue that big-time college sports, which feature rosters made up primarily of black student-athletes, pay for the sports programs that include overwhelmingly white student-athletes, such as lacrosse and swimming, which receive far less media attention but are the bulk of athletes in major collegiate sports programs. Sixty-one percent of all student athletes are white.\n\nFootball revenue also helps finance athletic recruiting efforts and amenities, such as state-of-the-art facilities. All of that takes money, which takes recruits, which takes money. Every recruiting video, campus visit and hosted meal is a line item on an athletic department\u2019s budget.\n\nCOVID-19 repercussions\n\nThe possibility of there being no college football season in the fall of 2020 is making athletics departments fear big budget cuts.\n\nAlready, some schools are dropping sports that were subsidized by college football revenues, like men\u2019s soccer and wrestling. Smaller schools that depend on a few $1 million paydays in September from the major programs, may be left with gaping holes in their athletic budgets, threatening all sports.\n\nThere is little doubt that changes are coming to the current model of athletic department operations through a variety of converging forces. COVID-19 is unleashing widespread job losses, business closures and declining consumer spending that will limit what fans and advertisers can spend on football.\n\nAnother factor could be a change by the National Collegiate Athletic Association \u2014 which governs college athletics \u2014 that could allow student-athletes to get paid from their name, image and likeness.\n\nWhile schools rich with talent may continue to get richer, those schools further down the recruiting pecking order will be left to wonder how they can survive at all.\n\nTrevon Logan is a professor of economics at The Ohio State University.\n\nThis article originally was published on The Conversation.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":486,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/29\/21239689\/coronavirus-pandemic-end-covid19-reopen-vaccine-treatment-testing","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-29","author":"['Mary Beth Griggs']","title":"No one knows when the COVID-19 pandemic will end","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/1b70k6QrPQMTkdr4VOCaZCogA1Y=\/0x186:3000x1757\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19932095\/VRG_Covid_Calendar_3995.0.jpg","body_text":"If you\u2019ve been marking the pandemic by the pileup of cautious reopenings and rescheduled events, you might think that an end to this global disaster is in sight. Event planners for the Kentucky Derby and Bonnaroo already have new opening days on the books in September. The Olympics are scheduled to start in Tokyo on July 23rd, 2021. There\u2019s just one problem: if anyone says that they know exactly when this pandemic will be over, they are lying.\n\nNo one can see the future. The virus is an unknown player, and the best minds on Earth can\u2019t do more than make educated guesses about what comes next and when. Hell, we didn\u2019t even notice the blood clot situation until just recently.\n\nI know. A guess is not comforting when you\u2019re dreading another week of monotony in the same four walls. End dates are comforting. Reopenings are comforting. Contemplating a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present. But let\u2019s not confuse comfort for truth.\n\na future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present\n\nWhen bowling alleys and tattoo parlors reopened in Georgia on Friday, the pandemic was not over. It won\u2019t be over when the stay-at-home order in Michigan (maybe) lifts on May 15th or if the stay-at-home order in the Bay Area actually ends on May 31st.\n\nThe dates politicians are throwing around are not finish lines. They aren\u2019t guesses at an end date for this pandemic, either. Shelter-in-place orders are just time-outs. We have no sure-fire treatments for the virus, no vaccine, and a limited supply of health care workers. To keep as many people alive as possible, we\u2019ve done the only thing we can do to slow the spread: we\u2019ve hid from each other.\n\nThe virus\u2019s effects have not been, as some proposed, a great equalizer. The less you have, the harder you\u2019re hit. The federal government has mostly failed at leading a coherent response to the pandemic. Doctors are clashing with the FBI over PPE, then running into the ER with whatever they can scrounge up. Governors are hitting up their private-jet-owner friends to have masks flown in from China to equip their hospitals. Nurses at other facilities are resorting to wearing garbage bags in an unsuccessful bid to avoid contracting the virus on the job.\n\nPeople who are already vulnerable are getting hit the hardest. Death rates have soared in black communities already slammed by other public health crises. On the Navajo Nation, experts worry that water shortages are contributing to the virus\u2019s continued spread. The virus has raged through cramped homeless shelters and through the communities that can\u2019t afford to distance themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s become very clear to me what a socioeconomic disease this is,\u201d an ER doctor working in Elmhurst, Queens told The New Yorker. \u201cPeople hear that term \u2018essential workers.\u2019 Short-order cooks, doormen, cleaners, deli workers\u2014that is the patient population here.\u201d In some US prisons, the vast majority of inmates are testing positive for the virus, leaving incarcerated persons in fear for their lives. One inmate, Sterling Rivers, grimly observed that \u201cOur sentences have turned into death sentences\u201d in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Our failures around the coronavirus are systemic failures of public policy.\n\nThanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries\n\nThose failures have left the health care system struggling to cope, plunged society into a well of uncertainty, and sent the economy cratering. Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries. Twenty-six million people have filed unemployment claims.\n\nAnd so some governors will call an end to stay-home orders in the hopes of resuscitating their economies. In Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Tennessee, that time came on Friday. Other states, like California and New York, are taking a longer view, gradually easing some restrictions on movement while enforcing new requirements \u2014 masks on, low temps, can\u2019t lose.\n\nAs cases decrease, restrictions will relax. But once we let our guard down, we\u2019ll likely see resurgences of cases, once again straining health resources \u2014 leaving us with no choice but to close ourselves off again. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in parts of China now, where new outbreaks of the same disease have emerged. The open-and-shut economy will likely continue as cases ebb and flow.\n\nThere are paths to victory, but as Ezra Klein notes at Vox, \u201cthese aren\u2019t plans for returning to anything even approaching normal.\u201d Victory over the virus will involve a lot of things that we don\u2019t have yet. Scientific discoveries will help defeat the virus \u2014 but science can\u2019t do it alone. Public policies will play a huge role, and even with firm health guidelines and speedy scientific developments, it will take longer than we want for us to truly eke out a win.\n\nWhat does a win look like? It will take widespread tests of everyone who might be sick and careful quarantining of anyone who tests positive. It will take armies of contact tracers to trace down anyone who might have been exposed. These low-tech interventions are the best thing we\u2019ve got while we give researchers the time they need to come up with other solutions.\n\nOur brightest prospects \u2014 vaccines and treatments \u2014 are still in the minors\n\nScientists will labor over vaccines and treatments, but the overwhelming majority of their trials will turn up nothing useful. They\u2019ll also keep trying to understand the virus and our bodies\u2019 complicated response to it, in the hopes of developing legitimate antibody tests. Eventually, we may discover something that destroys the virus without wrecking our bodies. But none of that is ready today.\n\nThe end is still likely to be a long way away, as journalist Ed Yong writes in The Atlantic: \u201cThe pandemic is not a hurricane or a wildfire. It is not comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9\/11. Such disasters are confined in time and space. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will linger through the year and across the world.\u201d\n\nConsider this a rebuilding year. It might even turn into rebuilding years, depending on our progress. Our brightest prospects \u2014 vaccines and treatments \u2014 are still in the minors. Even antibody testing isn\u2019t ready to be called up to the big leagues, at least not yet.\n\nThis is a long game, and focusing on the victory celebrations \u2014 like New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio\u2019s plan to \u201cthrow the biggest, best parade to honor\u201d health care workers \u2014 won\u2019t get us to the end.\n\nIf we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we\u2019re going to keep being disappointed\n\nIf we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we\u2019re going to keep being disappointed. We\u2019ll feel defeated every time a drug fails in testing. We can\u2019t let it get to us like that. The parades, the ballgames, the worship services that we\u2019re looking forward to, those will be there once this is over. What we\u2019ve got to ensure now is that when we get to reopening day \u2014 whenever it is \u2014 that our concert halls and stadiums and spiritual homes are filled with as many of our human siblings as we can possibly save.\n\nIt still sucks when the goalposts move from April 15th to April 30th, then to May 15th. It feels like we\u2019re Charlie Brown and the end to this is a football that Lucy keeps pulling away. But when it comes to the virus itself, the clock isn\u2019t the statistic that matters. These are the ones that do: numbers of tests, numbers of new infections, and numbers of bodies in the morgues.\n\nWhen the numbers of tests go up and confirmed cases and deaths go down, then our playbook will change. But it won\u2019t be the end of the fight \u2014 not yet.\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to mark this finale in our calendars\n\nWe play this through to the end \u2014 there is no other option. Victory might look like a vaccine. It might look like a robust testing regime or a new treatment. It might look like us cobbling together a sense of normalcy and still watching for repeated outbreaks. Whatever form it takes, we\u2019ll fight our way there with masks, thermometers, and soap, buying some time along the way. We\u2019ll adjust our playbook as the virus adapts. We\u2019ll position ourselves farther apart. We\u2019ll do it again, and again when the next waves of this virus come. We will be exhausted when we get there, but we will get there. But if we don\u2019t pace ourselves for the long haul, it will be that much harder to get through.\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to mark this finale in our calendars. All we can do is get through today, pushing our leaders to get the people on the front lines the resources and time they need to get us through this. We need politicians who will stop telling us the comforting things we want to hear and start acting to keep as many of us alive as possible.\n\nCorrection 4\/29: On Friday, 4\/24.

Subscribe here .\n\nOh hey, today is our 500th issue! Thanks to everyone who has been with us from the beginning, and each of you who has joined along the way. We can\u2019t imagine a better use of our time during this weird era than bringing you news and analysis of the day\u2019s big moments in tech, democracy, and the pandemic.\n\nOne result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that big tech companies, which long have been reluctant to intervene in questions of content moderation, have quickly become much more aggressive. At Google, for example, the company began showing news stories from trusted sources to anyone who searched for information about the virus. It stepped up efforts to remove videos containing misinformation about the pandemic from YouTube.\n\nYouTube also added a \u201cshelf\u201d of high-quality breaking news videos, along with links to the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health authorities. As a result, YouTube says, news consumption is up 75 percent from this time last year, and links to the WHO and CDC have received more than 20 billion impressions.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, YouTube took a step that, among the big social platforms, has so far only been implemented by Facebook: adding fact-check articles to search results. I wrote about it at The Verge:\n\nYouTube will begin adding informational panels containing information from its network of fact-checkers to videos in the United States, the company said. The panels, which were introduced last year in Brazil and India, appear on searches for topics where fact-checkers have published relevant articles on the subject. The move comes at a time when platforms have seen a surge in misinformation related to COVID-19 and its origin, possible cures, and other subjects. [...] YouTube says \u201cmore than a dozen\u201d US publishers are already participating in its network of fact-checkers, including FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and The Washington Post Fact Checker. The network is open to any publisher that is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and signs its code of principles. Google recently announced that it would donate $1 million to the IFCN.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, I spoke with YouTube\u2019s head of product, Neal Mohan, about how the company is navigating several challenges related to the pandemic. We talked about evolving advice from public health organizations, scrubbing bad content from the platform, and the company\u2019s increasing reliance on automated systems for moderation.\n\n\u201cWhen users are searching on YouTube around a specific claim, we want to give an opportunity for those fact checks to show up right then and there, when our users are looking for information \u2014 especially around fast-moving, quickly changing topics like COVID-19,\u201d Mohan told me.\n\nHighlights from our interview are below, edited lightly for clarity and length.\n\nCasey Newton: You rolled out fact checks in Brazil and India last year. What did you learn?\n\nNeal Mohan: We happened to roll it out in India right around the time of their elections last year. Those are the largest elections in the world, and as a result of the number of people that vote, the election itself occurs over the course of a month. So there was time for the potential spread of a lot of misinformation between one election date and another.\n\nWe have information panels that we triggered in the case of more evergreen conspiracies, like flat earth and anti-vaccine. But what about fast-moving, changing news events where there might not be a robust Wikipedia article or a CDC entry or an Encyclopedia Britannica article to link to? And so that\u2019s why we leaned on this concept of actually bringing professional fact checkers into our YouTube search results and triggering them there.\n\nAnd our experience both in India and Brazil was positive. We think that we did our job in terms of curtailing the spread of misinformation in an otherwise sort of pretty flammable environment. Most importantly from my standpoint, we felt that we did right by our users in terms of doing our best to try to prevent this happening in those countries. And that that sort of positive result for our users led us to expand it here in the US. And our goal is not to just stop at these three countries \u2014 we want to continue to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.\n\nOne challenge of policing information about COVID-19 is that the disease itself is new, and the advice we get keeps evolving. In some cases, advice like \u201cdon\u2019t wear masks\u201d has changed to \u201ceveryone please wear masks.\u201d How should a big tech platform approach that problem?\n\nMy perspective there is that we really do have to rely on sources \u2014 and in our case, that means channels \u2014 that have a track record of being relevant and credible in this space. Yes, lots of guidelines are changing, every single day, every single week. You\u2019re literally seeing science being created on an hourly or daily basis. And so the reason why surfacing authoritative results feels like the best thing that we can do is because even if there\u2019s a change, an authoritative source is going to give the context behind it.\n\nSo let\u2019s say there\u2019s a change in mask guidance. I would expect an authoritative news outlet, or a medical authority like the CDC, to give context on it and say, \u2018this used to be our guidance, and our new guidance is this, and here\u2019s the reason why.\u2019 Or a news publication covering it says \u2018CDC changes its guidelines: this is what they used to say, now they\u2019re saying this, and this is the science that led them to change that.\u2019 And by surfacing authoritative results, I think we\u2019re doing what we can as a platform to deliver the most timely, but also the most credible information to our users.\n\nI know YouTube has also been relying on more automated systems during the past couple months due to challenges with being able to bring third-party vendors into offices. How are you measuring the effect on your moderation decisions?\n\nA lot of of this was really very, very simple, which was protecting the health of our extended workforce. And for me and I think for everybody else here at YouTube and Google, that was really the number one consideration, and frankly everything else we were going to do was going to be secondary.\n\nYou and I have talked before about the way that [content moderation] works best is through a combination of machines and machine learning, and the nuanced judgment of well trained raters who do this for a living. Without that second part, we\u2019ve had to rely much more on handling things through appeals. Because there\u2019s a lot of action taken by these machines, sometimes those appeals are impacted in terms of our response time. But generally speaking, we\u2019ve been able to manage this.\n\nFinally, we\u2019re in a situation in which some of the people spreading misinformation about COVID-19 are elected officials. How is YouTube approaching that when it comes to moderation?\n\nJust to be very clear, our community guidelines are based on the content. That applies to the content within the videos, and it also applies to comments and any other surface, if you will, on the YouTube platform. And so they\u2019re not about the speaker. The policies apply equally, whether you or I say something, an elected official does, or a national leader does. This crisis is no different.\n\nOne of the enforcement examples that we gave around medical misinformation was explicitly encouraging somebody to flout state or national guidance around a stay-at-home order. And this happened in the case of the Brazilian president.\n\nWe removed a couple of videos that happened when there was an explicit call to flout those orders. Of course, you have to strike the right balance. If there are people who have different opinions or would like to express an opinion \u2014 in terms of economic trade-offs versus health trade-offs \u2014 then that discourse needs to be allowed and protected on our platform. But something that explicitly says, through false information, that stay-at-home doesn\u2019t actually do anything, that would be an example of a policy violation, regardless of who the speaker is.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending down: Amazon may have violated federal safety standards for providing \u201cinadequate\u201d protections to warehouse workers in New York, according to the state attorney general.

The project was driven by a handful of dedicated employees. Here\u2019s Christina Farr at CNBC:\n\nThat speed of development was highly unusual for Apple, a company obsessed with making its products perfect before releasing them to the world. Project Bubble also required that Apple join forces with its historic rival, Google, to co-develop technology that could be used by health authorities in countries around the world. The software, which Apple and Google now refer to by the softer-sounding term \u201cexposure notification\u201d instead of \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d is due to be released on May 1.

He didn\u2019t know his dad was fading away on a ventilator, diagnosed with coronavirus at the federal prison where he was serving time for a drug charge.\n\nHis father, also named Michael, was held at FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles and died April 19. At least half the population there has tested positive, the largest known hot spot in the federal prison system. But the first word the family received of the father\u2019s illness was the day he died, from a prison chaplain asking if the body should be cremated and where the ashes should be sent.\n\n\u201cThey just left us all in the dark,\u201d Fleming said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe had to find out from the news what the actual cause of death was. It was kind of screwed up.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How prison has shaped one artist\u2019s view on social distancing\n\nThe response from the federal Bureau of Prisons to the growing coronavirus crisis in prisons has raised alarm among advocates and lawmakers about whether the agency is doing enough to ensure the safety of the nearly 150,000 inmates serving time in federal facilities.\n\nAnd even though officials have stressed infection and death rates inside prisons are lower compared with outside, new figures provided by the Bureau of Prisons show that out of 2,700 tests systemwide, nearly 2,000 have come back positive, strongly suggesting there are far more COVID-19 cases left uncovered.\n\nAt the same time, the Bureau of Prisons communication policies are leaving families in the dark about their loved ones\u2019 potentially life-threatening condition.\n\nThe 59-year-old Fleming had been serving a 20-year sentence on a drug conspiracy charge. The Bureau of Prisons never notified Fleming\u2019s family that he was taken to a hospital or when his condition declined.\n\n\u201cNot having the opportunity to say goodbye \u2014 that would\u2019ve been invaluable,\u201d the younger Fleming said. \u201cWe will never have that chance.\u201d\n\nUnder Bureau of Prisons policy, the agency is supposed to \u201cpromptly\u201d notify the family of inmates who have serious illnesses. But the agency, which confirmed the family wasn\u2019t initially notified, has \u201cdiscretion when making notifications,\u201d according to a spokeswoman.\n\nPrisons officials say they are doing the best they can under dire circumstances and following guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cWe are doing the right things to manage our population and to keep them as safe as possible at this time when we can\u2019t provide that assurance to our average American free public that everyone is safe and secure right now with this pandemic,\u201d said Kathy Hawk Sawyer, a senior adviser at the Bureau of Prisons who previously ran the agency twice.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 30 inmates, including Fleming, had died of the coronavirus at federal correctional facilities since late March. About 600 have recovered.\n\nPrisons officials have daily calls with CDC officials, and CDC teams have visited several correctional facilities. As part of the plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus, officials have limited inmate movement, set up tents to increase bed space, isolated inmates at some prisons and identified others for possible home confinement.\n\nThe Justice Department obtained 20 ventilators for use at hospitals housing federal prisoners, Dr. Jeffrey Allen, the bureau\u2019s medical director, said in an interview.\n\nIn the last week, the Bureau of Prisons has obtained more than 5,000 test kits and now has 20 rapid testing machines deployed at hot spot prisons to increase testing numbers, Allen said.\n\nHe insisted that testing was in line with current CDC guidance and that officials are working daily to discover new strategies to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cA lot is yet unknown about how to limit its transmission in a correctional environment, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re collaborating with the CDC to try to identify that sort of data that can inform our management strategies going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Riots, escapes and fear as coronavirus hits juvenile centers\n\nBut at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal lockup in New York City housing 1,700 inmates, there were only nine nasal swab test kits late last month, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of inmates there. Just one inmate has been confirmed with coronavirus there, according to Bureau of Prisons statistics.\n\nDeirdre D. von Dornum, attorney-in-charge of the Federal Defenders of New York in Brooklyn, said there was a reason.\n\n\u201cThey are not testing anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the New York City jail where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, inmate Guillermo Zegarra-Martinez told his attorney in an email that his cellmate tested positive for the coronavirus and was put in isolation for more than two weeks.\n\nBut Zegarra-Martinez was not tested even though he was shaking in his cell with a fever during nights while experiencing pain throughout his body in the week before his cellmate was taken out and the week after, the inmate wrote.\n\nThe sick inmate was taken out of the cell only \u201cbecause he was coughing on the face of the guy\u201d who took his temperature, Zegarra-Martinez said, according to his lawyer, Sabrina Shroff.\n\nAdvocates and even prison guards have been calling for reforms to head off outbreaks in a prison system plagued for years by violence, misconduct and staffing shortages. Nearly 350 staff members have tested positive.\n\nStaff are sent around the country to pick up shifts, and union officials say the shortages are still so severe that officers are sometimes working 24 hours in a row. At a prison in Elkton, Ohio, where seven inmates have died, the governor called in the National Guard to help supplement medical staff.\n\nOfficers worry that the protective equipment they\u2019ve been given isn\u2019t adequate to protect them from daily contact with inmates, especially at facilities where dozens have tested positive.\n\nBut Hawk Sawyer said the Bureau of Prisons is prepared with ample amount of personal protective equipment and supplies, including soap and disinfectant.\n\n\u201cWe are creating and making the masks for the staff, as well as the shields and hand sanitizer and all kinds of things,\u201d she said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael R.

But for the last month, Van Buren and a group of his colleagues at JPL have been working on a project that is truly unexplored terrain for them: making a ventilator to help patients sick with COVID-19.\n\nWhile Van Buren had some previous experience in medical engineering, he\u2019d never designed a ventilator before. But he and his co-workers at JPL are used to making things they don\u2019t have any experience making. In fact, they\u2019re used to making things that no one has experience making.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to looking at new problems ... and figuring out how to do them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a scientist comes to us and says they want to go to a moon of Jupiter and drill into the ice and see what\u2019s underneath, that\u2019s something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Van Buren tells The Verge. \u201cWe\u2019re used to looking at new problems \u2014 things people haven\u2019t done before or at least that we haven\u2019t done before \u2014 and figuring out how to do them.\u201d\n\nAfter a whirlwind 37 days of research, planning, and tinkering, a subset of engineers at JPL have created a prototype they\u2019re calling the VITAL ventilator. A white digital box with a breathing tube attached, the ventilator is somewhere between the sophisticated high-end ventilators that the sickest patients need and a simple ambulatory bag that can be used as a temporary measure to quickly squeeze air into the lungs. The team didn\u2019t want to interfere with the production of the more critical ventilators, so the VITAL ventilator is meant for the patients who still need breathing support but are not in the most dire conditions. It\u2019s a temporary tool designed to last just three to four months in a hospital.\n\nVITAL is tailored specifically for people with COVID-19, which helped to guide its design. \u201cIt\u2019s pared down in all the things that it can do, to just retain those functions needed for COVID-19 patients,\u201d says Van Buren.\n\nThroughout January and February, Van Buren had been following the news about the spread of COVID-19 in China with growing concern. Pandemics have been on his mind ever since the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009 when his daughter had to be hospitalized because of the new flu strain.\n\nWhen it became clear in early March that there was community spread of COVID-19 in Washington and California, Van Buren really started focusing on what he could do to help. Early models suggested that hospitals would not have enough capacity or equipment to handle the influx of COVID-19 patients. Van Buren figured JPL could be an asset in the fight. One day, he bumped into Rob Manning, JPL\u2019s chief engineer, in the center\u2019s cafeteria, and they started talking about what they could do. \u201cWe both had been thinking, given the circumstances, maybe the projects that we were spending our time on might not be the most important things we could be doing, given what we both recognized was about to happen,\u201d Van Buren says.\n\n\u201cWe more or less applied the pattern we apply when we build an instrument to land on Mars.\u201d\n\nManning found money to form a small team, and the project kicked off on March 16th. The group contacted a pulmonologist named Michael Gurevitch who\u2019s been working on ventilators for decades. He came in and told the team the exact requirements that were needed for ventilators, while a JPL employee took detailed notes on a giant whiteboard.\n\n\u201cWe more or less applied the pattern we apply when we build an instrument to land on Mars and, say, drill through the surface and take measurements of what\u2019s down below,\u201d says Van Buren. \u201cWe engage with scientists. In this case, we engaged with the clinicians as to what exactly is needed, so that we can then engineer an instrument \u2014 or in this case, a ventilator.\u201d\n\nEventually, other people at JPL joined the project, including Michelle Easter. Normally, she works on mechanisms known as actuators. These motors are used to deploy or rotate instruments like solar panels during a mission.\n\n\u201cActuators are often a combination of mechanisms and electronics,\u201d Easter tells The Verge. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what the VITAL device is; it\u2019s a mechanism that\u2019s controlled by embedded electronics, and that type of design is something super comfortable for me.\u201d\n\nTo make VITAL, the team tried to use as many common, off-the-shelf parts as possible, such as tubing, motors, valves, and electronics displays. That way, anyone manufacturing the device in the future wouldn\u2019t need to special order anything needed for a more sophisticated ventilator. The team found that companies and vendors were eager to help provide supplies that could be scalable. And when they didn\u2019t have what JPL needed, they gave them references.\n\n\u201cCompanies were just opening up their Rolodexes and giving us the names of their competitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompanies were just opening up their Rolodexes and giving us the names of their competitors,\u201d says Easter, \u201cwhich is not what you think for a business mindset. But people threw all of the traditional competition out the window.\u201d\n\nEventually, the team settled on the final VITAL design. Because the machine is tailored for COVID-19 patients, it\u2019s focused on providing air delicately to stiff lungs \u2014 a hallmark symptom of the virus. Stiff lungs have a harder time expanding, so patients struggle to get enough air to breathe. VITAL is meant to provide enough air pressure to patients to inflate their lungs but not so much so that the lungs over-expand. The machine also works to ensure the lungs don\u2019t completely deflate, either. COVID-19 patients have lung damage that makes the sides of their lungs inflamed and sticky. If all the air goes out of their lungs and the sides touch each other, they might stick together and make it even harder to open back up again. So VITAL tries to keep the lungs slightly inflated whenever patients exhale.\n\nNow that the team has a working prototype, they\u2019ve moved on to environmental testing with the device. Whenever NASA sends a spacecraft to another world, each vehicle must be subjected to extreme conditions \u2014 such as wide-ranging temperatures, intense vibrations, loud sounds, and more \u2014 to see if it can withstand the harsh environment of space. Many of those same tests are needed to qualify medical equipment, too, and JPL has the facilities to run them, including a giant vacuum chamber and setups to shake hardware rigorously.\n\n\u201cWe build spacecraft not medical devices, but there are so many similar elements, because they both have to be extremely high reliability systems \u2014 for different reasons,\u201d says Easter. \u201cFor spacecraft, once you put it up in space, you will never be able to go and fix it. So we have to verify that it\u2019s absolutely perfect and works exactly as we expect in all conditions. Then, of course, for the medical devices, we\u2019re connecting this to a human; we have to verify that we\u2019re not going to hurt a person. They\u2019re both very, very important.\u201d\n\nSince the Food and Drug Administration is encouraging organizations to create new devices quickly to combat COVID-19, many of the tests usually required to certify equipment are no longer needed. But JPL still has to do elevation testing with VITAL to see if the machine will work in places like Denver, for instance. They also need to do electromagnetic interference testing, which will determine if VITAL can operate normally if someone is, say, talking on a cellphone nearby.\n\n\u201cWe build spacecraft not medical devices, but there are so many similar elements.\u201d\n\nOn April 30th, JPL received word from the FDA that VITAL will receive an emergency use authorization. Now that they have approval, the team will send the design off to companies that can produce VITAL en masse and deliver the ventilators to hospitals in need. \u201cWe don\u2019t do production,\u201d says Van Buren. \u201cWe do make one or two of a kind, and we send them off to Mars or Saturn or somewhere. And so we have engaged a couple of companies to help us understand the mass production aspects.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the team will proceed when the VITAL ventilator is shipped out into the world. Many of the people on the team put their normal projects on pause to get this ventilator ready as soon as possible. They\u2019ll likely go back to designing interplanetary space probes very soon, but they\u2019ve been buoyed by their brief stint in the medical world.\n\n\u201cI think everybody on the team is just so grateful that we have something positive to contribute in our brainpower and our teamwork,\u201d says Easter. \u201cIt definitely helps us to feel empowered in an otherwise powerless kind of situation.\u201d\n\nUpdate April 30th, 6:30PM ET: This article was updated to indicate that the VITAL ventilator had received emergency use authorization from the FDA.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":496,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/29\/21241818\/weiss-memorial-hospital-treats-coronavirus-patient-blood-plasma","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-29","author":"['Stefano Esposito']","title":"Uptown hospital successfully treats coronavirus patient with blood plasma from someone who recovered from the sickness","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/0Cgc_k6d_IsDKg_QXP3SFJE0MiY=\/0x192:4240x2412\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19933777\/CV_HOSPITALS_032120_12.jpg","body_text":"An Uptown hospital is among the first Chicago-area facilities to successfully treat a coronavirus patient using an investigational therapy involving plasma taken from someone who has recovered from the virus.\n\nThe patient was a Chicago man in his 40s who arrived at Weiss Memorial Hospital in \u201cmoderate to severe\u201d condition and had not responded to other treatments, said Dr. Suzanne Pham, the hospital\u2019s associate medical director.

Pritzker\u2019s March 21 stay-at-home order put the brakes on much activity across Illinois \u2013 from bars and barber shops to baseball diamonds and beaches.\n\nAnd as important as it all is to the politicians, hand-shaking, door-knocking and glad-handing for contributions are not deemed essential business.\n\nTypically, campaigns begin shifting gears after the primary to prepare for the general election \u2014 candidates work rooms, attend fundraisers and meet with both would-be donors and potential supporters. Underdogs schedule regular news conferences in hopes of raising their profiles.\n\nBut as the state grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, many countywide candidates who are looking to the November general election are doing little campaigning and have reported little, if any, money coming in, according to Illinois Board of Elections filings.\n\nFor the county\u2019s marquee race \u2014 Cook County state\u2019s attorney \u2014 the pandemic has meant a shifting of resources and focus.\n\nHoping to topple incumbent Democrat Kim Foxx, Republican nominee Pat O\u2019Brien said the coronavirus pandemic has made for a \u201cless than typical fundraising\u201d cycle now focused on Zoom or phone calls as a means for getting funding and support from would-be voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy when coronavirus has created economic uncertainty, but it\u2019s not impossible,\u201d the former Circuit Court judge said. \u201cObviously money is important to get the message out, but I think we\u2019ll have the money to do that. All the money in the world can\u2019t change what she\u2019s already done and the opinion people have of her.\u201d\n\nAlex Sims, a senior adviser for Foxx\u2019s re-election effort, said in a statement the campaign \u201cacknowledges this challenging time and that individuals and families are facing new financial circumstances due to COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch of the Foxx campaign\u2019s current efforts are going towards a \u2018Good Neighbor\u2019 program, offering wellness checks to our constituents, in partnership with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky,\u201d Sims said. \u201cWith a pivotal race ahead of her, the State\u2019s Attorney is being cautious and thoughtful in her fundraising efforts as she pushes forward to November.\u201d\n\nFoxx\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t reported any new campaign donations since the March primary. Four years ago, in the days immediately after the March 15 primary, Foxx reported nearly $75,000 in cash and in-kind contributions.\n\nThe bulk of that was a $40,000 gift from Foxx\u2019s mentor and chair of the Cook County Democrats Toni Preckwinkle, who doubles as Cook County Board president.\n\nThe county party is also seeing its fundraising impacted by the pandemic.\n\nExecutive director Jacob Kaplan said the party is still \u201ctrying to figure out how to adapt to the new world we\u2019re likely to be in for a while.\u201d\n\nTypically, Cook County Democrats hold a 500-person fundraiser in October, but no one knows if that will be held or how.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of answers at this point,\u201d Kaplan said, adding that the party is exploring some options, including hosting the event virtually. \u201cHow do you book an event if you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s possible?\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges, Kaplan says the party will \u201craise money one way or another.\u201d\n\nCampaigning will likely look different come fall \u2014 think more phone banking, mailings and virtual campaigning rather than door-to-door interactions or events.\n\nCook County Republican Chairman Sean Morrison pointed to Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden\u2019s virtual rallies as a \u201csymbol of the current political landscape across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight about now I would be having a spring fundraiser,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough. Nobody has the ability to go out and do anything. Our guidance to candidates has been pick up a phone, pick up the established donor list and make some phone calls.\u201d\n\nBut given the state of the economy, Morrison said he doesn\u2019t know \u201chow loose the purse strings are going to be for down ballot races.\u201d\n\nThough Foxx will be able to raise funds from organized labor and special interests and largely rest on her name recognition, Morrison says O\u2019Brien shouldn\u2019t be discounted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get money,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cEven [coronavirus] aside, O\u2019Brien has the best shot [to flip the State\u2019s Attorney seat] in about a decade.\u201d\n\nAs for Manny\u2019s, owner-operator Dan Raskin said employees of the legendary deli are working \u201cextra hard and differently to try to get business\u201d during the pandemic.\n\nRaskin hopes his family\u2019s deli will be able to reopen ahead of the November primary \u2014 for both regular customers and politicians alike.\n\nFor now, candidates can \u201corder their good luck corned beef sandwich, but they can\u2019t eat it here.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":514,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/30\/21242720\/coronavirus-roseland-hospital-nurses-patients-pandemic-covid-19","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":[],"title":"\u2018Our worst day\u2019: The fight to treat patients and keep a hospital staffed on the Far South Side","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/i4O4DcDoyvCnYP59w7O1iAK1GPM=\/0x230:6261x3508\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19935757\/CV_ROSELAND_04XX20_06.jpg","body_text":"\u2018Our worst day\u2019: The fight to treat patients and keep a hospital staffed on the Far South Side\n\nShare All sharing options for: \u2018Our worst day\u2019: The fight to treat patients and keep a hospital staffed on the Far South Side\n\nCapri Reese can\u2019t go home. Not unless she finds someone to step into her shoes.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden we\u2019re down five staff in one day,\u201d said the 12-year veteran nurse at Roseland Community Hospital, who Tuesday had to track down coworkers on their day off and get them to the hospital, in addition to all her usual duties.\n\n\u201cI see patients, treat patients, respond to codes, rapid response, intubate, order tests, write prescriptions,\u201d Reese said. \u201cAll of those things, and I\u2019m also covering for the CNO \u2014 the chief nursing officer.\u201d\n\nFive holes in a 14-person staff, including someone to do her job after her 12-hour shift. Those are very big charm-studded Crocs to fill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling thing, like a rolling puzzle, every day,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t usually call off are calling off.\u201d\n\nWhy? Exhaustion, stress, ailments like the ordinary flu, plus absences related to COVID-19 \u2014 battling it themselves, caring for a relation who is, or watching their children because daycare centers are closed.\n\nAgainst those obstacles, Reese has only her considerable charm.\n\n\u201cStrap that S on your chest and come in,\u201d Reese said over the phone to a triage tech.\n\nHe agreed.\n\n\u201cI won the lottery!\u201d exuded Reese. \u201dHe\u2019s totally coming in on his day off. Everybody is really stepping up.\u201d\n\nShe worked the schedule in Roseland\u2019s \u201cbrain box,\u201d the cluttered office where staffing is managed. But a code blue alarm \u2014 there will be five during her shift \u2014 had her jumping to her feet. She ran \u2014 not walked fast, not trotted, but full-out sprinted \u2014 down the hall, phone still pressed to her ear, talking to one of the staffing agencies the hospital has turned to, trying to keep warm bodies in scrubs to treat the bodies in beds.\n\nThe problem with staffing agencies, she said, is that other war zones, like New York, are paying top dollar, and her nurses are taking it.\n\n\u201cTheir husband may be out of work, and they tell me, \u2018It\u2019s not so much I don\u2019t love Roseland, but they\u2019re offering me more money and we\u2019re down an income,\u2019\u201d Reese said.\n\n\u2018Like playing dodgeball\u2019\n\nOnce in the emergency department, she jams the phone in a pocket; staffing concerns are forgotten in the rainstorm of immediate problems, big and small.\n\nA patient has wandered away from his room and doesn\u2019t know where he belongs.\n\n\u201cCapri, handle this,\u201d said a doctor, shrugging away the situation.\n\nThe ER is low on protective gowns; Reese rushes to the stock room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like playing dodgeball,\u201d she said. Like dodgeball, there is much starting and stopping. It seems she will greet everyone in her line of sight by name and can\u2019t take five steps without someone asking her something.\n\n\u201cPeople are comfortable asking me,\u201d said Reese, who keeps asking passersby, \u201cCan you work until 11? Can you work until 11?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you,\u201d she said, again and again. \u201cI need you.\u201d\n\nOthers, she\u2019ll merely buck up, asking how they are. Not wanting to hug \u2014 a more important part of hospital work than outsiders might realize \u2014 they\u2019ve developed an elaborate code of bows, foot taps, even the occasional curtsy.\n\n\u201cThe nursing staff is under enormous stress,\u201d Reese said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hitting home\u2019\n\nThis all happened so fast. Six weeks. The first person with COVID-19 came into Roseland, on West 111th Street on the Far South Side, on March 15.\n\n\u201cEvery day since then,\u201d Reese said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t some virus overseas. It\u2019s home; it\u2019s hitting home. It became so real. Pandemonium. People coming in, while information and standards change day to day. While we\u2019re trying to get creative, expand to deal with the volume of patients. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d\n\nUnless it\u2019s not. The COVID unit can be silent. Scary quiet. Reese misses the presence of visitors, banished because of the fear of infection. Visitors are a vital line of defense in the health care chain.\n\n\u201cNormally patients have a visitor, sitting with their mom, letting you know their needs. Those are the assessments we are really missing out on. All the history, what\u2019s going on with their mother, their father. Real time information. Everybody being isolated, it\u2019s really hard to manage all of it, being one nurse.\u201d\n\nThe deathly silence in the COVID-19 ward is broken by alarms, screams, cries for help. Reese joined knots of staffers, crammed into Roseland\u2019s tiny rooms, responding to five code blues \u2014 hospital jargon for when a patient\u2019s heart stops beating \u2014 and two rapid responses. Three patients died during her Tuesday shift, all of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt was our worst day,\u201d said Reese.\n\nThe stress of losing patients, of keeping gravely ill patients alive, of being family to the dying, bursts out sometimes. A patient gasped for air, but kept tearing off her BiPAP mask.\n\n\u201cHelp me! Help me!\u201d she cried.\n\n\u201cPatients have so much anxiety, even a little shortness of breath causes them to go into a panic,\u201d said Reese.\n\nOne nurse wanted to restrain the struggling patient so she\u2019d keep wearing the BiPAP, a pressurized breathing device. Another nurse argued that restraining the patient is wrong.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing that!\u201d she said, adding that the patient was not a criminal.\n\nThe argument quickly grew heated, with swearing and shouting.\n\n\u201cTalk to me when you go to college for another four years!\u201d snapped the senior nurse. \u201cUntil then, you don\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d\n\nOne nurse stormed out and took a walk to calm down. The senior nurse stayed; the patient eventually was coaxed back into the mask.\n\nReese herself is not immune to the pressure. Last week, with no visitors allowed, a nurse held a cell phone so a dying woman\u2019s daughter could say goodbye to her mother, apologizing for not being the child she should have been. Then the nurse handed the phone to Reese, to flee the room, weeping. When she returned, Reese handed the phone back to her and left the room; she had to cry, too.\n\n\u201cWe never had the chance to talk about it,\u201d said Reese, of the second nurse. \u201cWe had another rapid response.\u201d\n\nGrid View Registration clerk Frances Horton assists nurse practitioner Capri Reese with her personal protective equipment at Roseland Community Hospital on the Far South Side, Tuesday afternoon, April 28, 2020.

I don\u2019t even have to ask. It\u2019s just there. We have a good family.\u201d\n\nThe difficulties of getting the message to her mother is something Capri Reese sees throughout the community.\n\n\u201cWhen this disease first broke out, everybody thought that for some reason that this was not a disease for African Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cThat it didn\u2019t affect us.

J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday that 177 public sites are now offering free coronavirus testing across the state, with 65 new locations added since Pritzker reported last week that Illinois had reached the elusive goal of processing 10,000 tests in a single day.\n\nSince hitting that mark last Friday, Illinois has run 96,551 total tests and hasn\u2019t once dipped below that daily benchmark. The tests conducted over the past seven days account for more than 35% of the tests the state has conducted since reporting began in early March.\n\nWith his modified stay-at-home taking effect on Friday, Pritzker made it clear that testing for the deadly virus is \u201cvital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and to protect our residents.\u201d\n\nA drive-thru site at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park is among the new testing locations that have recently opened in minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Jose Sanchez, the hospital\u2019s president and CEO, announced Thursday that over 80% of those tested since the site opened Tuesday have been Latino or African American.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the governor\u2019s daily press briefing, Sanchez said the new testing site helps \u201caddress the serious health inequities we have seen in our community.\u201d The Sun-Times reported Thursday that the Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that we identify the individuals that have COVID-19 early so we can provide interventions and prevent the spread of virus in our underserved communities,\u201d added Sanchez, who said the hospital is expected to run \u201chundreds\u201d of COVID-19 tests by the end of the week.\n\nIn addition to the substantial increase in community testing sites like Norwegian, Pritzker announced that new drive-thru sites operated by the state will open next week in Waukegan and East St. Louis. Once those get up-and-running, Pritzker set a goal of collecting a total of 3,000 daily swabs at those seven sites.\n\nAs more tests have been processed, a lower rate have started to come back positive. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike attributed that decrease to the state\u2019s expanded criteria for testing, which had initially been limited to those considered at high risk of contracting the disease.\n\nCasting a wider net is vital for getting a better sense of the true rate of infection. In South Korea, a country of 51 million that acted swiftly to institute an aggressive testing system, the positivity rate has hovered around 3%. Meanwhile, the rate of positive tests in Illinois has fallen to around 20%.\n\n\u201cWe will have that lower positivity rate, but be grateful for the ones that we identify,\u201d Ezike said.\n\nWhile Pritzker said the state has taken considerable steps to address the shortage of supplies needed to run tests \u2014 including striking a deal with the White House to obtain hundreds of thousands of swabs and vials of the solution needed to transport them \u2014 he made it clear that the country \u201cjust doesn\u2019t produce enough of these raw materials to meet the medical need.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur procurement teams have been hard at work competing for those raw materials against every nation and every state in the open market,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cAnd so far, we\u2019re succeeding.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":516,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/30\/21243685\/coronavirus-smartphone-market-impact-q1-2020-covid-19","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":"['Sam Byford']","title":"Coronavirus causes worst smartphone market contraction in history","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/wDe9TmJEqCS8DKih86hprCu0fAk=\/0x172:2040x1240\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19896244\/bfarsace_120612_3970_0005.jpg","body_text":"The coronavirus pandemic has caused the smartphone market to suffer its fastest ever first-quarter year-on-year decline, according to new data from analyst firms. Counterpoint Research and Canalys both put the overall drop in global shipments at 13 percent, though Counterpoint says the drop in China alone was 27 percent while Canalys calculates it at 18 percent.\n\nWhichever numbers you look at, the situation is clear: it\u2019s the first time shipments have come under 300 million since 2014, with a precipitous collapse in China preceding falling demand around the world. \u201cBy the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 started to spread to other regions, and lockdowns of varying severity were imposed, the pendulum of disruption started to swing from supply to demand,\u201d Counterpoint\u2019s team of analysts writes in a statement.\n\nSamsung, Huawei, and Apple are still the top three vendors, with Apple seeing the smallest decline in shipments year on year.

But in March, the situation flipped on its head. Smartphone manufacturing has now recovered, but as half the world entered lockdown, sales plummeted.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the consumer standpoint, unless replacing a broken phone, smartphones are mostly a discretionary purchase,\u201d says Counterpoint associate director Tarun Pathak. \u201cConsumers, under these uncertain times, are likely to withhold making many significant discretionary purchases. This means the replacement cycles are likely to become longer.\u201d\n\nThe true impact of the pandemic is yet to be felt. \u201cMost smartphone companies expect Q2 to represent the peak of the coronavirus\u2019 impact,\u201d says Stanton. \u201cIt will test the mettle of the industry, and some companies, especially offline retailers, will fail without government support.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":517,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/30\/21175145\/the-international-2020-valve-dota-2-coronavirus-delay","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":"['Andrew Webster', 'Nick Statt']","title":"Valve indefinitely delays Dota 2\u2019s The International 2020","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/RtZVorwDd55dbT_x2ZeXYubhelU=\/0x216:3000x1787\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19785356\/1170102374.jpg.jpg","body_text":"One of the biggest esports events in the world has been indefinitely delayed amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Developer Valve announced on Thursday that the 2020 edition of the Dota 2 tournament, known as The International, that was set to take place at the Ericsson Globe arena in Stockholm this August will no longer happen this summer and may be pushed back until 2021. In fact, Valve says it simply doesn\u2019t know when it can announce concrete dates going forward.\n\n\u201cWe have been exploring various date possibilities, but it is likely that the event will need to happen in 2021. Given the highly volatile landscape for local gathering restrictions, virus trajectory, and global travel policies, we don\u2019t expect to have enough confidence to communicate firm dates in the near future,\u201d reads the company\u2019s announcement posted to the Dota 2 blog. \u201cIn the meantime, we are working on restructuring the DPC season for the fall, and will be providing more information as soon as we have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to have enough confidence to communicate firm dates in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe International, which has run annually since 2011, is not only one of the most popular competitive gaming events globally, but also the most lucrative. Last year\u2019s edition, which took place in Shanghai, boasted a prize pool of more than $30 million, topping the record-breaking pool from the first annual Fortnite World Cup.\n\nValve says it still intends to draw its prize pool from sales of its Dota 2 seasonal battle pass, but that it will be releasing the battle pass \u201csoon\u201d instead of closer to the event itself, given the circumstances. \u201cHowever, with our team working from home and things taking longer to complete, the release date of the Battle Pass will be at least a couple of weeks later than usual,\u201d the company says.\n\nValve\u2019s tournament is just the latest in a long line of esports events forced to shift operations. The Overwatch League, with kicked off earlier this year with big ambitions to host home and away games all over the globe, moved to an online-only format alongside the Call of Duty League, while a major League of Legends league shifted games to an online format, too. Everyone from broadcasters to fans have been impacted in some way. Earlier today, Epic Games announced that it would no longer host a 2020 Fortnite World Cup as it shifts all of its competitive circuit for the battle royale shooter to an online-only structure.\n\nHere\u2019s Valve\u2019s announcement in full:","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":518,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/30\/21241402\/infection-count-coronavirus-cases-survellience-flu-hospital-sewage-data","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":"['Nicole Wetsman']","title":"It\u2019s impossible to count everyone with COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/p6QO7JE2cDB1Jb4W64a9d84xKM4=\/0x146:2040x1214\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19933221\/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.jpg","body_text":"Zack Moore, state epidemiologist in North Carolina, can\u2019t say how many people in the state have COVID-19. He knows how many people test positive for the coronavirus each day, and how many people are in the hospitals across the state, and how many people go to the emergency room with an illness that could be COVID-19. None of those numbers alone pins down how many people are infected. But together, they help sketch an outline of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never about one single data source. Every source of data is helpful, but they all have their own limitations. So it\u2019s about using them together,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s no way for public health experts to actually count every single person who has any illness at a given time, even well-known illnesses like the flu. Instead, they combine different sources of data to make the best-possible estimate of what disease outbreaks look like. The goal is to understand the virus well enough to make those estimates as accurate as possible.\n\n\u201cPeople think we know how many people had the flu every year, and we don\u2019t,\u201d Moore says. \u201cWe have to use these surveillance tools and indirect measures to get a full understanding.\u201d\n\nPublic health officials are measuring the COVID-19 pandemic in a handful of ways. The number of positive test results is an important one, says John Brownstein, an infectious disease epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cThat data is incredibly valuable, because it\u2019s confirmed illnesses,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s an imperfect tool because most communities in the United States don\u2019t have enough tests available to test everyone who feels sick.\n\nBecause everyone who\u2019s sick won\u2019t get a test, experts also look to data collected by hospitals on the people who show up to an emergency room with symptoms of COVID-19. Those measurements also have limitations because many people who have these symptoms might just have the flu or another type of respiratory disease. This approach also misses people who may feel sick but don\u2019t feel sick enough to go to the hospital.\n\nZooming out even further, some researchers (including Brownstein) have developed programs that ask people to report how they\u2019re feeling each day. They hope that the data will help reveal hotspots where people are starting to feel sick but aren\u2019t getting tested for COVID-19 yet. Another big-picture strategy is measuring levels of the coronavirus in sewage to predict how many people in a community are infected. Antibody tests, which can check if someone was exposed to the virus in the past, are also critical tools. They can help find people who never felt sick and so wouldn\u2019t be caught by any of the surveillance methods that screen for symptoms.\n\nSevere lack of #COVID19 testing means we need alternate methods to understand community transmission.\n\n\n\nWe are launching @COVIDNearYou crowdsourcing platform. Take a few seconds to report your symptoms and help us build a national picture of #coronavirus.https:\/\/t.co\/2g1hyMQldW pic.twitter.com\/mhIY9VnnGM \u2014 John Brownstein (@johnbrownstein) March 22, 2020\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly trying to bring together different pieces of information, and it all provides a different lens on an outbreak,\u201d Brownstein says.\n\nIn North Carolina, Moore looks at all of their data sources daily and weekly and focuses on the trends in that data. If the number of people coming to the emergency room with symptoms of COVID-19 is going down, but the hospitalization rate and number of positive test results are still going up, it might just mean that people are avoiding the emergency room \u2014 not that fewer people are sick. \u201cIt has to be viewed in the bigger context,\u201d he says. \u201cThe trends are what we\u2019re focused on, because that\u2019s what helps us in terms of making decisions about control measures.\u201d\n\nMoore says they\u2019re looking closely at the surveillance tools they\u2019re not already using to see what might be a useful addition to their data sets. \u201cWe want to understand whether they\u2019re really value added,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create more noise \u2014 surveillance can already be confusing enough.\u201d\n\nOngoing research on the virus and how it spreads also help experts figure out the best way to interpret the data they\u2019re collecting. Studies that collect blood samples to test for antibodies in segments of the population, for example, will help identify the percentage of people who catch the coronavirus without ever feeling sick. With that data, public health officials will be able to more accurately estimate the number of people who actually have the virus using the information they gather on people who report symptoms. Moore says he uses an iceberg metaphor: \u201cWhat we can see is the people who come out and seek medical care. The part under the water is the people who don\u2019t, who we need to learn more about.\u201d\n\nWith well-known diseases, public health experts can look at the number of confirmed cases and predict how many cases went undetected. \u201cWhen we see a single case of hepatitis C, I can tell you pretty confidently that there were 14 other people who probably also had it and weren\u2019t identified,\u201d Moore says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get that level of understanding for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nBrownstein thinks we\u2019re getting closer. \u201cThe further this goes on, the more we\u2019ll be able to get a better estimate.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":520,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/30\/21243053\/coronavirus-african-american-chicago-violent-crime-covid","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":[],"title":"How the coronavirus and Chicago\u2019s gun violence are related","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/SrwcF1miSYSq3KIjDzpYh2nvtyk=\/0x436:5670x3405\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19563630\/merlin_60894711.jpg","body_text":"Why hasn\u2019t violence in Chicago decreased since we have all been ordered to stay at home? Why are the poorest African American neighborhoods that have been plagued by violence now the hardest hit by the coronavirus?\n\nWe think these problems have common roots and common solutions.\n\nGov. J. B. Pritzker issued a statewide shelter-in-place order five weeks ago in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Since that time, Chicago has had over 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 873 virus-related deaths. In that same time period, at least 294 people have been shot and 55 people have been killed in Chicago, placing the city on pace for roughly the same number of shootings and killings as in 2018 and 2019.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe virus and violence have race and poverty in common. African Americans comprise roughly 30% of Chicago\u2019s population but make up nearly half of its poor residents and 80% of its homicide victims.\n\nSimilarly, blacks represent at least 40% of Chicago\u2019s coronavirus cases and 55% of its pandemic-related deaths. Part of this overrepresentation can be explained by black Chicagoans\u2019 disproportionate rates of chronic health conditions, employment in \u201cessential\u201d economic sectors, reliance on public transportation and uninsurance, all of which increase one\u2019s chances of infection and severe symptomatology.\n\nBut another key link between violence and the virus are large numbers of alienated young people on Chicago\u2019s South and West Sides. Like in many other places, young people are ignoring the stay-at-home and social-distancing orders coming from elected officials, heightening the risk of viral infection and transmission. In Chicago, these young people are often the same ones involved in the city\u2019s rampant gun violence that has persisted throughout the pandemic.\n\nOur research with gang members in Chicago over the last 20 years indicates that today\u2019s gang wars are vendettas driven by young people facing desolate circumstances and few, if any, meaningful prospects for a better life.\n\nIn other areas of the world, organized crime groups have stepped in to respond to the pandemic, filling voids left by the retreat of the state. In Mexico and southern Italy, drug cartels and Mafia groups are distributing packages of food to desperate residents. In the favelas of Brazil, drug gangs are imposing a curfew and South African gangs have organized peace treaties and are providing community aid.\n\nChicago, however, has no such organized gangs, particularly in its black neighborhoods, where the monolithic gangs of the 1980s and 1990s have shattered into small, hyperlocal, horizontally organized cliques. There has been no organized response to the pandemic from these groups, since they lack the organization and resources to form any such response. The old gang days are over, and the new cliques are hanging out as usual.\n\nWhat is needed on Chicago\u2019s South and West Sides, however, is not more organized gangs; it is a more legitimate and benevolent state. The desperate conditions in these communities that are driving both the gun violence and coronavirus crises have been caused by decades of private sector abandonment and a public sector that has largely abdicated its role in ensuring people\u2019s welfare in favor of policing and incarcerating.\n\nThe public response should not be to lock these youth up in death traps like Cook County Jail, but to invest in the South and West Sides to give these youth essential resources, hope, and a reason to live. Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s INVEST South\/West proposal would do much to reverse decades of city abandonment in these communities, but without explicit protections for current residents, these efforts are likely to result in rent intensification and displacement for their targeted beneficiaries.\n\nA broad-based public employment initiative is perhaps the most desperately needed intervention in communities where Depression-era levels of unemployment existed even before the pandemic \u2014 and are doubtlessly much worse now. The relative disorganization of today\u2019s gangs and their often-marginal involvement in the illicit drug economy greatly enhances the potential success of such an initiative. Importantly, however, such a program wouldn\u2019t be limited to these communities and would likely enjoy widespread support given the broader economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile the City of Chicago and State of Illinois should marshal whatever resources possible toward this end, they should also demand of their counterparts in Washington \u2014 both current and hopeful \u2014 that a robust federal response is needed. The recent $3 trillion stimulus proves that funding is no valid obstacle \u2014 that where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nLet\u2019s exert the pressure needed to create that will and tackle not only the current coronavirus pandemic, but the ongoing gun violence crisis as well.\n\nRoberto R.

So as a city, we will be stepping up and making sure that our residents have the kind of face-coverings that they need to be able to protect themselves when they go outside of their home and can\u2019t safely social distance \u2014 for example, at grocery stores,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nStarting Friday, Illinois residents will be required to wear a face covering or a mask whenever they are in public places where they cannot maintain a six-foot social distance. Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s revised stay-at-home order requires face coverings in stores and other indoor public places. It applies to \u201call individuals over the age of two who are able to medically tolerate\u201d a face-covering or mask.\n\nThe revised order applies through the month of May. But Lightfoot said she expects the mask mandate to continue for months after that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be living with masks for the duration. I see that happening certainly over the course of the summer and fall and maybe even until next year before we see a vaccine go on line,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked about specific plans to get masks to low-income Chicagoans, the mayor said she had been \u201cdoing that all along.\u201d But, Lightfoot said she has \u201cheightened those efforts\u201d through so-called \u201cracial equity rapid response teams\u201d dispatched to African-American neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of placing an order for a million face coverings for residents. Obviously, we\u2019re gonna put a premium on residents in need. We\u2019re gonna be passing out [masks] to the 50 aldermen. In the interim, we\u2019ve put masks in their hands,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier this week, dozens of aldermen lined up outside the Thompson Center for medical masks distributed by millionaire businessman Willie Wilson. A candidate for the U.S. Senate, Wilson has access to masks through his medical supply business.\n\nWilson has also tried to sell masks to the city and state at cost. But Lightfoot has accused the former mayoral challenger who endorsed her over County Board President Toni Preckwinkle of demanding to be paid cash up front. Wilson denied that.\n\nThe mad scramble to distribute masks to Chicagoans has also spurred a handful of City Council members, led by Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), one of Lightfoot\u2019s most outspoken critics, to propose using their treasured aldermanic menu money for masks.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\n\u2022 Lightfoot said she has no plans to follow New York City\u2019s lead by closing the CTA for a deep cleaning. She argued once again that the CTA is a lifeline for essential workers, who have no other way to get to their jobs.\n\n\u2022 With city revenues continuing to plummet, the mayor was asked again about the possibility of furloughs or layoffs in city government.\n\nShe reiterated that city state and federal governments should be \u201cacting as a catalyst to spur economic growth.\u201d\n\nShe called layoffs and furloughs \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and a \u201clast, last, last resort. ... Well, last is raising property taxes.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lightfoot gave a rare shout-out to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel for fiercely defending Chicago\u2019s status as a sanctuary city, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated attempts to strip sanctuary cities of federal crime-fighting funds. It happened on the day when a federal appeals court affirmed earlier rulings in Chicago\u2019s favor in that marathon court fight.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the news from our corporation counsel earlier this morning, I let out a cheer,\u201d Lightfoot said.\n\n\u201cAnd I have to give credit to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel for really understanding the importance of fighting this fight. ...

The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, but the families who endured the Civil War would see some parallels between their experiences and ours.\n\nIndeed, social distancing has unintentionally made our society into something the Civil War generation would have recognized: one clearly based on the household.\n\nOpinion\n\nMaintaining the household was always the chief priority for 19th Century families, but the absence of many fathers, husbands and brothers on the Civil War battlefront made it an even more pressing responsibility. This empowered the women left behind, but it also created a sense of being cut off from the rest of the world \u2014 a feeling we can certainly relate to today.\n\nLike us, they knew that monumental events were taking place and decisions were being made that could profoundly affect their lives. However, they had far fewer ways to learn about what was happening outside their immediate communities.\n\nWe benefit from a vast technological network designed to bring us information. This flood of data from competing sources can seem overwhelming and make us anxious about our constantly changing landscape. This anxiety would have been even greater for Civil War Americans, who similarly did not know what the crisis would bring but also had more trouble gathering even basic information about it.\n\nNewspapers were their greatest conduit to the outside world, but details were sometimes slow to arrive. Knowing a battle had been fought often wasn\u2019t enough because it didn\u2019t address their main concern. That came later \u2014 with the casualty lists. Families could wait days, or even weeks, to discover if loved ones had fallen in combat. For some, due to the lack of forensic science, it took until the end of the war to see if Johnny came marching home.\n\nSo, like us, Civil War Americans often found themselves isolated and uncertain.\n\nFortunately, their households also provided them with distractions and other ways to alleviate those conditions. Without modern appliances and technology, running the household was a laborious task \u2014 even more so with some family members off at the front. Kids had other amusements too, like games and toys \u2014 some purchased, but others made for them by relatives and friends.\n\nMiddle class families also participated in \u201cparlor culture.\u201d They would gather in the parlor \u2014 a room set aside solely for cultural pursuits \u2014 and read together, sing songs and play piano, or do various other activities that interacted with the broader culture and enriched their minds. In fact, the war itself influenced many of these activities. People bought games that simulated aspects of the war and sang songs that helped emotionally and intellectually make sense of the conflict raging around them.\n\nHouseholds reached outward during the Civil War and tried to help however they could. Basic tasks like knitting had always been prominent features of home life but became something more. Women knitted socks and garments for soldiers, along with other supplies that could be manufactured in the home.\n\nSoldier health also became a focus. Women volunteered as nurses and people gave financial support to national organizations designed to promote mental and physical health in the armies. Mary Lincoln herself visited hospitals to cheer patients, and both she and the president supported organizations that helped soldiers. We can see parallels between these efforts and ours to sew masks and donate gloves for healthcare providers or find other ways to help \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d\n\nCivil War families also provided psychological comfort to their loved ones in the ranks by constantly writing letters and sending care packages. They may not have had the internet or phones, but it\u2019s not difficult to envision this flood of letters \u2014 many of which remain with us today in repositories like the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library \u2014 as akin to text messages and emails.\n\nFor some families, the quantity of these letters far outstripped anything else they sent in their lifetimes \u2014 something we can also identify with, as social distancing motivates us to reach out via technology to family and friends we sometimes took for granted.\n\nHuman beings crave community and, even in the most trying of times, seek it out. Each Civil War household was a community unto itself, but members of those households also found ways to connect themselves with the broader community around them. Our crisis is of a different sort, but we can find inspiration and comfort in the sacrifices they made and the ingenuity they showed.\n\nChristian McWhirter, Ph.D. is the Lincoln Historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum and the author of \u201cBattle Hymns: The Power and Popularity of Music in the Civil War.\u201d\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":532,"url":"https:\/\/healthimpactnews.com\/2020\/the-war-on-cash-using-covid-19-to-make-sure-the-rich-get-richer-and-control-the-monetary-system\/","publisher":"Health Impact News","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":[],"title":"The War on Cash: Using COVID-19 to Make Sure the Rich Get Richer and Control the Monetary System?","image":"https:\/\/healthimpactnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2020\/04\/blood-money.jpg","body_text":"Comments by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThere has been much written lately about how the COVID-19 \u201cpandemic\u201d is being used as an excuse to usher in some kind of national \u201cMedical ID\u201d that could be used as a tool to control our daily activities, and be used as a requirement to do almost everything in society, from buying goods to travel to receiving medical treatment and beyond.\n\nSuch concerns are certainly legitimate given what we have seen so far in the \u201cwar against the invisible enemy\u201d and the government\u2019s reaction to this \u201cwar.\u201d\n\nBut opportunists taking advantage of the COVID-19 responses who would love to track and control most aspects of your personal life are not simply restricted to a medical ID card.\n\nI was recently in a store purchasing some grocery products, and the sign at the checkout said: \u201cDue to the Coronavirus situation we are no longer accepting cash.\u201d\n\nThis may seen like a minor inconvenience to most people, but Attorney James Rickards, an American lawyer, economist, and investment banker with 35 years of experience working in capital markets on Wall Street, has been warning about the \u201cWar on Cash\u201d for years now. When the flow of cash is limited to digital money and the approval of banks, near total control of the population is much more easily accomplished.\n\nBack in 2016 he wrote:\n\nI\u2019ve been warning investors for months about the war on cash. This war has been in full swing in Europe and the U.S. for a long time. Governments plan to use negative interest rates, confiscatory taxes and other techniques to rob savers of their wealth. In order to do this, they have to force savings into digital accounts at large government-controlled banks. As long as savers can hold cash, they can avoid many of these confiscation techniques. Therefore, governments must eliminate cash. The latest battleground in this war is India. In a shock announcement on Nov. 8, India declared that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes are no longer legal tender. Imagine that \u2014 the money in your wallet or purse is instantly made worthless by government decree. That\u2019s what happened. There were limited exceptions for hospitals and gas stations. Naturally, gas lines formed everywhere, and some people rushed to hospitals to prepay for future medical care with now worthless bank notes. The other exception to worthlessness was if you deposited the notes in the bank. There you would receive \u201cdigital credit\u201d in your account. Of course, the tax man was waiting at the bank to ask you where you got the money. Those without an acceptable answer can expect trouble from the Indian Revenue Service. this is not the end of the war on cash. It\u2019s just the beginning.

Kim Reynolds has not issued a statewide stay-at-home order, but has signed multiple proclamations continuing the State Public Health Emergency Declaration initially announced on March 17.\n\nAn April 27 proclamation continues the statewide emergency declaration through May 27, while loosening some restrictions from May 1 through May 15. As of May 15, restrictions previously loosened only in 77 counties are lifted statewide.\n\nProvisions of earlier proclamations included the temporary closure of schools and the prohibition of gatherings larger than 10 people.\n\nReynolds had extended closures and limitations for restaurants, bars and certain retail stores. Her April 6 proclamation imposed additional regulations including the closure of malls, entertainment venues, playgrounds, campgrounds, tobacco stores, museums, and libraries until April 30.\n\nReynolds also called on police to enforce the prohibition on public gatherings larger than 10 people.\n\nThe state said existing permits to carry or acquire a firearm will not expire until further notice.\n\nAn April 10 proclamation introduced additional regulatory relief measures. The provisions give health facilities greater flexibility, remove some in-person regulatory requirements and \"permit community colleges and school districts to adjust to the suspension of in-person instruction.\"\n\nReynolds announced on April 17 that schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. Instructional time requirements are waived, and schools will extend their previously-approved \"continuous learning\" plans.\n\nReynolds announced the launch of \"TestIowa,\" a public-private partnership set to increase the state's COVID-19 testing capacity by up to 3,000 additional tests per day. The state created an online health assessment, which Reynolds is encouraging even asymptomatic individuals to fill out, and is setting up drive-through testing tents.\n\nReynolds signed a proclamation allowing hospitals to resume some elective surgeries through a phased approach, and reopening farmers' markets with limited operations, beginning April 27.\n\nIn 77 of Iowa's 99 counties, restaurants, fitness centers, malls, libraries, race tracks and some retail establishments can resume limited operations if they implement public health measures, effective May 1. The proclamation also lifts restrictions on religious and spiritual gatherings if they observe safety precautions.\n\nIowa Workforce Development issued guidance on April 27 saying Iowans who are idled by temporary coronavirus-related layoffs and who refuse to return to work when recalled by their employer will lose unemployment benefits, with a few exceptions.\n\nA proclamation effective May 8 permits dental services to resume in compliance with board guidelines and permits additional establishments to resume limited operations with public health measures in place. It also adjusts school start dates, suspends certain requirements for private instruction and interscholastic athletics and provides additional professional licensure relief.\n\nCampgrounds, drive-in movie theaters, tanning facilities and medical spas can reopen statewide.\n\nIn the 77 counties with relaxed restrictions, social and fraternal clubs were ordered to remain closed except for physically-distant golfing or food and beverage service.\n\nIn the remaining 22 counties, fitness centers, health clubs and gyms were allowed to reopen on an appointment-only basis for one patron at a time. Malls can reopen at 50% capacity, but must keep seating and play areas closed. Previously-closed retail stores can open at 50% capacity and in compliance with state guidance.\n\nReynolds said on May 11 that she would follow a \"modified quarantine plan\" after visiting the White House, where two staffers tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nA proclamation effective May 15 permits salons, barbershops and massage and tattoo establishments to reopen statewide in a limited fashion, with public health measures in place.

Doug Burgum has not issued a statewide stay-at-home order.\n\nMany types of businesses were ordered closed through April 30, including recreational facilities, gyms, entertainment venues and \"all salons operated by licensed cosmetologists.\" Restaurants and bars closed to on-site patrons, but takeout and delivery services continued. Businesses can resume or continue operations in accordance with \"North Dakota Smart Restart\" protocols as of May 1.\n\nBurgum announced on May 1 that K-12 schools will continue with distance learning through the end of the academic year.\n\nBurgum issued an executive order waiving the one-week waiting period to obtain unemployment benefits, as the state saw a surge in jobless claims.\n\nIndividuals who test positive for COVID-19, and their household members, are ordered to self-quarantine in their place of residence for 14 days, according to an April 6 executive order.\n\nBurgum signed an order suspending visitation to long-term care facilities, \"except in cases of end-of-life or compassionate care circumstances,\" until further notice.\n\nBurgum signed an executive order allowing Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities and Qualified Residential Treatment Programs to make certain policy and regulatory changes in order to continue providing critical services for vulnerable youth.\n\nBurgum released the state's finalized hospital surge plan on April 14.\n\nBurgum outlined a plan to expand the state's COVID-19 testing capacity, with the goal of performing 1,800 tests per day by April 30.\n\nOn April 27, Burgum announced that he would lift certain restrictions and implement new guidelines for businesses as they continue or resume operations after the executive order expires on April 30. He has emphasized that the reopening of businesses is voluntary for those that can meet protocols, and is encouraging people to continue teleworking whenever possible.\n\nThe \"North Dakota Smart Restart\" roadmap offers universal protocols and industry-specific guidance for businesses to protect the health and safety of both workers and customers. On April 28, Burgum released guidance for sectors including restaurants, bars, salons, tattoo parlors and fitness centers. On April 29, Burgum released guidance for movie theaters.\n\nThe North Dakota Parks & Recreation Department has issued rules and timelines for easing restrictions on park use. Marinas and boat ramps opened on May 9 and 10. Campgrounds will reopen May 21 for limited-service camping. All visitor centers, concession buildings and comfort stations will be closed until Memorial Day. Site-specific equipment rentals will resume starting Memorial Day weekend. Playgrounds are closed and special events are canceled until further notice.\n\nBurgum is allowing schools to use their facilities for high school graduation ceremonies with specific safety, sanitation and social distancing protocols. The state has issued guidance, and is letting local school boards and administrators decide \"whether, when or where\" ceremonies should be held.\n\nBurgum announced that starting June 1, public and nonpublic schools will be able to host certain activities including summer school, driver's education and college admissions testing. Schools can still choose to offer summer instruction through distance learning. Students will be allowed in school buildings from May 15 to May 30 to retrieve belongings and return equipment.\n\nThe North Dakota Emergency Commission voted to utilize over $500 million in federal funding for the state's COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, with most of the money going towards economic recovery.\n\nOhio\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota has no statewide stay-at-home order. Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order through May 31 that strengthens the language used to require South Dakotans to practice CDC-recommended hygiene practices and social distancing. It also orders businesses and local and municipal governments to restrict gatherings of 10 or more people, tells employers to encourage staff to telework and social distance, and requires health care organizations to postpone all nonessential elective surgeries.\n\nNoem also ordered adults over the age of 65, and anyone with certain underlying medical conditions, in Minnehaha and Lincoln counties to stay home. There are exceptions for critical infrastructure jobs and essential errands. The order expired on May 11, though Noem said she would revisit it if necessary.\n\nHealth care providers are instructed to postpone nonessential elective surgeries.\n\nNoem signed into law a bill that allows for injunctions to enforce directives or orders for the containment of a coronavirus respiratory syndrome.\n\nElections to be held between April 14 and May 26 have been postponed.\n\nRequirements that students take national standardized tests have been waived.\n\nThe state has created a small business economic disaster relief subfund that can make appropriations.\n\nOn April 9, Noem extended her previous executive orders through May 31.\n\nSchools are ordered to remain closed and continue with \"distance learning\" through the end of the academic year.\n\nNoem signed an executive order removing barriers to licensure for health care professionals and expanding access to telehealth.\n\nAfter nearly 300 workers at the Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Sioux Falls tested positive for COVID-19, Noem asked the company to temporarily suspend operations. Ken Sullivan, Smithfield's CEO and president, announced on April 12 that the plant would shut down indefinitely. Noem said she was working with the CDC and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to safely reopen it. The CDC released its finalized report on April 23. The plant began a partial reopening on May 4.\n\nNoem signed an executive order on April 20 giving hog producers temporarily flexibility in their state and county regulatory operations.\n\nAt an April 21 press conference, Noem encouraged people not to attend two upcoming auto races that had sold hundreds of tickets, but did not opt to take more restrictive action. The speedways later decided to hold the races without spectators present.\n\nThe governor's Small Business Relief Fund announced its first 94 recipients, totaling more than $5 million in loans.\n\nOn April 28, Noem announced the \"Back to Normal\" plan, which outlines guidance for individuals, schools, employers, health care providers and local governments. She also signed an executive order putting the plan into effect.\n\nAn executive order effective through May 31 provides guidance regarding how the \"Back to Normal\" plan will apply to state government. Cabinet secretaries and bureau commissioners have the authority to call employees back to the office, though administrative leave is still allowed for employees who cannot come in and cannot work remotely. Approved out-of-state work-related travel is allowed.\n\nNoem signed an executive order suspending a statute related to the renewal of certain alcoholic beverage licenses.\n\nOfficials announced that South Dakota is ramping up testing of vulnerable populations, and will begin testing all residents and staff at nursing homes and assisted living facilities statewide beginning May 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nThe first version of this page was originally published on March 12.

She made a difference.\n\nTorrence Jones remembers the day his girlfriend Michelle Abernathy learned a developmentally disabled resident of Ludeman Developmental Center, where they worked, had become the first person there to test positive for COVID-19.\n\nIt was March 28, a Saturday. Abernathy had stopped by the Park Forest campus to catch up on work. She was informed the stricken man lived in a housing unit under her supervision.\n\nAbernathy, 52, made sure the resident was receiving proper care and that her staff had personal protective equipment, Jones said.\n\nBy the next night, Abernathy had a fever. Fifteen days later, she was dead, a victim of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Human Services revealed this past week that the death toll at Ludeman has reached six \u2014 three staff members and three residents.\n\nThe latest to die: Jose Velez and Cephus Lee. They worked in Ludeman\u2019s dietary department, delivering meals from a central kitchen to the 38 residential homes that comprise the facility.\n\nLudeman has been hit harder than the other 13 state-operated residential and hospital sites that care for people with developmental disabilities and mental health needs. As of Thursday, 155 of its 344 residents had tested positive, with 91 awaiting results. The rest tested negative.\n\nOfficials say most of those residents haven\u2019t had any symptoms, and there\u2019s hope the worst has passed.\n\nIt\u2019s a brighter picture than what\u2019s happening in nursing homes around the state, where the death toll is much higher for similarly situated residents \u2014 though advocates say the state isn\u2019t reporting COVID data on thousands of disabled individuals in private, nonprofit residential facilities that are state-licensed.\n\nSixty-eight of 892 Ludeman employees have tested positive, but union officials say testing has been limited. They\u2019re pressing to get tests offered onsite for all workers. The state is working to do that, a spokesperson said.\n\nWhile my heart goes out to everyone at Ludeman affected by the outbreak, I\u2019m concentrating on the staff in part because it\u2019s difficult to imagine the terror that would come from seeing three coworkers drop dead in two weeks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question they\u2019re concerned,\u201d said Anne Irving, who works with Ludeman\u2019s staff as regional director of AFSCME Council 31.\n\nIrving said that concern is directed as much as anything toward the residents, with whom they\u2019ve developed deep relationships.\n\nCaring for developmentally disabled people is demanding in the best of times, heroic in a pandemic. These are jobs that do not allow for social distancing.\n\nMost Ludeman residents have serious medical conditions or severe behavioral problems in addition to developmental disabilities. More than half are nonverbal.\n\nThat means hands-on work for the staff that can include feeding and bathing residents and helping them get dressed in addition to keeping them engaged and entertained to help pass time under quarantine.\n\nMany residents don\u2019t understand the need to be isolated in their rooms because of the highly infectious disease, said Sarah Ross, whose younger sister Kathy has lived at Ludeman for 34 of the past 37 years.\n\n\u201cThey are the angels and heroes of this community,\u201d Ross said of Ludeman\u2019s staff.\n\nAbernathy had started her job last fall after 20 years as an investigator for the state Department of Children and Family Services, looking out for abused and neglected children.\n\n\u201cI could see the love she had for these individuals,\u201d said Jones, who started dating Abernathy after training her for the position.\n\nWith a bachelor\u2019s degree from Chicago State and master\u2019s from Sparta College, Abernathy was very involved with her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, but always made time to watch the Bears \u2014 and Dallas Cowboys \u2014 play, Jones said.\n\nThey lived together in Chatham and planned to get engaged.\n\nI wish I could tell you more about Velez and Lee, but I don\u2019t know much. Velez worked for the agency for 30 years. Lee, 59, formerly of Markham, was there less than two years.\n\nRoss said Ludeman has a continuing need for masks, gloves and gowns because the staff goes through so much each day. She asked me to plead for donations.\n\n\u201cAt times, it seems we are a forgotten community,\u201d she said.\n\nNot today.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":546,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/1\/21244240\/chick-fil-a-meal-kits-amid-coronavirus-stay-at-home-mandates-covid-19","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-01","author":[],"title":"Chick-fil-A to offer meal kits amid coronavirus stay-at-home mandates","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/it39PmDrcyTax3LX_CA4fBr7RB0=\/0x41:760x439\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19937916\/Screen_Shot_2020_05_01_at_11.36.18_AM.png","body_text":"Chick-fil-A will offer make-it-yourself chicken parmesan meal kits starting Monday as more people decide to eat at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe fast-food chain\u2019s meal kits are additions to the regular menu of sandwiches, salads and other fare.

It became even more bizarre today when many IDNR sites eopened on a limited basis.\n\nI mean many, as in many more than originally posted as reopening.\n\n(At the bottom, I also have an update, which I learned late today, on Hennepin-Hopper lakes at Dixon Waterfowl Refuge, one of my favorite spots in Illinois.)\n\nAs bizarre as the situation was with northeastern Illinois sites, it was nothing compared to the massive changes that went on with reopenings in southern Illinois. Click here for the latest lists of what was or is supposed to be reopened across Illinois.\n\nThe most bizarre part of today may be Heidecke Lake, the former cooling lake near Morris. It was literally decided to reopen it today, because it is part of Goose Lake Prairie. I briefly considered heading out there when I found out, but instead stuck with the reopening of Kankakee River State Park.\n\nThe other bizarre part is the state of North Point Marina. It\u2019s listed as officially closed, but, for all practical purposes, appears to be functioning as if open. I am still trying to sort that one out officially and unofficially.\n\nNot sure when this happened, but Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area reopened on Friday, a much needed opening to ease pressure on other sites. (Rock Cut SP also unexpectedly is listed as reopened.)\n\nUnrelated to the coronavirus, Illinois Beach SP did not reopen today because of flooding and storm damage.\n\nNow, to Hennepin-Hopper lakes at Dixon Waterfowl Refuge near Hennepin. Paul Botts, president and executive director of The Wetlands Initiative, called and emailed late this afternoon with an update on what is happening with an experimental three-day access trial in mid-May.\n\nIn a follow-up phone call, he indicated rather certainly that he expects fishing to come back this year, but obviously that depends on lots of things.\n\nHere is the email update:\n\nOn Tuesday, May 19 through Thursday, May 21, the Dixon Waterfowl Refuge will be open to visitors from dawn to dusk for a trial run of public access during the COVID-19 epidemic. We\u2019re glad so many people treasure and enjoy this special place. Thank you for your understanding as we navigate this unusual and unprecedented time. Only the trails will be open on these days. The lakes will remain closed to paddling and fishing at this time. Please practice social distancing and stay at least 6 feet away from other people including TWI staff doing restoration and stewardship work. Of course the standard rules for visiting, which are posted at the Refuge, also still apply. As always, parking is allowed only in the official lots. If all parking spaces are filled, please visit the Refuge at another time. No portable toilets will be available so plan your visit accordingly. If all goes well during the three-day trial run and it\u2019s clear that we can protect the health of both visitors and staff, we aim to keep public access moving forward into the summer. We\u2019re hoping that everyone together can make this possible!\n\nI sure hope it opens up. It is one of the great fishing spots in Illinois, but I love it even more just for the audacity of its concept and execution as a restoration project. If I am in the area, I climb the tower to check out the site or do some hiking.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":549,"url":"https:\/\/slate.com\/business\/2020\/05\/haircut-salon-safe-coronavirus.html","publisher":"Slate","publish_date":"2020-05-01","author":"['Aaron Mak']","title":"How to make it safe to get a haircut.","image":"https:\/\/compote.slate.com\/images\/be4f7b14-0239-40dc-92e2-8b1d5991e8c9.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0","body_text":"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images Plus.\n\nThis is the first installment of Reopenings, a series about how businesses are operating during the pandemic.\n\nIn a few parts of the country, it is possible once again to pay someone to fix your split ends and shaggy sideburns. As part of the limited reopenings of their economies, Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wyoming are or will soon be allowing hair salons and barber shops to operate as long as they follow certain social distancing measures. Already these businesses are finding that their services have been missed. Brooke McLaughlin, who co-owns the Taylor Brooks Hair Salon & Spa in Johns Creek, Georgia, said that her stylists have had to fix a lot of unmaintained hair and botched DIY jobs during their first week back in business. \u201cIt was horrendous. A lot of our men tried to cut the sides of their hair, and they couldn\u2019t blend the tops to the sides. Bless them; they were trying really hard, so A for effort,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of roots were really overgrown as far as coloring goes for my female clients.\u201d\n\nWhat is it like to get a haircut during a pandemic? For one obvious thing, it\u2019s impossible for a business that involves hand-to-hair contact to stick to the six-feet-of-distance guidelines that are a mainstay of coronavirus lockdowns across the country. \u201cYou\u2019re maximizing your ability to be safe in an environment that arguably can\u2019t be made totally safe,\u201d said Leslie Roste, the director of education for the salon disinfectant company Barbicide, who has been working with states to develop reopening guidelines for salons. \u201cEverybody is within six feet of each other, touching strangers all day long. If you\u2019re cutting my hair, you\u2019re standing behind me, breathing on me.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of having stylists stand six feet away from clients, many businesses have instead limited the number of customers they let in at a time, requiring appointments, avoiding double bookings, putting safety markings on the floor at six-foot intervals so that some distancing can take place, and seating clients farther apart from one another as they have their haircuts. The Three-13 Salon, Spa & Boutique in Marietta, Georgia, has also been careful about whom they\u2019ve let in to their building since reopening last week. According to managing partner Lester Crowell, the salon has been asking customers a list of diagnostic questions\u2014like whether they were living with anyone sick during quarantine\u2014and having them submit to a temperature check before they can enter. Employees are also required to wear pink stickers around the workplace to indicate that they\u2019ve undergone their daily temperature check and aren\u2019t running a fever.\n\nThe cosmetology industry already has fairly strict sanitation rules. Between each appointment, stylists have to immerse their haircut tools in a disinfectant solution for a certain amount of time, launder towels and linens, and wash their hands, among other steps. Some establishments are now instituting additional cleaning measures. Stylists at Taylor Brooks have been bleaching the shampoo bowls and applying Lysol spray to all the chairs the moment a client is finished. Three-13 has been making appointment windows longer so that stylists have more time to clean up between customers and is starting to drape disposable capes on its clients instead of reusing them. The salon also has cleaners in hazmat suits come in every week to cover everything in a chlorinated disinfectant spray.\n\nThree-13 and Taylor Brooks are instructing employees to wear masks while working. They\u2019ve also been asking that all customers have masks while patronizing their establishments, though this can be an obstacle for beauticians. \u201cMy first day back, a client had a mask that went around the back of the head,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cSomething that I was very used to doing from muscle memory for 20 years I had to rethink.\u201d To ensure scalp access, she shifted the strap above and below the hairline as she snipped away, all while trying to ensure that the mask stayed in place. Masks that hang around people\u2019s ears are easier because the customer can remove one strap at a time so that the stylist can cut their sideburns.\n\nMasks are also particularly inconvenient for facials and waxing, since those services generally require unobstructed access to the face. Three-13 has its customers maneuver their masks around their face so stylists can wax stray lip hairs. Facials are even tougher. \u201cFor a facial, you\u2019ve pretty much got to take it off,\u201d said Crowell. \u201cYou can hold it to your nose and mouth a little, and we do that, but it\u2019s difficult.\u201d Taylor Brooks is opting not to do lip waxing at the moment. The salon is also making only one aesthetician available for facials, for which customers may remove their masks. The aesthetician, who wears a face mask and shield herself, performs the facials for one person at a time in a room that\u2019s closed off from the rest of the building.\n\nSalons are also altering or even doing away with waiting rooms and the associated amenities to further limit the risk of infection. Three-13 reduced its indoor waiting room to two ottomans and is having most customers sit on spaced-out folding chairs on an outdoor veranda. The restrictions in general also mean fewer clients can come. Before the outbreak, the salon would normally see 250 people on a Friday and 350 on a Saturday. This last week it saw 100 on Friday and 120 on Saturday.\n\nAt Taylor Brooks, which has been \u201cbooked solid,\u201d employees threw away all the magazines, removed the coffee bar, and packed up all the furniture where customers used to be able to lounge before their appointments. Now they just wait in their cars. The business is also asking customers not to touch any retail hair products they wish to purchase.\n\nTaken together, these safety procedures will clearly make the experience of getting a haircut far more impersonal. Roste predicts that for a while it will be harder to follow the time-honored traditions of gabbing with locals at the barbershop or decompressing with your favorite stylist. \u201cThis has always been considered sort of a luxury service. It\u2019s supposed to be a downtime where you have a service that makes you feel better when you walk out,\u201d she said, adding that the rigid guidelines may make the atmosphere a bit more clinical and businesslike. \u201cA lot of that social aspect may have to go away. That makes me sad, but I think in the short term that people will have to be much more cautious.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":551,"url":"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/science\/medical-dispatch\/the-essential-workers-filling-new-yorks-coronavirus-wards","publisher":"The New Yorker","publish_date":"2020-05-01","author":"['Dhruv Khullar']","title":"The Essential Workers Filling New York\u2019s Coronavirus Wards","image":"https:\/\/media.newyorker.com\/photos\/5eab540969e8cb02813d5a0d\/16:9\/w_1280,c_limit\/Khullar-EssentialWorkers.jpg","body_text":"The diversity of New York is on full display in its hospital rooms. Some days, I organize my rounds not by where patients are located but by what language they speak: Spanish, Chinese, English, Creole. That way, I can keep the same interpreter on the phone as I make my way from room to room. One in five Americans speaks a language other than English at home; half of New Yorkers do.\n\nOne morning, I gown up and step inside a patient\u2019s room, the interpreter on speakerphone in my scrubs pocket. The patient is a deliveryman I admitted earlier that week; his breathing has worsened each day, requiring escalating doses of oxygen via nasal cannula, and now a face mask. I must tell him that, should his breathing worsen further, the next step will be intubation.\n\nI speak carefully, in short paragraphs, pausing to allow the interpreter to translate. The man stares at me from behind his mask, waiting to learn what his future holds. Thirty seconds after I stop talking, as the interpreter completes her translation, his dark eyes widen, and slow recognition spreads across his face.\n\nHe asks what intubation entails, and I explain. Again a delay; again the unwelcome news starts to register. He asks how long he\u2019ll remain on the ventilator. We can\u2019t know for sure, I say, but I hope it\u2019s not long. Tears escape his eyes and his breathing quickens. I worry that the conversation itself will tip him into extremis. During the coronavirus pandemic, I\u2019ve avoided entering rooms more than once a day, but today I vow to return.\n\nOutside, I rub foam sanitizer into my hands and remove my face shield. I forget that the interpreter is still on the line.\n\n\u201cWill that be all, doctor?\u201d she says, a minute later, from my pocket.\n\n\u201cYeah, thank you,\u201d I reply. \u201cThat was pretty rough, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been a lot of those conversations lately.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, social distancing is working. The virus has claimed at least twelve thousand lives, but single-day deaths have declined steadily since April 7th, when nearly five hundred and sixty people died of COVID-19. New cases and hospitalizations have also fallen in recent weeks, even though many hospitals remain nearly full.\n\nBut, as this wave of the coronavirus starts to slow, I can\u2019t help but notice that many of the people still getting infected are those who don\u2019t have the luxury of distance\u2014those who, by necessity or by trade, expose themselves and their families to the virus every day. We\u2019re now debating whether it\u2019s safe to reopen the economy, but for essential workers it never closed. Each morning, during the apex of the deadliest pandemic in a century, these men and women have been venturing out into the epicenter of disease, to cook and clean, deliver food and carry mail, drive buses and stock shelves, patrol the streets and tend to the ill. Many have paid with their health\u2014some with their lives.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming clear that essential workers experience a disproportionate share of death and disease owing to COVID-19. During one week not long ago, I cared for a police officer, a grocery-store clerk, and a bus driver. During another, my clinical service of fifteen patients included three food deliverymen. (The last time I can recall caring for a delivery worker was more than two years ago: his leg was broken after he was hit by an S.U.V. at a busy Manhattan intersection.)\n\nThe burden falls unevenly among racial and ethnic groups: in New York City, people of color comprise three-quarters of the city\u2019s essential workers. Three-fifths of cleaning workers are Latino; more than forty per cent of public-transit workers are black. Latinos comprise twenty-nine per cent of the city\u2019s population, but thirty-four per cent of all cases; black people are twenty-two per cent of the population but represent twenty-eight per cent of COVID-19 deaths. Many factors contribute. Communities of color have higher rates of poverty, housing instability, and chronic disease. They\u2019re more likely to consist of dense or multigenerational households, in which the virus spreads more easily. These communities have experienced frequent, sometimes egregious, bias from the health-care system, which has engendered lasting mistrust and leads some people to forgo needed care.\n\nIn a pandemic, just going to work is risky. \u201cAll one has to do is stand on a platform and you\u2019ll see that the trains are filled with black and brown and low-income people going into communities to service those who are able to telecommute,\u201d Eric Adams, Brooklyn\u2019s borough president, recently said. (About a hundred of the city\u2019s public-transit workers have died of COVID-19 since the first M.T.A. worker death was reported, on March 26th.) And yet many essential workers have little choice but to stay on the job during the pandemic\u2014either because they can\u2019t afford to take time off or because they\u2019re told that they aren\u2019t allowed to. One study found that fifty-five per cent of retail and food-service workers, many of whom have been declared essential, have no paid sick leave, and fewer than ten per cent of them can take two weeks off\u2014the recommended COVID-19 quarantine period.\n\nThe basic process by which doctors collect a medical history has not changed in a century. You start with a patient\u2019s \u201cchief complaint\u201d\u2014the primary reason for seeking medical care. You make your way through the \u201chistory of present illness,\u201d exploring the onset, pace, character, and severity of symptoms. (When exactly did that cough start? What color is your phlegm? Does your chest hurt more when breathing deeply or walking quickly?) Then you move to pre\u00ebxisting conditions, medications, and allergies.\n\nTucked somewhere down below is the social history. At its best, the social history is how we explore who patients are as individuals\u2014how their jobs and hobbies and lives intersect with their current predicaments. It\u2019s meant to illuminate how nonmedical factors may have contributed to illness, but also to give us a more complete understanding of what\u2019s important to the person we\u2019re caring for. For busy doctors, though, it\u2019s often reduced to a few mechanical questions: Do you smoke? Drink alcohol? Do drugs? The entire social history in a doctor\u2019s note might read, \u201cNo toxic habits.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s turning out that, in this pandemic, social history is profoundly important. As we learn more about the epidemiology of the virus, I find myself exploring these details with great interest. Where do you live? How many rooms? How many people are in those rooms? Does your work require you to come in close contact with others? The answers reveal how much risk specific households and families are shouldering.\n\nOne of the many new faces in my hospital belongs to Khalid Haynes, a softspoken African-American man in his mid-twenties. COVID-19 has created administrative demands in addition to clinical ones; Haynes is one of many new patient co\u00f6rdinators who have arrived to keep the hospital running. (Other new hires have been helping to build new I.C.U.s, or transfer patients between facilities.) He began his career as a personal trainer, before starting work as a patient co\u00f6rdinator at an integrative-health clinic. There, he answered phones, greeted patients, and verified insurance; as the coronavirus began to spread across the city, his clinic turned to telemedicine, and he began working remotely. In late March, he received a call from his manager saying that he was being dispatched to the hospital as an essential worker. In his new role, he\u2019d help troubleshoot and distribute iPads to doctors, so that their patients could see their families.\n\nHaynes has kind eyes, horn-rimmed glasses, and an easygoing charm. During our first encounter, I rushed past in a pre-caffeine daze, and he stopped me to ask about my day, insisting on a genuine answer. Two weeks after he started at the hospital, his grandmother died of COVID-19. \u201cThat gave me a really painful perspective on how important this role is,\u201d he told me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see my grandmother before she died. I don\u2019t want that to happen to anyone else.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":557,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/1\/21244812\/ppp-payroll-protection-program-sba-coronavirus-loans-freightcar-broadwind-energy-gibsons-steakhouses","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-01","author":"['Lauren Fitzpatrick', 'Tim Novak']","title":"Chicago area companies getting COVID-19 loans include railcar maker that paid CEO $2.1M","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/67wA1ubeNxRxgAsWOMZZ2U58BzE=\/0x115:1600x953\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19938916\/Virus_Outbreak_Trump.jpg","body_text":"Faced with the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump quickly rolled out the Paycheck Protection Program, aiming to keep workers on the payroll at small businesses as business dwindled because of the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nAmong the Chicago-area companies to benefit, records show, were:\n\nA railcar manufacturer \u2014 which secured the maximum $10 million \u2014 that closed a factory in Virginia last year and opened a new one in Mexico while paying its CEO $2.1 million in total compensation.\n\nA clean-energy company in Cicero that told shareholders when it announced its $9.5 million loan that COVID-19 hadn\u2019t harmed its business.\n\nTwo companies that employ thousands of workers \u2014 well over the program\u2019s usual 500-employee limit, though businesses also can qualify based on net worth or net income.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this past week that the rules that had allowed publicly traded corporations and other big companies to quickly deplete the initial $349 billion pot \u2014 shutting out many mom-and-pop operations \u2014 needed tightening. He warned publicly held companies that got more than $2 million through the coronavirus stimulus program that they would be audited. And he has asked large enterprises to voluntarily give back the money or possiblly face criminal charges if found to have cheated.\n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, requires that \u201cborrowers still must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary,\u201d taking into account access to cash and credit. \u201cFor example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,\u201d the Trump administration said April 23.\n\nThe SBA won\u2019t disclose who got the bailout money. But some large national franchises have said they\u2019ll give back the money they got after reports disclosed that. Among them: Potbelly, the Chicago-based sandwich giant.\n\nThe loans were part of a $2 trillion coronavirus-relief package Congress passed in March. In part, they were to cover fixed costs like rent and utilities, but the bulk of the money for companies under 500 workers was to keep people on the payroll. Another $321 billion has since been added to the program.\n\nIllinois businesses, including the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times, secured about 69,000 loans through April 16 totaling $15.9 billion, according to SBA data.\n\nEight publicly traded companies in Illinois have disclosed their participation. Altogether, they\u2018ve collected more than $38 million in the low-interest loans:\n\nFreightCar International, a Chicago manufacturer of rail cars, received the maximum $10 million on April 16. The president of the company, which has 496 employees, was in line in 2019 for $2.1 million in total compensation, including a $750,000 bonus, according to its filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThat same year, as it reported $229.9 million in revenue and a net loss of $75.2 million, the company closed a plant in Virginia, then leased a manufacturing facility in Mexico that\u2019s set to open later this year. FreightCar also eliminated medical and vision insurance for retirees and their dependents as of Jan 1, telling shareholders that saved $6.6 million.\n\nCompany representatives didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBroadwind Energy, a Cicero manufacturer of clean-energy equipment, received $9.5 million even as it reported earlier in April that it had $12.5 million in available credit and nearly as much in cash.\n\n\u201cWe did not experience significant impacts from the novel coronavirus disease in the first quarter of 2020, in part, because our facilities currently operate as essential businesses,\u201d the publicly traded company, which has 521 employees, reported in securities filings April 13.\n\nJason Bonfigt, Broadwind Energy\u2019s vice president, said Friday that changed in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWithout the support of the PPP loan, there was a strong likelihood that we would have had to consider targeted cost reductions, including a reduction-in-force of valued staff,\u201d Bonfigt said. \u201cBroadwind met all of the requirements set forth by the U.S. treasury to apply for the PPP loan and did so in good faith, ensuring continued employment for our workers during a period of widespread economic uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe SBA permits some businesses, such as restaurants, to treat each location as a separate entity. That allowed the Gibsons steakhouse chain in Chicago to get a loan.\n\n\u201cWe applied for it and were fortunate to get some relief,\u201d Gibsons chairman Stephen Lombardo III says, though he would not disclose how much money the company got.\n\nLombardo says that about 1,800 of Gibsons\u2019 2,000 workers have gone back to work at its 10 restaurants, which are offering takeout meals during the shutdown.\n\nSigmaTron International Inc. of Elk Grove Village, which has more than 3,106 employees worldwide, got $6.3 million on April 23, according to its federal filings.\n\nUnknown: how many of those employees work at the company\u2019s factories in Mexico, Vietnam and China.\n\nContributing: Frank Main","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":564,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/cubs\/2020\/5\/2\/21244748\/cubs-chicago-coronavirus-wrigley-field-2020","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-02","author":"['Steve Greenberg']","title":"The Cubs have seen it all over the years \u2014 and that\u2019s just on the second day of May","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/M5XfFlKbpAGf_uf1UsqEx2IxE3w=\/0x0:1222x640\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19938819\/1124590164.jpg.jpg","body_text":"Of all the dates in the history of the Chicago Cubs, May 2 is one of them.\n\nI know. Try to hold on to your hats after that explosive opening sentence.\n\nLook, the Cubs have been around since Methuselah. Any date on the calendar is rich with history about their exploits, many of them not so wonderful.\n\nBut there\u2019s something about May 2 . . .\n\nWhere to start? On this date in 1917, Cubs lefty Hippo Vaughn threw a nine-inning no-hitter against the Reds at Weeghman Park, which eventually would become Wrigley Field. One slight problem: Reds righty Fred Toney also threw a no-hitter, and his lasted for 10 innings. Indeed, the Cubs lost, in the only double-no-no of its kind ever.\n\nOn this date in 1956, Cubs third baseman Don Hoak struck out six times against the New York Giants at Wrigley. It remains tied in the big-league record book for the most strikeouts in a single game \u2014 only Hoak made his achievement extra special by fanning against six different Giants pitchers. Sure, it took him 17 innings to make all that magic happen, but the man was determined.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t all about bad outcomes, in case you were beginning to wonder. May 2 has seen, for one thing, a bunch of walk-off winners by the Cubs at Wrigley.\n\nIn 1958, they beat the Milwaukee Braves 8-7 on Walt Moryn\u2019s ninth-inning homer. Official attendance that day: 5,751.\n\nTwo years later, the Cubs gave up three runs to the Phillies in the top of the ninth, falling behind 7-5. But they responded with three of their own, winning the game when Don Zimmer knocked home Ernie Banks with a single to center. Attendance: 2,807.\n\nIn 1978, the Wrigley ramps were darn near overrun by an official crowd of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 6,990. When Manny Trillo doubled off the Dodgers\u2019 Mike Garman to score Rudy Meoli with the game-winner in the ninth . . . bedlam, we\u2019re sure.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, there was even more excitement on the second of May in 1998, when 38,430 cheered as Sammy Sosa doubled to deep left off Kent Bottenfield with two outs in the ninth to score Mark Grace from first and defeat the rival Cardinals.\n\nCould we look back on most any day from April into September and find moments like these? Perhaps. But try telling that to the great Billy Williams, who on May 2, 1961, went 4-for-4 with a grand slam against the Giants. You can bet he still remembers a day that fine, and probably many more folks than were actually in the puny crowd of 3,334 claimed to be there to witness it.\n\nIn 1976, the Cubs won each game of a doubleheader at San Francisco in extra innings \u2014 the teams played 14 and 11, respectively. And not only that, but the games ended with identical scores of 6-5. What a crazy turn of events that was.\n\nBut the man who drove home the winning run in the second game of that doubleheader \u2014 terrific Cub Randy Hundley \u2014 couldn\u2019t recall that at-bat when reached this week at his home in Palatine. For the record, it was a pinch-hit sacrifice fly off Greg Minton that scored Dave Rosello.\n\n\u201cI sure don\u2019t,\u201d Hundley said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t playing much by then anyway. My legs were giving out on me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true. That was the very last RBI of Hundley\u2019s career.\n\nHundley, now 78, sure wishes he could be watching baseball now. He rarely misses a Cubs game in person or, more often, on TV. In non-pandemic times, mind you.\n\n\u201cThis virus is something incredible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cWho would\u2019ve ever thought of such a thing?\u201d\n\nWho could\u2019ve imagined it, say, one year ago today? Last May 2, the Cubs were off after winning four straight on the road against the Diamondbacks and Mariners. A day later, they\u2019d begin a three-game sweep of the first-place Cardinals at Wrigley, by the end of which the Cubs would have a half-game lead in the division. The Cubs would remain atop for the remainder of the month.\n\nOn that pleasant note, hey, enjoy the rest of your May 2. And be ready \u2014 you never know what might happen.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":575,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/farmers-coronavirus-pandemic-china-tariffs-relief-60-minutes-2020-05-03\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-03","author":"['Lesley Stahl']","title":"Why are hundreds of people in big cities receiving bailout money meant for farmers?","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/05\/03\/36700203-1a3a-4e51-b2e2-c90534c506f3\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/64e49db0588d450bafcc97d75f394aca\/farmarticle.jpg","body_text":"Over the coming months, the government will disburse a $19 billion bailout package for farmers hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. To understand who would benefit from this new bailout, we took a close look at another recent bailout for farmers: the $28 billion program, administered without congressional oversight over the last two years and meant to offset damages from President Trump's trade war with China. We wanted to know, where did the money go?\n\nAs it turns out, most of it bypassed the country's traditional small and medium-sized farms that were battered by the loss of their export market and which are now being hit with severe losses from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota is soybean, corn and wheat country, and right now it's reeling.\n\nA farm in South Dakota\n\nBob Kuylen: If people are-- are really wanting to jump off a building about what the stock market is doing, we've been doing that for three years now. We did everything right. We raised great crops. But we're still losing our rear ends because, uh, because of what's happening with-- with\u2014the sanctions. And now with the Coronavirus, it's gonna be another hit, without a doubt.\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: So imagine three years ago, you lost 30% of your paycheck and then the next year, you lost another 30%. I mean, that's the pain we're feeling.\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke and Bob Kuylen oversee the farmers unions in North and South Dakota with more than 50,000 farmers and livestock producers. The average farm here is less than 1,500 acres.\n\n\n\nWe interviewed them remotely.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: What is happening to your farmers with this virus?\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: It's just accelerating the problem. And we are, um, not being able to sell because everyone's worried if the plants are gonna stay open.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: And restaurants closing and\u2026\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: Yeah, yeah. The food is starting to back up. Uh, the freezers are getting full. Restaurants aren't buying. So yeah, it's really becoming a huge issue for us.\n\nWith restaurants and schools closed across the country, their markets are shrinking. It's adding to already rising debt and farm bankruptcies aggravated by the trade war with China. They told us the bailout, called the Market Facilitation Program that began in 2018, helped them survive the last two years but didn't come close to covering most of their members' losses or their own.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: How did the tariffs, the sanctions affect you?\n\n\n\nBob Kuylen: About $70,000 a year I lost in the last couple of years.\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: On our farm, we've lost-- in the last, uh, three years, roughly $125,000 to $200,000 a year.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: But what about the bailouts? You had two rounds. This was supposed to tide you over.\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: Yeah.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: Did it?\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: Well, it made the banker happy. It didn't do anything for me.\n\nBob Kuylen and Doug Sombke\n\nLesley Stahl: We've seen reports of suicides going up among farmers.\n\n\n\nBob Kuylen: Oh, yeah. I know personally families that are suffering through that. The-- the stresses out there now, it's just-- they're out there for four or five generations of their family and they're the ones that lost the farm? What do you think that's gonna do to their-- their mind?\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: Yeah a lot of depression. And, just this past year in my hometown, we've-- we've lost three young men to suicide. It's-- it's just hard, Lesley, because you see these young guys coming up and, you know, and-- and you've coached them in baseball. You-- you-- you have had hopes that-- you're glad they stayed in the community and then you end up seeing this happen. And, none of their fault. Not any of their fault. And it's hard. And I worry about my kids. My-- my sons are on the farm and I worry about them all the time.\n\nAfter President Trump imposed the stringent tariffs in 2018, China struck back hard here in the Farm Belt -- imposing its own steep tariffs, especially impacting soybeans, our largest agricultural export to China, and sending commodity prices into a freefall. The administration tapped a Depression-era fund for agriculture and provided $28 billion for farmers, almost $3 billion to purchase surpluses for food banks and other nutrition programs and more than $24 billion in direct aid to farmers.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: \"We will ensure the farmers get the relief they need. And very, very quickly. It's a good time to be a farmer, we're going to make sure of that.\"\n\n\n\nBut so far, most of the money has gone to the biggest farms - one-third of it to just 4% of them. Even farm owners who personally report nearly $1 million in income per year are eligible.\n\nWe spoke to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in March, in the early days of the pandemic before social distancing was the norm. He defended the trade war bailout and the payments to farmers that were based on the amount of crops produced in 2018; and by planted acreage in 2019.\n\nSonny Perdue: It's not a welfare program. It's not a subsidy. It's not a price-support system. It is a market-damage system. A disruption there.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: These payments are disproportionately going to the big, wealthy farms at the expense of the smaller farms where the suffering is.\n\n\n\nSonny Perdue: The fact is, Lesley, most of our production in America is done by large farmers. That's just the way it happens. These are-- these are awards based on the production. And-- but we did try. We've got payment limits that cut people off.\n\nSen. Grassley: I tried to limit farm subsidy recipients\n\nBut the payment limits don't always cut people off. The limit, or the cap, designed specifically for the biggest operators, used to be $125,000 per person or legal entity. But that was raised last year to $250,000.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: But why did you double the cap? The limit?\n\n\n\nSonny Perdue: We saw the amount of trade damage that was happening here. The need was out there in order to keep these farmers where they could continue. Not be made whole, but to continue to survive to farm again the next year.\n\n\n\nKen Cook: They made changes for the very largest farmers. If you're a small farmer, you don't have to worry about the limits. You're gonna not come close to hitting them. But large farmers, they changed it so that a husband could get $250,000. His wife could get $250,000.\n\n\n\nKen cook is the president of the Environmental Working Group that's been tracking farm subsidies for decades and now the direct payments to farmers under the Trump administration's bailout.\n\n\n\nThe USDA data Cook obtained through a search of public records show farms are actually collecting millions of dollars \u2013 way over the cap. They do it by exploiting permissive eligibility rules that the administration adopted from Congress' farm bills. Those rules allow big farms to collect maximum payments on behalf of not just the farmer, but many others.\n\n\n\nKen Cook: Cousins, uncles, aunts.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: So let's say I have a cousin who's a farmer. And I'm a reporter in New York. I sit here. I don't do any farming. But I'm a cousin.\n\n\n\nKen Cook: That's right.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: I can get money?\n\n\n\nKen Cook: You can get money. Maybe you have to make a phone call a couple times a year to find out what--\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: But I don't have to even go there?\n\n\n\nKen Cook: No, you don't have to live on the farm or visit the farm. These payments aren't just going to farmers who are out there climbing up on a tractor every morning. These payments are going to people who are living in the middle of New York City because they happen to have an ownership interest in the farm.\n\nKen Cook\n\nMany farms today have investors - call them absentee owners - who also collect bailout money. When we checked, we found hundreds of recipients living in big cities including New York City, Miami, San Francisco. Among them, a banker, an architect, a composer, a classical musician.\n\nNot South Dakota's Doug Sombke's idea of a farmer.\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: I mean, my sons are the ones out here working. They're the ones that should get the money. If you've got dirt under your fingernails, you're the ones that should be getting the money, nobody else.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: But doesn't the money come to the farm?\n\n\n\nDoug Sombke: No, it can go anywhere. They can distribute it as the corporation sees fit, right?\n\n\n\nKen Cook: If you're a very large farm operation and you're eligible for these payments, the most important tool as a farmer is not what's in your machine shed. It's the lawyer you hire to set up a paper farm that's designed to absorb as much federal money, as much Trump payment, as possible.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: And there are lawyers who are documenting these family owners?\n\n\n\nKen Cook: There are lawyers who specialize in helping big farms maximize their payments from the Department of Agriculture. It's an industry in and of itself. And they do very well.\n\n\n\nLawyers like Robert Serio who for years have been making the most of the loopholes in farm subsidy policy - and now the Trump administration's bailout.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you know the nickname that you have?\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: Uh, not really.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: It's Loophole. They call you Loophole.\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: Somebody else called me the Cap Doctor.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh, the Cap Doctor?\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: The Cap Doctor.\n\nRobert Serio\n\nSerio is based here in Clarendon, Arkansas, a tiny town with one sit down restaurant where he knows everybody.\n\n\n\nHe has more than 250 clients in 25 states that he says are all actively engaged in farming. Serio represents the deline farming operations. They include three partnerships that usda data show are registered to the same address in Missouri, which in total collected more than $5 million in the bailout so far \u2013 way more than the cap.\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: These are not loopholes. They are designed regulations. All I did was follow a trail that the government laid out for me.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, no one is saying it's illegal. Nobody.\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: No.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: If that farm is a partnership, how much can they get if there are 20 people in the partnership? Do they still only get $250,000?\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: No, ma'am.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: They get $250,000 times 20, right?\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: If, if they earn it. If that land that they're farming earns that money.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's say it earned the money, but there's only one person. And he, they then get\u2026\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: I would say to that one person he needs to come and see me. Because he's not running a very economical farming operation.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: So I've come to you. What are you-- what do you do? What do you advise me to do?\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: First thing I would do, ask you if you were married. And if your answer is yes, I would say, \"Then you need to form a husband and wife partnership.\" That would be my first advice. Secondly, if you're even bigger than that, I might ask you, \"Do you have any children who are working' on the farm?\"\n\nAnd if that answer is yes, then I would tell them how to be able to use that child to enhance that-- the cash flow for that partnership I'm going to form. And your farming operation will be-- have more eligibility and en-- enhance your cash flow, make you more profitable. Everybody'll benefit from that.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: What's the largest partnership you ever formed?\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: 66 partners.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: 66.\n\n\n\nRobert Serio: Yeah.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: That's a lot.\n\nSonny Perdue\n\nRemember this is taxpayer money. Secretary Perdue said if farmers are exploiting weak subsidy laws to get money they shouldn't, it's Congress' fault.\n\n\n\nSonny Perdue: What I'm telling you, Lesley, is that we use the same criteria as Congress passed in the farm bill to determine who is eligible to receive money and who is not. That-- that's the facts.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: Ok.\n\n\n\nSonny Perdue: We-- we are administrators of the law passed by Congress.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: But let me ask you, as the secretary of agriculture, if you think that's a good idea. To have those-- allow those partnerships to exist.\n\n\n\nSonny Perdue: I think, again, it really is the responsibility to Congress to determine this. From my perspective as an administrator, my job is to follow the law.\n\nProduced by Sarah Koch. Associate producer, Chrissy Jones.

Oyez! Oyez!\u201d Talkin began, dropping the words commanding people \u201cto draw near\u201d to reflect the unusual circumstances.\n\nArguments, scheduled to last an hour as they would generally in the courtroom, ran 17 minutes long, but without serious problems. The justices asked roughly two questions apiece at a time, and Roberts occasionally interjected to keep things moving.\n\nAnd there was one mild surprise: Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions for the first time in more than a year.\n\nSeveral justices said \u201cgood morning\u201d to the lawyers, a telephone nicety not often heard in the courtroom. The justices also did not interrupt each other, as they frequently do in court, and instead took turns asking questions.\n\nThe court\u2019s plaza, normally bustling on the mornings of arguments, was deserted Monday, as it has been since the building was closed to the public in mid-March because of the virus outbreak. Two months of arguments were postponed before the court decided to hear 10 cases over six days in May.\n\nThe experiment could propel the court to routinely livestream its arguments. Or it could just be an extraordinary exception to the court\u2019s sustained opposition to broadening the audience that can hear, if not see, its work live.\n\nCases that will be heard over the next two weeks include President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to shield tax and other financial records and whether presidential electors have to cast their Electoral College ballots for the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state.\n\nThe court chose a somewhat obscure case about whether the travel website Booking.com can trademark its name for its first foray into remote arguments. The lawyers on both sides are well known to the justices and experienced in arguing before the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Erica Ross, who once served as a law clerk to Justice Elena Kagan, was first up. She last argued at the court in late February. She delivered this Supreme Court argument, her sixth, from a Justice Department conference room.\n\nShe was followed by Lisa Blatt, a onetime government lawyer who will be arguing her 40th Supreme Court case. Blatt will be at her Washington-area home, she told The Washington Post.\n\nShe is known for her colorful writing and speaking style and for her ability to engage in a healthy give and take with the justices. She was also a prominent liberal supporter of Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court.\n\nBlatt, representing Booking.com, got Justice Sonia Sotomayor to laugh out loud when she told the justice, \u201cIt looks like we would have lost if you were the trial judge.\u201d\n\nEach lawyer got two uninterrupted minutes to make an opening statement, after which Roberts kicked off the questioning. After that, the justices asked questions in order of seniority. Kavanaugh, who joined the court in 2018, went last.\n\nThe court sometimes issues opinions at the start of argument sessions, with the justice who wrote for the majority reading a summary of the opinion and, more rarely, a second justice summarizing a dissent. But in another change wrought by the virus outbreak, opinions are being posted online without any statements from justices. The court will next issue opinions on Thursday.\n\nThe session ended as it always does in the courtroom. Roberts said, \u201cThe case is submitted.\u201d\n\nTalkin followed: \u201cThe honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":591,"url":"https:\/\/www.pravdareport.com\/news\/world\/144539-china_usa_questions\/?utm_referrer=main_last_news_list","publisher":"Pravda Report","publish_date":"2020-05-04","author":[],"title":"Ten highly unpleasant questions that China wants to ask the USA","image":"https:\/\/cdn.pravda.ru\/eng\/image\/preview\/article\/\/5\/3\/9\/144539_soc.jpeg","body_text":"Ten highly unpleasant questions that China wants to ask the USA\n\nUS officials persistently accuse China of concealing the true extent of the outbreak of coronavirus disease to stock up on medical supplies. According to the USA, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that COVID-19 began to spread worldwide from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nSupposedly, Beijing did not inform the WHO of the degree of contagiousness of the infection and hid data on an increase in imports of medical goods (face masks, surgical gowns, gloves, etc) and a decrease in their exports.\n\nUS President Donald Trump says that the Chinese authorities made a huge mistake at the early stage of the fight against the spread of coronavirus and misled the international community in trying to hide the infection.\n\nChina believes USA is hiding the truth\n\nThe Chinese authorities reject all allegations claiming that China, from the very beginning of the epidemic, took an open and responsible position in informing the world community about the spread of the infection. The PRC also refers to numerous scientific confirmations and the WHO that say that the virus could not be created artificially.\n\nIn this regard, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, People's Daily, has formulated ten questions, which the world wants the United States to answer.\n\nAccording to the publication, it has been more than 100 days since the discovery of the first case of COVID-19 in the United States.

Stockdale\n\n24\/7 Wall Street\n\nSince the lockdown caused by concerns over the spread of coronavirus, people have been left to their own devices at home, and those include cell phones, laptops, iPads, video games and television remote controls, among others.\n\nBefore the pandemic, these devices were frequently used \u2013 they are sometimes called high-touch items \u2013 and now that so many of us are home, they are being handled even more often, and not necessarily by a single user. That raises the specter of spreading the dreaded coronavirus. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.\n\n24\/7 Tempo has compiled a list of cleaning tips for your phones, tablets and other devices. We reviewed articles in trade publications, as well as general media sources to create our list.\n\nThose using electronic devices need to clean the plastic and steel surfaces with the proper disinfectants. These are the kinds of surfaces where the coronavirus can survive for up to 72 hours. Most of the products used for cleaning might already be available in your home. The American Chemistry Council has a list of EPA-approved products. Soap and hot water is also a safe option that will help reduce the spread of the virus. Obviously, always use common sense when cleaning electronics: unplug them first, do not submerge them, and only use a small amount of cleaner on a cloth so that moisture doesn't enter any openings.\n\nCell phones\n\nThe two leading cell-phone makers updated their websites to inform customers how to clean those devices. Apple said on its website that iPhones can be safely cleaned with disinfectant wipes, including products such as Clorox sheets. Samsung said you can wipe down the device with a microfiber cloth containing an alcohol-based solution (70%). A National Institute of Infectious Disease study of mobile phones from 2017 found a median of more than 17,000 bacterial gene copies on each.\n\nTablets\n\nA tablet is a portable computer such as an iPad. You can use alcohol-based agents to clean your device and attention should be paid to the screen and buttons. Remove any case on the tablet and clean underneath. When you put the case back on, wipe down the outside of it.\n\nPhone chargers\n\nCleaning phone chargers to remove dirt and other impurities, as well as viruses, can be tricky. You can use a can of compressed air and spray the air in short bursts into the port. Otherwise, bring the charger to be cleaned by a professional.\n\nTouch screens\n\nComputer touch screens can be cleaned by using a small amount of warm, soapy water or a solution made to specifically clean touch screens. When cleaning, use a microfiber cloth to avoid scratching the screen. Mixing water and rubbing alcohol works, too but any mixture of more than 50% alcohol might damage the screen and remove the coating that protects it from fingerprints.\n\nKeyboards\n\nKeyboards have lots of germs and are potential virus havens. Researchers at the University of Arizona found that the average desktop has 400 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat. A New England Journal of Medicine study showed that the coronavirus was still detectable on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours, meaning viruses can live longer on non-porous surfaces such as keyboards. Keyboards should be unplugged and then shaken. Then they can be cleaned by gently wiping them down by using a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Stay away from bleach and don't let moisture into the openings.\n\nRemote controls\n\nNow that we're sheltering in place, we're watching a lot more television and using the remote control, which can potentially harbor the coronavirus. Among the cleaning agents that are effective for cleaning remote controls are Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. The American Chemistry Council has a list of products approved by the EPA.\n\nMouse\n\nLike many devices, your mouse can be cleaned using products such as Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. Before you start cleaning, unplug your mouse and remove batteries. Researchers have found that the virus can survive for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like the mouse.\n\nMonitors\n\nComputer monitors don't receive frequent contact from hands, but viruses can still settle on them so they should be cleaned periodically. Cleaning agents should not come into direct contact with the monitors and instead droplets of the agent should be applied to a microsoft fiber cloth, which can then be used to clean the monitor.\n\nPCs\n\nPersonal computers can harbor germs and viruses, and the risk rises as more people use the same device. A study published in the American Journal of Infection Control said bacteria and other potentially hazardous microbes can be present on shared computer terminals and may be transmitted to users. Before cleaning a PC, unplug the device. PCs can be cleaned by using a lint-free cloth made from microfiber. Don't use aerosol sprays or abrasive cleaning agents and don't spray cleaners directly on the computer. Make sure no moisture enters any openings.\n\nLaptops\n\nOften receiving daily use, laptops can be major carriers of germs, thereby potentially spreading bacteria and disease. A 2018 New York Times article recommended laptop users begin by turning the machine off and removing the battery, if easily done, then cleaning out all of the crevices using canned air. The outside can then be wiped down using a microfiber cloth with a few drops of rubbing alcohol added to it \u2013 never apply alcohol directly to the computer. The screen can be wiped using a microfiber cloth dampened with plain water.\n\nNebulizers\n\nNebulizers are machines that spray medicine as a fine mist via a mouthpiece or mask, and are often used to treat asthma and other lung diseases. As nebulizers generate particles that can carry bacteria and viruses deep into one's lungs, some medical agencies, such as Canada's Alberta Health Services, have recommended their use be avoided during the pandemic. They can be cleaned by rinsing the cup with warm water and allowing it to air dry after each use and washing with warm, soapy water at the end of each day. They should be disinfected at least once per week.\n\nWatches\n\nThe coronavirus can linger on the glass surface of watches. To eradicate the virus, use products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap to disinfect the surface. Clorox wipes can be used to sterilize Apple Watches, though the company cautions customers not to use the agent on fabric or leather bands and not to use bleach. Infectious disease researchers recommend cleaning wearables such as Fitbit devices frequently.\n\nHeadphones\n\nHeadphones can collect debris and oil from one's skin, and generally pick up germs throughout the day. Due to their electronic nature, cleaning them can be tricky. One can use a towel with warm water mixed with a drop or two of a mild detergent. A small amount of alcohol may also be used, though depending on the type of headphones being cleaned, alcohol can have damaging effects. If it is used, it should be dried off carefully when done.\n\nE-readers\n\nThe supply chain for e-reader companies \u2013 including Amazon and Sony \u2013 was thrown into disarray in January as the virulence of the coronavirus became known. Researchers have discovered that the virus can live for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like e-readers. E-readers should be cleaned with products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap and hot water to expunge the virus.\n\nPrinters\n\nPrinters have become ubiquitous in American homes along with laptops and personal computers and as such can also host the coronavirus. Owners of printers are advised to turn them off before cleaning. They should wear protective disposable rubber or nitrile gloves during cleaning. Areas of the printer that can come in contact with humans \u2013 control or cover panels, for example \u2013 need to be cleaned with a solution of 70%-plus isopropyl alcohol, although 99.9% isopropyl alcohol is recommended. Don't spray the solution directly on the device \u2013 put it on a lint-free rag or cloth. Use a glass cleaner for the copying surface. Before powering up, make sure all surfaces are dry.\n\nGame consoles\n\nWhether you are an XBox One or Playstation aficionado, you need to clean the consoles for these game systems. Game consoles qualify as so-called high-touch areas. Though the coronavirus is spread through droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing, particles can last for up to three days on plastic and steel. They can be cleaned by wiping them down with a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Rubbing alcohol can also be used if Clorox or Lysol wipes are in short supply.\n\nCameras\n\nWith so many people in lockdown, those sheltering in place are recording these extraordinary times in photographs. Shutterbugs need to be aware that bringing a camera to your face also exposes you to germs and viruses. Enthusiasts should wipe down the camera with a soft, dry cloth that contains denatured alcohol.\n\nFans\n\nWhether or not the new coronavirus is airborne is still up for debate. However, fans \u2013 including ceiling fans, window fans, and those on stands \u2013 have the potential to spread aerosolized human pathogens. Those in the vicinity of fans can remove dust from the blades using a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner with attachment. It's also recommended that those most at risk of the dangers of COVID-19 wear a face mask when fans are in use.\n\nATM machines\n\nATMs can be exceptionally dirty because of the many fingers touching their screens and keypads, as well as the presence of dollar bills, which are notoriously unclean. Following stay-at-home orders, many banks \u2013 including JPMorgan Chase and PNC \u2013 closed branches, requiring customers to rely on the machines. According to COVID-19 safety guidelines from the National ATM Council, users should wear disposable gloves or use hand sanitizer for any contact with ATM terminals and cash. They should also follow CDC guidelines, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding touching one's face, and maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people.\n\n24\/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Trump bars pandemic task-force members from talking to Congress. US is facing a new, more dangerous coronavirus mutation. How much will we pay for a vaccine? We need a national plan, not local plans. The 1918-19 flu caused a surge of right-wing extremism. The Big 3.\n\nKey forecasts for coronavirus deaths are rising as states reopen. Meanwhile, a White House forecaster thinks people are just going to stop dying.\n\nCoronavirus-related deaths in the United States are nearing 70,000.\n\nOn Monday, as Insider's Sinead Baker reports, researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington nearly doubled their US death forecast to 134,000 by early August, with more deaths expected thereafter.\n\nThe IHME increased the death forecast because the epidemic peak in the US is lasting longer than expected and new cases are declining more slowly than expected.\n\nAs Insider's Eliza Relman reported on Monday, another forecasting model, featured in a government \"situation update,\" assumes a radical acceleration in daily new cases and deaths by the end of this month.\n\nUS Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times\n\nThis latter forecast was apparently preliminary, and the White House and CDC have since disavowed it. But the researcher from Johns Hopkins who put it together told The Washington Post that \"there are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the White House's own model is decidedly more optimistic.\n\nThe Post reports that economist and Trump adviser Kevin Hassett has developed a model that predicts coronavirus deaths will drop sharply this month and \"essentially go to zero\" by May 15. Here's his \"cubic fit\" model overlaid with the other models.\n\nNo one knows the future. Everyone is free to come up with their own forecasts. But some forecasts have more logic supporting them than others.\n\nAnd the White House's, meanwhile, seems more like a dream. \u2014 HB\n\nThe White House has barred 'Coronavirus Task Force' experts from speaking to Congress\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and President Donald Trump during a briefing on the coronavirus at the National Institutes of Health, March 3, 2020, in Bethesda, Maryland. AP\n\nThe Trump administration this week squashed two efforts to start a broader conversation about its coronavirus response.\n\nThe White House barred the members of its pandemic task force from testifying to Congress, effectively preventing the legislative branch from asking any questions of the executive branch about the most significant global catastrophe since World War II. The White House claims it wants to keep task-force members from being distracted.\n\nOn the same day, the administration skipped a global vaccine summit designed to raise billions for research, rally public support, and start the conversation about how to collaborate globally on manufacturing and distribution.\n\nWhat did the administration not skip? Self-promotion. It arranged for a friendly Fox News interview of the president inside the Lincoln Memorial, an unprecedented use of that sacred civic space.\n\nThis is a demoralizing trend: The Trump administration enthusiastically seeks any opportunity for self-promotion and aggrandizement of its COVID-19 response, any occasion when it can claim success.\n\nBut the coronavirus crisis is not a problem solved by mere claims, by the rhetorical energy the president specializes in. Solving it requires constant effort, improvement, revision, cooperation, clarity, and transparency. If the administration refuses to answer hard questions, listen to Congress, or even collaborate with allies, we'll continue to lag the world in stopping the pandemic. \u2014DP\n\nA study shows coronavirus may have mutated\n\nAn early draft of a study from researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory \u2014 which has not been published or peer-reviewed yet \u2014 suggests that the coronavirus mutated over the past few months. They concluded that the strain of the virus that has afflicted most people in the US is the newer version.\n\nThe researchers have not yet figured out whether one strain is significantly different or more harmful than another. If a virus mutates enough, it could have implications for treatments and vaccines, but researchers so far think the new coronavirus mutates at a very slow rate, which is promising.\n\nIn previous epidemics, such as the devastating \"Great Influenza\" of 1918-19, a second strain of the virus \u2014 the one that wiped out most of the estimated 39 million people who died \u2014 was more deadly than the first.\n\nThe challenge for vaccines, meanwhile, is that if a virus mutates a vaccine that works for one strain might not work for another.\n\nThe researchers' draft study itself is here, but it's dense. \u2014HB\n\nHow much will a COVID-19 vaccine cost? Way way way way less than it's worth\n\nA laboratory technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at \"Fire Eye\" laboratory in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. Getty\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine trials are starting at an encouraging clip. Insider's Andrew Dunn reports on a new Pfizer one today.\n\nBut the high stakes and enormous costs of accelerating research have raised fears that a COVID-19 vaccine will be too expensive, and that whatever company makes it will score windfall profits.\n\nSince there's not yet a vaccine, it's too early to answer the pricing and profit questions. But surveys I've seen, including this Insider story, suggest a possible cost of about $10 per dose when manufacturing gets scaled up. Here are a few key things to remember about that vaccine, when it does arrive:\n\nIt will need to be made available worldwide. There will be monumental pressure on the manufacturer and the nation that made it to license it globally. And if they don't license it, it will be pirated. It's too valuable for any country to go without it.\n\nIt will get cheaper as we learn how to make and distribute it better.\n\nThe company that makes it will earn billions in profits, even if their original research was funded by a government.\n\nMost important, however much the vaccine costs, however huge the windfall profits to the manufacturer, it will be worth it.\n\nConservative estimates suggest COVID-19 will slash $3 trillion from global economic output in 2020. That's $375 per person this year alone. It will inflict trillions and trillions more damage in years to come.\n\nIf a vaccine ended up costing $100 per dose (and it definitely won't be that pricey), and we spent $780 billion to vaccinate everyone on earth, it would still be the bargain of the century. \u2014DP\n\nWe need national leadership and a national plan\n\nMany states in the US are beginning to reopen. Their eagerness is understandable: The pandemic and lockdowns are having a devastating effect on our economy, jobs, and lives, and we're desperate to get back to normal. And with warmer weather outside, and declining cases in some areas, patience is nearing its end.\n\nThe problem is that this initial phase of our national coronavirus-attack plan \u2014 mitigation \u2014 did not go as well as planned.\n\nNationwide, new cases and deaths per day have flattened (good), but they have not yet meaningfully declined (bad). Excluding the tristate area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in fact, US cases per day are continuing to rise.\n\nTwo caveats to this. First, the economist Ian Shepardson points out that most of the increase outside of the tristate area is coming from only seven states. A trailing average of cases in 40 of 50 US states, he says, are now declining.\n\nSecond, the steady (and important) increase in US testing capacity may account for some of this increase in confirmed cases. But it probably doesn't account for all of it.\n\nMost important, we still don't have a plan for the next phase or a leader to bring us together and lead us through it.\n\nState and local governments do have a critical role to play. Each county, state, and region is facing a different situation, and each needs to approach their situation differently.\n\nBut US states and cities are not separate countries. US citizens \u2014 at least in normal times \u2014 travel freely from one state and city to another. Even if each state and city were capable of eliminating the virus on its own, traveling Americans would continually bring the virus with them.\n\nIf we want to get back to normal, therefore, we need a national approach, not just a state and local approach. The federal government can't just be a \"backup,\" as the Trump administration has recently been saying.\n\nThe federal government needs to lead. And the federal government needs a plan.\n\nWhat do we need in this federal plan?\n\nMostly, funding. Funding for the states. Funding for testing. Funding for contact tracing. Funding for isolation and quarantine facilities.\n\nBut also leadership.\n\nWe need our federal government to use its resources and expertise to develop, communicate, coordinate, and execute a national and then global plan. We need regular updates from relevant experts on how the plan is going and how we're changing it as the circumstances change.\n\nThat's what our federal government is there for, after all. That's what we built it and pay it to do.\n\nAnd yet, even as the country opens back up, it is clear that our federal government has no real plan. Instead, our federal government appears to be leaving the problem to someone else. \u2014HB\n\nWill COVID-19 lead to a rise in political extremism?\n\nGerman cities with higher mortality from the 1918-19 flu voted more heavily for the Nazis in 1932-33, a New York Federal Reserve researcher concludes in a new paper.\n\nEven after controlling for other factors including income, religion, and ethnic makeup, flu deaths corresponded to a rise in right-wing extremism 14 years later. (Though not to a rise in left-wing extremism. Voting for the communist party was unaffected.)\n\nWill COVID-19 cause a similar extremist surge in hard-hit countries? \u2014DP\n\nThe Big 3*\n\nRoyal baby Archie Harrison turns 1.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor during their royal tour of South Africa on September 25, 2019.

You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5\/01\/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5\/14\/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201ctesting and contact tracers\u201d to be sent directly to everyone\u2019s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201cfor other purposes,\u201d such as \u201csupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201d\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201cnational COVID health emergency.\u201d Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u2019ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and\/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201cfaith-based\u201d and \u201cschool-based\u201d institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201cconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201d require no viral testing, and only \u201csuspicion of infection.\u201d This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201cpublic health safety,\u201d into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201cwar on terror,\u201d but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201cNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201d Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"","reliability":0},{"news_id":614,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/5\/5\/21248366\/trump-pick-to-oversee-rescue-spending-pledges-impartiality","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-05","author":[],"title":"Trump pick to oversee rescue spending pledges impartiality","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/cn1NKsI8XBk-Fs1DDTW3uXJDt9Q=\/0x221:3000x1792\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19946792\/143046692.jpg.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s choice to oversee a significant chunk of the $2 trillion economic rescue law is pledging to conduct audits and investigations \u201cwith fairness and impartiality.\u2019\u2019\n\nBrian Miller, a lawyer in the White House counsel\u2019s office, goes before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday for his nomination as special inspector general for pandemic recovery.

Workers at the facility, called JFK8, have been calling for greater safety precautions since early March. While Amazon has made changes, the number of workers diagnosed with the virus continues to climb. According to alerts viewed by The Verge, at least 29 workers have fallen ill.\n\nManagers notified several workers at JFK8 of the death yesterday. Amazon says the employee was last on site on April 5th and was placed on quarantine after he was confirmed to have COVID-19 on April 11th. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the loss of an associate at our site in Staten Island, NY,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said. \u201cHis family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting his fellow colleagues.\u201d\n\nJFK8 was the first of several Amazon facilities to have workers walk out in protest of the company\u2019s handling of COVID-19, in late March. Following that walkout, Amazon made a series of changes to warehouse processes, including mandating social distancing and screening workers for fevers. In its quarterly earnings release last week, the company said it planned to spend $4 billion \u2014 equivalent to its expected operating profit \u2014 on its COVID-19 response. But workers say the safety precautions are still insufficient and that their jobs often require them being in close proximity.\n\nAt least 29 workers at the facility have fallen ill\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t released statistics on how many facilities have had COVID-19 cases or how many workers have fallen ill, but estimates tallied by workers from alerts they receive put the number of facilities at over 130 \u2014 some, like JFK8, with dozens of cases. (An Amazon spokesperson says the rate of infection at JFK8 is below that of the surrounding community and that the company believes the cases at the warehouses are not connected.) The first known death of an Amazon warehouse worker occurred on March 31st, an operations manager at Amazon\u2019s Hawthorne, California facility. An employee at an Amazon warehouse in Tracy, California, died on April 1st. So far, Amazon has closed only one facility in the US, a returns-processing center in Kentucky, and only after it was ordered to do so by the governor. Amazon warehouses in France have been shut since April 16th, after a French court ruled that deliveries should be limited to necessities such as groceries and medical supplies.\n\nAmazon has been on a hiring spree as it attempts to meet surging demand during the pandemic. It has hired 175,000 workers in recent weeks, and this month, it ended a policy begun early in the crisis allowing workers to take unlimited time off without pay. Since the policy ended, workers at JFK8 say conditions have been even more crowded than usual.\n\nAmazon fired the organizer of the first JFK8 walkout\n\nAmazon has also responded aggressively to worker protests. It fired the organizer of the first JFK8 walkout, Christian Smalls, and a memo obtained by Vice revealed plans to smear him. The New York Attorney General\u2019s office said in a letter obtained by NPR that safety precautions at the warehouse were \u201cinadequate\u201d and the company may have violated the state\u2019s whistleblower protection laws. Amazon also fired workers who raised safety concerns in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and a second worker at JFK8. Last month, the company fired two user experience designers after their group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, organized an event to hear from warehouse workers.\n\nIn the latest sign that unrest over warehouse conditions is spreading through the company\u2019s white-collar workforce, Amazon senior engineer and vice president Tim Bray resigned over the firings of whistleblowers, saying that \u201cremaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":618,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/politics\/2020\/5\/5\/21248300\/vote-by-mail-debate-election-disinformation-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-trump-2020","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-05","author":[],"title":"Vote-by-mail debate raises fears of election disinformation","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/4rWEo5E6RNHWHJ8c3zHE5pSjAFg=\/0x0:5959x3120\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19946670\/1211232919.jpg.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A bitterly partisan debate unfolding on whether more Americans should cast their votes through the mail during a pandemic is provoking online disinformation and conspiracy theories that could undermine trust in the results, even if there are no major problems.\n\nWith social distancing guidelines possibly curtailing in-person voting at the polls in November, states are drawing up plans to rely more heavily on a mail-in system that has until now seen only limited use.\n\nGet the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.\n\nHistorically, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting. But social media users are already pushing grandiose theories casting doubt on the method. President Donald Trump has encouraged the skepticism, saying during a televised briefing that \u201ca lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.\u201d On Saturday, he tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t allow RIGGED ELECTIONS!\u201d\n\nJustice Department officials are concerned foreign adversaries could exploit any vulnerabilities in the vote-by-mail process, especially since even minor tampering could trigger widespread doubts about the integrity of the vote.\n\n\u201cIs it possible, in particular for a foreign actor, to cause enough mischief in the vote-by-mail process to raise a question in the minds of Americans, particularly Americans perhaps whose candidate has lost, that somehow the result of this election is unfair?\u201d Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department\u2019s top national security official, said in describing a key question confronting law enforcement.\n\nSeveral disinformation experts said they have not found evidence yet that foreign actors are covertly pushing a false narrative about mail-in voting.\n\nBut a sham social media campaign that feeds existing doubts about the U.S. election process would align with the Kremlin\u2019s playbook, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington think tank. During the 2016 election, Russia-linked groups polluted American voters\u2019 social media feeds with messages about hot-button topics like race relations, gun laws and immigration.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hack the vote to hack people\u2019s perception of the vulnerability of the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you need to do is to seed enough doubt about the legitimacy of a vote.\u201d\n\nWell before the coronavirus upended America\u2019s electoral process, federal officials were girding for the prospect of foreign interference in the U.S. election. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned in February that Russia could seek to misuse voter registration data and even secretly advise campaigns or candidates, according to documents The Associated Press obtained.\n\nNow, a potential overhaul of how millions of Americans vote could present new vulnerabilities for foreign adversaries to weaponize.\n\nOnly five states currently conduct mail-in voting, where a ballot is automatically mailed to every eligible voter.\n\nThe remaining states have substantial work in the months ahead. They will have to make major changes to their voting and tabulating systems, buy equipment or software to track the ballots and sort out who \u2014 individual voters or taxpayers \u2014 will pay for return postage in less than six months\u2019 time to accommodate more voting by mail.\n\nSome states are exploring how to simply expand existing absentee voting systems, in which voters can request a ballot.\n\n\u201cJust like you wouldn\u2019t want to premiere your play straight to Broadway, it\u2019s hard to have a very new or very changed system in a high-stakes presidential election, especially under conditions where normal meetings, trainings, might be impacted by the pandemic,\u201d said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nThose last-minute changes could spur unsubstantiated claims about rampant voter fraud, an unsupported theory that Trump and some of his supporters have already pushed for years.\n\nRussian state media have already questioned states\u2019 attempts to postpone primaries or transition them to a mail-in process as governors grapple with how to hold an election against the backdrop of the virus.\n\n\u201cCoronavirus is coming, hide the ballots! Calls to cancel campaigns & voting erode already-thin trust in US primaries,\u201d read a headline on the website of the Russian television channel RT, which broadcasts in English and is aimed at audiences outside Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, conspiracy theories that Democrats are hyping the pandemic to push for mail-in voting or that forecasts of a second wave this fall are part of a ploy to cancel an in-person vote have received thousands of likes, retweets and shares on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. The theories are popular in dozens of Facebook groups that have been created in recent weeks to protest governors\u2019 stay-at-home orders.\n\n\u201cWhen you have this ambiguity and uncertainty, that\u2019s fertile ground for pushing out false information,\u201d said Schafer, the think tank fellow. \u201cThis is creating a perfect environment for these narratives to thrive.\u201d\n\nNegative chatter around mail-in ballots spiked in those Facebook groups after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed expanding early voting and mail-in voting last month, said Madelyn Webb, a research reporter for First Draft, an organization that tracks disinformation.\n\nOne popular meme accused Democrats of extending the quarantine to push \u201cmail in ballots so they can cheat.\u201d The image received a combined 90,000 likes, comments and shares, mostly on pro-Trump and conservative Facebook pages.\n\nAnd for under $100, the Alaska Republican Party took out a Facebook ad that said: \u201cDemocrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to gut election fraud protections.

While some major space companies are still in operation, considered essential by the US government, smaller startups are grappling with how to move forward as once-reliable funding sources evaporate.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the global space industry was really coming into its stride, valued at around $360 billion, according to one analysis. In the US, an eclectic mix of major players and smaller startups comprise this sector, pursuing established markets like building rockets and satellites as well as more niche services like creating space habitats, mining the Moon, and manufacturing in space. For the last few years, space startups with bold ideas could successfully close round after round of funding.\n\n\u201cventure capital firms are pausing on their new investments.\u201d\n\nNow, companies may have a hard time getting infusions from outside investors. \u201cNormally, you have capital to help [companies] continue to grow,\u201d Carissa Christensen, founder and CEO of Bryce Space and Technology, a space analytics and engineering firm, tells The Verge. \u201cYou assume that they would be able to find other investors as well, and then you\u2019d be looking for a new deal. Now, in this environment, where it\u2019s unclear how companies are going to be affected by the situation, venture capital firms are pausing on their new investments, and preserving their capital.\u201d\n\nThat means companies will likely rely on government contracts \u2014 either from NASA or the Department of Defense \u2014 now more than ever as a guaranteed source of funding. \u201cA lot of these companies have the government as part of their revenue stream \u2014some of it, the majority of their revenue stream,\u201d Chad Anderson, CEO of angel investment and venture capital firm Space Angels, tells The Verge. \u201cMost space companies have some government money coming in, and the government money is not drying up.\u201d\n\nA few high-profile space companies succumbed at the start of the pandemic. Bigelow Aerospace, which aims to build habitats and hotels in space, laid off all of its employees in late March, blaming orders from the governor of Nevada to close all nonessential businesses. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t [close], we would be subject to fines, penalties, and the threat of having our business license revoked,\u201d a spokesperson for Bigelow told The Verge at the time. Internet-from-space provider OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in late March, just after launching its latest batch of internet-providing satellites.\n\nAnalysts say these early losses are likely the result of problems that companies had before the pandemic, and the economic downturn just amplified those issues. \u201cThere were underlying problems before the virus,\u201d Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, tells The Verge. \u201cWith OneWeb, it wasn\u2019t corona that took them out. It was the fact that they needed to find $500 million more. It may have been that the virus exacerbated that a little bit or accelerated it.\u201d Bigelow had been vying for government contracts from NASA, but the company had mostly been self-funded. OneWeb also turned to the UK government after an expected investment from its backer SoftBank fell through.\n\n\u201cThe companies that are highly capital intensive are going to struggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe companies that are highly capital intensive are going to struggle, because capital is scarce right now,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThe companies that are profitable, or have found novel, low-cost ways to do things in new ways \u2014 or if they\u2019re focused on minimizing costs and focusing on the business model \u2014 those companies are going to fare better.\u201d\n\nSome aerospace startups are still figuring out where to focus their attention in this new reality. California-based Rocket Lab put its launches on pause in New Zealand to keep its personnel safe. Relativity Space, which is making a completely 3D-printed rocket, says it is doing well during the pandemic but that there will be a delay in testing its hardware. One startup launch provider, Astra, laid off a couple dozen employees to help survive the pandemic, according to a report from CNBC.\n\nMany smaller space companies are looking for ways to get financial assistance from the government, as they run on tight margins. Some are less than a few years old and employ only 100 or so people, according to Stallmer. But unlike other small businesses, they don\u2019t qualify for government assistance. Many of the venture-backed space startups are disqualified from receiving funds through the CARES Act, which is set up to help small businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. There is a stipulation in the law that associates any venture-backed company with the venture capital firm they receive funds from, pushing many of these small firms over the 500-employee limit to get loans through CARES. The CSF wrote a joint letter with other organizations to the Department of the Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Small Business Administration urging them to change this affiliation rule.\n\nThe government is providing a different kind of lifeline to some of the major launch providers and satellite firms. Armed with government contracts, these companies are considered \u201cessential businesses,\u201d allowing them to operate more or less like normal. Launch providers like ULA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin hold multiple contracts with NASA and the Defense Department, allowing them to continue work to maintain their launch capabilities. This \u201cessential\u201d status has been extended to numerous aerospace companies working on government missions. \u201cAbout 50 percent of our portfolio has been deemed critical infrastructure or an essential service,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cSo they have some level of operations that are continuing.\u201d\n\nMany companies longed to have the government as a customer well before there was a pandemic. The government often has bigger pockets than venture capitalists, and early investments from the public sector can be critical for fledgling space companies. SpaceX, for instance, received early government contracts during its first decade of operation that helped the company survive and then thrive, according to a report from Space Angels.\n\n\u201cI would say that existing government programs, contracts, and activities should be relatively stable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say that existing government programs, contracts, and activities should be relatively stable,\u201d says Christensen. \u201cEven with the expense of responding to the pandemic, I think there\u2019s going to be some real caution about the economic consequences of abruptly ending government programs.\u201d\n\nThe government is still awarding contracts. Last week, NASA awarded three companies \u2014 SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Dynetics \u2014 contracts to develop landers to take humans to the Moon. Those contracts will last for 10 months, until February 2021, when NASA selects which companies it wants to actually build and do demonstrations with the landers. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s able to jump in and help with that liquidity gap right now is it a lifeline,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd so the government is acting as that.\u201d\n\nDespite having the government as a customer, more established companies aren\u2019t immune from the effects of the pandemic. \u201cHypothetically, if their suppliers for their fuel valves or fuel pumps go under because they can\u2019t get enough orders, then that\u2019s gonna have a ripple effect on them,\u201d says Stallmer, potentially making it harder for companies to continue operating and manufacturing on schedule and at the same prices they\u2019re used to.\n\nIn the meantime, some space companies are keeping busy by pitching in with the pandemic response. Companies like Planet, Maxar, and more have been providing crucial Earth imaging with their satellites to establish global trends and how the pandemic is affecting people\u2019s movement around the world. Other satellites are being used to provide much need communications and connectivity options, helping doctors perform telehealth visits in rural areas.\n\nWhether they\u2019re keeping busy or just trying to keep the lights on, companies across the industry are all stuck in the same pandemic-induced holding pattern. Like many industries, it\u2019s still too early to say what will happen in the future. But for smaller companies with loftier ambitions, the financial picture has already shifted. To make it through, they\u2019ll have to tighten their belts and adjust their plans or scramble for a government-funded lifeline that keeps their unique space goals alive.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":632,"url":"https:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/2020\/05\/06\/in-tearful-post-frontline-nurse-explains-how-covid-19-patients-are-being-murdered-in-nyc-hospitals\/","publisher":"Waking Times","publish_date":"2020-05-06","author":"['Vic Bishop']","title":"In Tearful Post, Frontline Nurse Explains How Covid-19 Patients are Being \u2018Murdered\u2019 in NYC Hospitals","image":"https:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NYC-nurse-on-Covid.jpg","body_text":"Sen.

The first of two cases before them Wednesday stemmed from the Obama-era health law, under which most employers must cover birth control as a preventive service, at no charge to women, in their insurance plans.\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration announced it would broaden an exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement that previously applied to houses of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. But the change was blocked by courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s four liberal justices suggested they were troubled by the changes, which the government has estimated would cause about 70,000 women, and at most 126,000 women, to lose contraception coverage in one year.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, a key vote on a court split between conservatives and liberals, suggested that the Trump administration\u2019s reliance on a federal religious freedom law to expand the exemption was \u201ctoo broad.\u201d\n\nAnd Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the conversation from a Maryland hospital where she was being treated for an infection caused by a gallstone, gave the government\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Franciso, what sounded like a lecture.\n\n\u201cYou have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these .... services with no hassle, no cost to them,\u201d said Ginsburg, who is expected to be in the hospital for a day or two.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative justices seemed more willing to side with the administration, with Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting the administration\u2019s changes might be considered \u201cwithin the bounds of reasonable.\u201d\n\nBeyond exempting churches, synagogues and mosques from the contraceptive coverage requirement, the Obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs.\n\nThat opt-out process was the subject of a previous Supreme Court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, didn\u2019t decide the issue. It instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. \u201cIs it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences?\u201d Roberts asked at one point.\n\nAfter the Trump administration took over, officials announced a rule change that allows many companies and organization with religious or moral objections to opt out of covering birth control without providing an alternate avenue for coverage.\n\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged the rules in court, and a judge blocked them from going into effect. The judge found the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures for issuing the rules. An appeals court agreed, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court to step in, as did the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns had been instrumental in challenging the Obama administration rules.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned why the Little Sisters of the Poor were even at the court because for a number of reasons they don\u2019t have to provide contraceptive coverage. Sotomayor also referenced the coronavirus pandemic during her questioning, asking attorney Paul Clement, who was representing the nuns, whether an employer might be able to object to paying for a coronavirus vaccine. He said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nEven though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most people who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.\n\nIn the second case the justices heard Wednesday, political consultants and pollsters were among those asking the Supreme Court to strike down a federal law from 1991 that bars them from making robocalls to cellphones. The case only arose after Congress in 2015 created an exception in the law that allows the automated calls for collection of government debt.\n\nThe court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. \u201cNo one wants robocalls on their cellphone,\u201d Roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.\n\nThe argument provided a light moment of the day when Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him. Breyer said after he rejoined the court\u2019s arguments: \u201cThe telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call and I don\u2019t think it was a robocall.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":641,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/6\/21249479\/covid-19-masks-coronavirus-john-blumenthal-pandemic-swine-flu","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-06","author":[],"title":"Hey, I get it.

I just didn\u2019t think it was going to happen that quickly.\u201d\nNow two months have gone by, and almost everyone associated with the production \u2014 about 150 people \u2014 is out of work: actors and musicians, obviously, but also bartenders and box office workers, carpenters and choreographers, designers and dressers, programmers and propmasters.

And, by the way, I fully endorse it. But, literally, our income went to zero.\u201d\nBroadway, of course, is a summit for theatermakers, a symbol of New York and a big business that, until now, had been enjoying an extended boom. Last year was the best attended on record, with 14.6 million patrons; Broadway shows collectively grossed $1.8 billion.\nThe shutdown brought an abrupt end to that prolonged party. And among the 39 plays and musicals halted were 16 that never even made it to opening night, \u201cDoubtfire\u201d included.\n\u201cDoubtfire\u201d was a big bet, aimed squarely at the sweet spot of the Broadway audience: a $17 million musical, adapted from a hit movie, that aspired to be funny, poignant and family-friendly.\nNow the \u201cDoubtfire\u201d family has scattered across the country \u2014 some as close as Times Square, some as far as London \u2014 trying to stay safe and sane. They, like the rest of their theater world colleagues, have no idea when New York will settle in to some new normal, no idea when Broadway will attempt a comeback. They are worried, but also hopeful \u2014 a microcosm of an industry that is distressed but determined.\n\u2018We\u2019re doing the right thing.\u2019\u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d is a story about family. One family, really: The Hillards \u2014 Daniel, Miranda and their three children. The parents split up, and the father (memorably portrayed in the 1993 film by Robin Williams) is so determined to spend time with his children that he pretends to be a woman to land a job as the housekeeper.\nHilarity ensues. Trouble looms. Lessons are learned.After a five-week pre-Broadway run at Seattle\u2019s 5th Avenue Theater, the stage adaptation headed for Broadway facing headwinds \u2014 reviews in Seattle were mixed, shifting gender politics had made men in dresses an unreliable laugh line, and a stage adaptation of \u201cTootsie\u201d had just flopped. Plus, every Broadway show is enormously risky, because most of them fail.\nBut the producers, led by the Broadway veteran Kevin McCollum (\u201cRent,\u201d \u201cAvenue Q\u201d), were feeling confident as they sped toward an April 5 opening night. The audiences in Seattle seemed to like the show. And the lead actor, Rob McClure, who scored a Tony nomination for playing the title role in \u201cChaplin,\u201d starred in \u201cHoneymoon in Vegas,\u201d and was featured most recently in \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d was nailing his bifurcated performance.\nThen, McClure said, \u201cThe universe hit pause.\u201dOn that final day, the cast had gathered for an afternoon rehearsal knowing that, at any time, Broadway might shut down. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget checking my phone during our Wednesday evening performance and seeing that the N.B.A. had suspended the season, and knowing what was coming,\u201d said Brad Oscar, a two-time Tony nominee for \u201cSomething Rotten!\u201d and \u201cThe Producers.\u201d\nJenn Gambatese, the actress starring as Miranda (a role played on film by Sally Field), was center stage, rehearsing new blocking for her big solo number, when a stage manager told the company to brace for a closing announcement. She kept going for another 90 minutes.\n\u201cI felt calmer than I had in a while, and felt like I could focus better,\u201d said Gambatese, who had been so unnerved by the drumbeat of virus news that she brought a suitcase to work in case her commuter rail line was shut down and she got stuck in Midtown. \u201cEvery day was getting scarier and scarier,\u201d she said.\nMidafternoon, McCollum and the show\u2019s director, Jerry Zaks, assembled the company and told everyone to grab their stuff and go home.\nAnd just like that, it was over. The costumes were stored in dressing rooms. The souvenir tote bags and tumblers were locked in a cabinet. The ghost light \u2014 a bare bulb placed onstage when a theater is empty \u2014 was illuminated.\nMany expected they\u2019d be back in four weeks \u2014 the initial projected length of the shutdown. \u201cI remember placing my pencil down on my script and thinking to myself, \u2018It\u2019s so weird \u2014 that pencil is going to be in exactly the same place when we come back in a month,\u2019\u201d said Philip S.

KJ Hippensteel, a member of the ensemble, fled to his father-in-law\u2019s house in Cleveland with his wife and their two sons.\n\u201cBoth of us lost our jobs, for now, and we had no reason to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, we panicked and had to take action to feel like we were in control. In hindsight I think we were super lucky to have gotten out when we did.\u201d\nAmong those who stayed: Peter Bartlett, a comedic character actor and the oldest member of the cast, who plays a television host named Mr. Jolly. \u201cAt 77, this is the true passages of terror,\u201d he said.\nMost of the time, Bartlett has been holed up in his one-bedroom apartment in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, sustained by savings, Social Security and union pensions, talking to friends, reading, cleaning his kitchen and washing his hands. \u201cDid I ever think I\u2019d watch a dog rescue on YouTube? Now I\u2019ve watched hundreds of them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything to distract myself.\u201d\nOthers are finding their own distractions, like making ice cream, or practicing yoga. \u201cDestruction leaves a lot of creative space to occupy,\u201d said Akilah Ayanna, an ensemble member who is working on an album.\nSo Alexandra Matteo, a company member who understudies several parts, is podcasting. Tommy Kurzman, the makeup and prosthetics designer, adopted a dog. Paul Woodiel, the concertmaster, is singing cowboy songs with his wife (they are both violinists).\n\u201cWe have nice harmonies going on \u2018Keep on the Sunny Side,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cif only I could get through the lyrics without choking up.\u201d\n\u2018It has upended our lives.\u2019Broadway is a coveted corner of the theater world for many reasons \u2014 prestige, large audiences, enormous talent. But it\u2019s important for a much more materialistic reason: in a low-paying, high unemployment field, it\u2019s a place where theater artists can earn a good salary. The base pay for actors on Broadway is about $2,200 a week.\nBut the shutdown has thrown thousands out of work. Most union members got a few weeks\u2019 pay after the closing, but that has long since ended. And the usual fallbacks when stage shows are scarce \u2014 television, film, even waiting tables \u2014 are unavailable during this phase of the pandemic.\n\u201cPretty much everyone I know is planning on not paying their rent, because how are we expected to do that?\u201d said Cameron Rasmussen, one of the show\u2019s three guitarists.\nSeveral members of the company are married to others in the industry, meaning they are now facing a double income loss. Michael Rico Cohen, a stage manager, is married to a freelance television producer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite a few months before either of us sees a real paycheck again,\u201d he said. And Colleen Dietz, the show\u2019s music copyist (preparing the score for individual musicians), is married to Zachary Dietz, the music director. \u201cI know we will come back from this, but it will be a long, hard road for New York and for our family,\u201d she said.\nAmong the more complex predicaments is that facing the family of 9-year-old Lily Tamburo, who was cast as the understudy for Natalie, one of the three Hillard children. Lily lives in the Setaukets, on Long Island, with her mother and three older siblings; when the late-night commute proved too exhausting at her age, her mother, Lauren Zummo, rented an apartment in the city for the two of them. But when the pandemic hit, Zummo was forced to shut down the Pilates and yoga studio she runs on Long Island, and, of course, Lily lost her income. Zummo was able to walk away from the Manhattan sublet, but not the studio, where her landlord is insisting on being paid.\n\u201cThe virus has bankrupted us, obviously,\u201d Zummo said.This pandemic is primarily a public health crisis, and Broadway has been hit hard by the disease \u2014 multiple members of the \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d cast fell ill, as did a number of theater artists, producers and publicists. The \u201cDoubtfire\u201d family has been relatively fortunate on that front, but not unscathed.\nKorins, the set designer, lost his uncle to Covid-19. He was 80, and had just moved in January from Florida to Yonkers, N.Y., where he fell ill at an assisted-living facility and died at a hospital. \u201cHe died alone, not having spoken to anyone for several days,\u201d Korins said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those unbelievably tragic moments.\u201d\nOthers have found themselves caring for those infected. Calvin L. Cooper, an actor in the ensemble, saw one friend test positive for Covid-19, and then another fall ill.\n\u201cFor nine long, scary days I helped nurse my friend back to stable levels,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is called presumably positive. I am presumably asymptomatic.\u201d\nAnd both members of the show\u2019s choreography team \u2014 Lorin Latarro, the choreographer, and MJ Slinger, her associate, are partnered with doctors who worked with Covid patients. Latarro is married to a neurosurgeon who was redeployed to Covid care; she and their 2-year-old daughter moved out for several weeks to avoid infection. \u201cI know some families have it worse,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are back home together now.\u201d\n\u2018I can\u2019t control if my voice changes.\u2019Maria Dalanno was one of the last people to join the \u201cDoubtfire\u201d cast. She was 18 and still in high school in Ohio when she submitted an audition video shot by her mother; five days later, she booked a part as the understudy for Lydia, the older Hillard daughter.\nShe left high school, deferred college and moved to New York. Now she\u2019s back home, playing with her dog and painting.\n\u201cI made my debut in previews, and then moved right back home in the midst of a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cI am now worrying about following social distancing guidelines, being able to pay for my apartment, and when I will see my new friends and castmates again.\u201d\nFor the six performers playing children in the \u201cDoubtfire\u201d cast \u2014 each character has an understudy \u2014 the shutdown has been particularly tough to understand.\n\u201cGetting a break on Broadway, especially for a child, is nothing short of a miracle,\u201d said Shanna Sell, whose 9-year-old daughter, Avery Sell, was making her Broadway debut as Natalie, the younger Hillard daughter. The Sells live in Florida, and Avery is now back in New Port Richey. \u201cHaving the rug pulled out from underneath her little feet, just weeks before her debut, has been nothing short of heartbreaking,\u201d Shanna Sell said.\nJake Ryan Flynn, the 13-year-old Massachusetts boy who plays the Hillards\u2019 son, Christopher, has his own concern \u2014 that if the Broadway shutdown drags on, he will age out of the role. This is his second Broadway show \u2014 he was one of three boys alternating in the title role of \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d and he knows that contracts allow producers to replace children as they grow too tall.\n\u201cMy parents keep telling me to only worry about what I can control,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now it feels like I\u2019m in control of nothing in my life. I can\u2019t control if I grow. I can\u2019t control if my voice changes. I can\u2019t control when I will see my cast mates again. I can\u2019t control if the creatives and producers take a look at me in a few months and fire me because I\u2019m too big. It just makes me sad.\u201d\n\u2018It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.\u2019The invitations came from Mark Evans, a Welsh actor playing Stuart Dunmire, the new love interest for Miranda Hillard.\nPut on something fun. Grab a snack or a drink. Turn on your computer.On April 5, the night that \u201cDoubtfire\u201d was scheduled to open on Broadway, the company instead gathered online and performed the show \u2014 beginning to end \u2014 just for one another.\nThey called it their Fauxpening. Eighty-two people participated. Kaleigh Cronin, an ensemble member sheltering with her husband and dog at her parents\u2019 house in New Hampshire, wore the dress from her 8th grade dance, which she found in her childhood closet.\nThere were speeches and stories, songs and slip-ups \u2014 Evans was so busy organizing that when the second act rolled around he forgot his lines. Onscreen, the actors sang their songs. In the chat section, some of the stage managers typed out cues.\n\u201cZoom was still a novelty, as opposed to the norm,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.\u201d\nThere are other forms of connection, too. Felicia Shulman, the guardian responsible for protecting the show\u2019s child actors, has tried to knit the four youngest members of the cast together through group texts and FaceTime. \u201cKeeping them all in touch is something that I think is very important during this time of the unknown,\u201d she said.\nThere\u2019s also a newsletter of sorts. Aaron Kaburick, an actor who plays several minor characters including a \u201cChef Louis,\u201d distributes a weekly email. It was originally called \u201cChicken on the Block,\u201d a reference to the show\u2019s spatchcocking scene; it\u2019s now called \u201cChicken on the Couch,\u201d because of the quarantine. The publication is just a few sentences \u2014 fabricated gossip, inside jokes, the ensemble member Doreen Montalvo\u2019s recipe for \u201cQuarantine Coquito\u201d and a \u201cDoubtfire\u201d-choreography-inspired workout routine from Casey Garvin, an understudy.\nAnd there are ongoing get-togethers. Fauxpening was three weeks and three days after the closing, so, at Gambatese\u2019s suggestion, the company decided to plan another reunion every three weeks and three days. The second one was late last month. \u201cIt was adorable,\u201d McClure said. \u201cWe shouted over one another.\u201d\n\u2018It\u2019s so empty, it\u2019s unreal.\u2019The Stephen Sondheim Theater, where \u201cDoubtfire\u201d was being staged, exhibits many of Broadway\u2019s real estate complexities. Its history, and its facade on West 43rd Street, go back to 1918, but the interior, which opened in 2009, is underground, beneath the 55-story Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park.\nThe 1,055-seat theater is operated by a nonprofit, the Roundabout Theater Company, which is renting it to the commercial producers of \u201cMrs. Doubtfire.\u201d\nThe building is still \u201cDoubtfire\u201d-branded, with a marquee and pastel-colored posters promoting the show. But there are also signs of the times: Anita\u2019s Way, a pedestrian passage alongside the theater, has become, with the disappearance of pedestrians, a resting spot for the homeless.\nThe only person still regularly going inside is Deosarran, a one-named 58-year-old Guyanese immigrant who works for Roundabout as a building engineer.\nOnce or twice a week, Deosarran \u2014 everyone calls him Dino \u2014 gets into his car and drives in to Times Square from his home in Harrison, N.J., to make his rounds at the four theaters Roundabout operates in Midtown. He starts early \u2014 around 5 a.m. \u2014 to increase the ease of social distancing, and he checks the buildings\u2019 temperature, the humidity, the plumbing and even the roofs.\n\u201cIn the beginning I was nervous, but I bought some masks and gloves and I mingle with no one,\u201d said Deosarran, who moved to the United States at age 14, took a job pumping gas and has been working in Broadway theaters for most of his adult life. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange to see these theaters with no show. On 42nd Street you see one or two people walking. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nThere are other eyes on the building \u2014 security, cops and a few less expected observers. Connie Robinson, the manager of theater operations for Roundabout, monitors by video camera from her home in the Bronx while baking up a storm \u2014 sweet potato buns, banana pudding cheesecake, crepes. \u201cIt\u2019s so empty, it\u2019s unreal,\u201d she said.\nAnd James Kabel, the wardrobe supervisor, walks over from his apartment in Times Square. He gazes at the \u201cDoubtfire\u201d images on the theater\u2019s windows, just \u201cto make sure it\u2019s not just a dream.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2019m not going to imagine anything but that it\u2019s going to happen.\u2019It was one of the first scenes the writers cooked up: Deep in the second act, Daniel Hillard would have a nightmare in which he is haunted by multiple Mrs. Doubtfires, forcing him to confront his feelings of inadequacy.\nThe power rock song, \u201cYou\u2019ve Created a Monster,\u201d was rousingly sung, wild to look at (a stageful of Doubtfires!), and regularly prompted applause. But gnawing at the creative team was the sense that it stopped the storytelling.\nThe problem: The number as written suggested that Daniel Hillard\u2019s big fear was that Mrs. Doubtfire was better than him. But the musical is fueled by his more fundamental terror: that he would lose his children.\nSo, in one of the surest signs that Team \u201cDoubtfire\u201d fully expects the show to return, the now-dispersed creative team, who previously collaborated on \u201cSomething Rotten!\u201d, overhauled the song via Skype. Wayne Kirkpatrick, back home in Nashville; his brother, Karey Kirkpatrick, in Los Angeles; and John O\u2019Farrell, in London.\nSo they decided to refocus the scene. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a song that\u2019s not moving the story forward,\u201d Karey Kirkpatrick said. \u201cSo we made it about the kids \u2014 they\u2019re no longer dressed as Doubtfires, and there are lyric changes to support the storytelling.\u201d\nAnd they set about shortening the musical\u2019s ending. \u201cYou want to leave them wanting more, as opposed to saying get on with it already,\u201d Karey Kirkpatrick said.\nTrimming was not easy because in the final 12 minutes McClure has six costume changes, from Hillard to Doubtfire and back again \u2014 and each one takes at least 23 seconds. But the writers now have a series of proposed cuts they want to test whenever they get back to the stage.\n\u201cIf you just listen, the show will tell you what it needs,\u201d Karey Kirkpatrick said.\nIt\u2019s unclear what happens next. Industry leaders say that September is the earliest they can imagine Broadway resuming performances, but that it is possible shows won\u2019t return until next year.\nBroadway has multiple vulnerabilities: high costs, tightly packed seating, and a fan base that includes many tourists and seniors.\nThe longer the shutdown continues, the more shows are expected to close before even opening, succumbing to cash flow issues and economic concerns. Zaks, a four-time Tony winner directing on Broadway for the 25th time with \u201cDoubtfire,\u201d refuses even to consider that this show could be among the missing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to imagine anything but that it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\nHe can take solace from McCollum, the lead producer, who vows that \u201cDoubtfire\u201d will return. \u201cI\u2019m sad that everyone has to wait, but the show is ready to go, and when people gather, we\u2019ll be ready to open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re birthing this new piece, and I can\u2019t wait to show it to the world.\u201d\nAs for McClure, the show\u2019s star, he is practicing a combination of patience and optimism.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be in Broadway\u2019s best interest to open too soon and be part of another wave of this \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone in our industry is interested in that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I think about the first night back, when the overture starts and the curtain goes up, I choke up. I really do. It\u2019s the culmination of everything we\u2019re craving \u2014 more than the singing and the dancing and this great American art form, it\u2019s a bunch of people telling a story and a bunch of people receiving a story. We\u2019re craving the collective experience of being human. And that\u2019s what theater is.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":663,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/andre-dawson-mlb-hall-of-famer-funeral-home-owner-coronavirus\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-07","author":[],"title":"This is all worth it\": Andre Dawson, MLB Hall of Famer and funeral home owner, helps families dealing with coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/05\/07\/389a1d50-f57c-4902-bd1f-ef4a711c179f\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/9189e5d11766048bd5d186d79e73dd88\/andre-dawson-02.png","body_text":"From the major leagues to the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, former big league star Andre \"The Hawk\" Dawson is now in a different field.

The event promises to be a powerful rendition of classic songs celebrating the sacrifices of veterans across the United Kingdom and the Allied victory over Nazism on the Western Front.\n\nThe Royal Albert Hall, named by Queen Victoria after her late husband, Prince Albert, remains one of the UK's most iconic concert venues hosting leading acts from across the world since opening its doors in 1871.\n\nRoyal Albert Hall chief executive, Craig Hassall, discussed the unprecedented Victory Day performance and its significance, including ways people can continue to support the arts, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSputnik: What is special about the RAH's 75th VE Day performance? What is its significance and does it symbolise anything for your venue amid the ongoing pandemic?\n\nCraig Hassall: This is the first behind-closed-doors performance in the Hall\u2019s 150-year history. We had originally scheduled a VE Day performance for the 8 May, one of many shows which ultimately had to be cancelled due to the pandemic.\n\nThe Hall has always been a place of national celebration and commemoration, where poignant anniversaries are observed, and while we\u2019ve staged \u2018at home\u2019 versions of other cancelled shows \u2013 with artists coming direct from their living rooms \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have been right for this event.\n\nWith the venue closed for the first time since the Blitz, we felt there was something incredibly powerful about staging a performance in an empty Hall. I also know that, for many, the words of \u2018We\u2019ll Meet Again\u2019 have taken on a special significance in recent weeks, especially after being used by Queen Elizabeth II in her recent address to the nation, and it seemed fitting that Katherine Jenkins should perform that song as a virtual duet with Vera Lynn.\n\nThe event promises to be an extremely moving communal experience for people all over the world.\n\nSputnik: What kinds of support was provided to the venue and artist Katherine Jenkins OBE during the course of rehearsals?\n\nCraig Hassall: It has involved a huge amount of planning, with the safety of everyone involved \u2013 artists, crew and staff \u2013 of paramount importance. We have a fantastic relationship with Katherine and were thrilled that she wanted to be involved.\n\nThe help we have had from her team, promoter Snappin\u2019 Turtle, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) armed forces charity, YouTube and the Mayor of London\u2019s office in making this event happen, has been truly extraordinary and we\u2019re so grateful to them.\n\nParadise, Andy Craig Hassall, Royal Albert Hall CEO. 21 April 2017\n\nSputnik: How has the Royal Albert Hall been affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, and how can people support the venue in these difficult times?\n\nCraig Hassall: We are facing enormous financial challenges at the moment. From March to May, we would have expected to take in around \u00a38.5m, instead we refunded \u00a33m in tickets.\n\nWe\u2019re doing our best to keep entertaining the world during our closure, but our famous building is at risk, and the show can\u2019t go on without support and donations. So now is really the chance for anyone who loves this place to show their appreciation and help us protect the future of the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nSputnik: What kinds of feedback have you received from audiences watching the online streams? Do you believe such performances will inspire interest in the arts amongst new demographics once the lockdown has been lifted?\n\nCraig Hassall: We\u2019ve had an incredible response to the Royal Albert Home series so far, with shows being streamed more than half a million times and audiences getting in touch from Kentucky to Kazakhstan to tell us how much the performances have meant to them during a difficult time.\n\n\u2014 Mayor of London (gov.uk\/coronavirus) (@MayorofLondon) May 7, 2020\n\nThe Hall exists promote a love of the arts and sciences, and during the closure this project has become a central part of that.

We know about the antimicrobial properties of copper, so we thought 'Can we do something, can we help out here?'\"\nCopper's disinfectant powers have long been known and its antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties have been supported by scientific studies.\nSpee3D commissioned Melbourne laboratory 360biolabs to look at how SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, reacts to copper surfaces.\nThe results showed that 96% of the virus was killed off in two hours and 99.2% in 5 hours, compared to no change on stainless steel surfaces over the same period, Kennedy said.\nThis is in line with a U.S.-government funded study https:\/\/bit.ly\/2WdhxZR published in March that found SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for up to 4 hours on copper, compared with 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.\nSpee3D then reset some of its machines to be able to coat surfaces such as door handles and push plates, and has already received orders from two Australian government departments to resurface door handles before staff return to work.\nThe Northern Territory's Trade, Business and Innovation Department said in a statement it was thrilled to adopt the technology to make its workplace safer.\nThe firm is also speaking with a big miner and several major door handle manufacturers about additional applications, Kennedy said.\nSLOW TAKE-UPCopper had already been making some inroads into the healthcare sector after trials in hospitals, including in the U.S. state of Virginia https:\/\/www.ajicjournal.org\/article\/S0196-6553(16)30696-4\/fulltext, in recent years.\nHowever, attempts by fabricators in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to sell copper alloy products into the sector resulted in only a modest take-up, partly due to costs, said John Fennell, Chief Executive of the International Copper Association Australia.\n\"We are seeing outcrops of people adopting this, but not as much as you would have thought,\" he said.\nCOVID-19 looks set to give the metal a boost.In major copper producer Chile, the country's mines minister recently touted the use of copper in face masks, such as those produced by a U.S.-Chilean company, while U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan believes the pandemic will shine a light on how copper can help improve public health.\n\"Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper, which has been a barrier in the past, is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic,\" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told a briefing last week.\nNew manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are also a potential game-changer as they can allow ultra-thin coatings to be applied quickly, while still taking advantage of copper's antimicrobial properties and cutting the amount of metal used, and therefore the cost.\nThe price of coating a standard office door handle is about A$50-A$100 ($33-$65), says Kennedy, although costs will fall over time.\nDisappointing copper bulls, it's likely the new coating methods will keep a lid on the amount of metal used in healthcare, said analyst Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank in Melbourne.\n\"I think we can confidently say demand for copper for those uses will go up, quite possibly by a lot. Is that going to shift the dial for global demand?

Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is \"good.\"\n\nNeil Dutta is head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.\n\nThis is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWith the stock market rallying sharply off its March 23 low, the usual cries have started: stocks are missing the economic reality, they're whistling by the graveyard, they're completely divorced from economic fundamentals.\n\nIn the last week: the Economist claims \"A dangerous gap has opened between America's stock market and the real economy.\" Noted economic pundit Mohamed El-Erian argued that the \"Market keeps distancing itself from the economy.\" But that is not so surprising early on.\n\nAdmittedly, current economic conditions are poor. Economic output has cratered, leaving widespread joblessness in its wake.\n\nBut this does not necessarily mean equity prices should be substantially lower than they are now. The US equity market is not about whether economic conditions are good or bad. Rather, what matters is whether conditions are improving or getting worse.\n\nToday, the evidence is mounting that economic conditions, while far from good, are starting to improve. This is why stocks are up.\n\nHitting the bottom\n\nGenerally speaking, economic conditions can be thought of in two ways: momentum and level of activity. The momentum in the economy represents how quickly conditions are changing in relation to the past while level of activity in the economy measures how far conditions are from their historical averages.\n\nFor instance, the US can add thousands of jobs \u2014 that shows positive momentum \u2014 while the unemployment rate \u2014 the level \u2014 remains well above its historically average. Momentum needs to be positive in order for the level of activity to improve.\n\nConsider the period following the 2009 recession. It took many years for the level of economic activity to return to potential, as the chart below demonstrates. Even as potential growth repeatedly got revised down, the level of growth hit potential sometime in 2017. Still, this period was an especially good one for stock prices even if for many, it \"didn't feel like\" a recovery.\n\nToday, the evidence is mounting that the level of activity has bottomed \u2013 that is, conditions are not getting any worse \u2013 and the momentum in the economy has picked up somewhat.\n\nMotor gasoline demand bottomed for the week ending April 10 and has been climbing, retracing about one-third of its decline since mid-March.\n\nMortgage purchase applications also bottomed for the week ending April 10, similarly recouping about 40 percent of its plunge since mid-March.\n\nPassenger screenings at our nation's airports are also on the mend. The count is now about double the April 14 low, but still 93% off its year-ago level.\n\nNotice that the timing of this improvement precedes the formal lifting of shelter-in-place orders for nearly all states. Thus, it stands to reason that there is room for at least some improvement once formal lockdowns end.\n\nOf course, there are risks to the outlook. Double-dips in the economy are usually about policy choices. Almost always, double-dips are about policy choices after a recovery starts.\n\nFor example, in 1982, the economy saw a deep recession after a brief recovery because the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates to take on inflation. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, the policy choice would be to shut parts of the economy down if the virus spread gets worse.\n\nThat said, markets have rallied for good reason and the message from stocks is not all that different from what I see in the economy. Economic conditions are no longer getting worse and the re-opening is likely to be measured. Still, we see modest improvement across a range of metrics.\n\nDoes that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is \"good.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":704,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/05\/08\/852487751\/how-a-virtual-powwow-helped-heal-a-spirit-broken-during-the-pandemic","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-05-08","author":"['Rose Friedman', 'Ted Robbins']","title":"How A Virtual Powwow Helped Heal A Spirit Broken During The Pandemic","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/05\/07\/oxendine_wide-991332b2b6ad215c2f1e82322d1ab851052a2c63.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"How A Virtual Powwow Helped Heal A Spirit Broken During The Pandemic\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kay Oxendine Courtesy of Kay Oxendine\n\nIt's powwow season \u2014 the time of year when across the country, Native American tribes should be getting together to celebrate their culture with food, dancing, singing and drumming.

She was set to be the first woman to emcee her tribe's powwow, scheduled for Friday, April 17, to Sunday April 19, at the Tribal Ceremonial Grounds in Hollister, N.C.\n\nAbout 5,000 people would've been there, but she knew it would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. What she says she didn't expect was that her mind and body were still expecting the celebration.\n\n\"So I wake up on Friday morning and it's like I wake up and I open my eyes and I'm looking, oh, my God, it's here!

He was 75.\n\nHorn died of complications from the coronavirus on Friday in a Las Vegas hospital, according to a statement released by publicist Dave Kirvin.\n\n\u201cToday, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,\u201d Siegfried Fischbacher said in the statement. \u201cFrom the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.\u201d\n\nHe was injured in October 2003 when a tiger named Montecore attacked him on stage at the Mirage hotel-casino in Las Vegas. He had severe neck injuries, lost a lot of blood and later suffered a stroke. He underwent lengthy rehabilitation, but the attack ended the long-running Las Vegas Strip production.\n\nThe darker-haired of the flashy duo, Horn was credited with the idea of introducing an exotic animal \u2014 his pet cheetah \u2014 to the magic act.\n\n\u201cRoy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days,\u201d Fischbacher said. \u201cI give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe two became an institution in Las Vegas, where their magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. The pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year.\n\nThey returned to the stage in February 2009 for what was billed as their one and only comeback performance, to raise funds for the new Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. The brief performance, which included Montecore, became the basis of an episode of the ABC television show \u201c20\/20.\u201d\n\nHorn and Siegfried Fischbacher, both natives of Germany, had first teamed up in 1957 and made their Las Vegas debut a decade later. Siegfried & Roy began performing at the Mirage in 1990.\n\nWhen they signed a lifetime contract with the Mirage in 2001, it was estimated they had performed 5,000 shows at the casino for 10 million fans since 1990 and had grossed more than $1 billion. That comes on top of thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years.\n\n\u201cThroughout the history of Las Vegas, no artists have meant more to the development of Las Vegas\u2019 global reputation as the entertainment capital of the world than Siegfried and Roy,\u201d Terry Lanni, chairman of MGM Mirage, the casino\u2019s parent company, said after the attack.\n\nThe pair gained international recognition for helping to save rare white tigers and white lions from extinction. Their $10 million compound was home to dozens of rare animals over the years. The white lions and white tigers were the result of a preservation program that began in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the white tigers and white lions are going into the 21st century,\u201d Horn said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe bad news is that if we don\u2019t do something about the tigers in the wild, they will disappear.\u201d\n\nSiegfried & Roy\u2019s show, incorporating animal antics and magic tricks, included about 20 white tigers and lions, the number varying depending on the night. The show also had other exotic animals, including an elephant.\n\n\u201cTheir show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the next dazzlement,\u201d an Associated Press reviewer wrote in 1989 when they brought their act to New York.\n\n\u201cA white car drives on stage \u2014 as Liberace used to do \u2014 bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs. Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With Roy on his back, they\u2019re pulled into the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Las Vegas show and it\u2019s nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers aren\u2019t too sophisticated for this.\u201d\n\nA later spectacular developed for the Mirage opened with a flashy \u201cStar Wars\u201d scenario and Horn and Fischbacher arriving in their own mini space capsules. Another segment had Horn sitting atop a 30-foot (9.1-meter) pyramid that was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by an explosion and fire, leaving him levitated high above the stage.\n\nIt was halfway during a performance Oct. 3, 2003, when Horn was alone on stage with the tiger that it suddenly lunged at him.\n\nHorn, who had turned 59 that day, had never been injured during a show before, \u201cnot a scratch, not by an animal,\u201d Bernie Yuman, the pair\u2019s longtime manager, said at the time.\n\nHe said he thought Montecore, a 7-year-old male, got distracted by something in the audience and Horn was trying to calm him. Horn himself said later that he fainted and the tiger was trying to help him by dragging him offstage, though animal experts disputed that possibility.\n\nAn investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture explored a variety of theories but was unable to reach a conclusion on what caused the tiger to attack. In its final report, the USDA also said the show\u2019s producers had failed to protect the audience because there was no barrier separating the exotic animals from the crowd.\n\nIn October 2006, three years after the attack, Horn and Fischbacher attended their induction into the Las Vegas Walk of Stars. Horn\u2019s speech was sluggish at times and he walked a bit slow, but he called the event \u201ca deeply emotional experience.\u201d\n\nBorn in Nordenham, Germany, Horn met Fischbacher on a cruise ship in 1957. Fischbacher performed the magic tricks, while Horn became his assistant, eventually suggesting using the cheetah in the act.\n\nThey honed their animal-magic show in small clubs in Germany and Switzerland in the mid-1960s. Their break came in a Monte Carlo casino when an agent in the audience invited them to Las Vegas. The pair made their debut at the Tropicana hotel-casino in the late 1960s.\n\nThe illusionists became popular in the 1970s, receiving their first star billing in 1978 as headliners of the Stardust\u2019s \u201cLido de Paris.\u201d Their show \u201cBeyond Belief\u201d opened in 1981 at the Frontier and played to thousands over seven years.\n\nWhen Horn and Fischbacher became U.S. citizens in 1988, an elated Horn said, \u201cBeing an American means all the things we believe in.\u201d\n\nHorn once hand-fed a white lion cub born prematurely, starting with an eyedropper.

Hundreds of Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nation\u2019s first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have hurled century-old slurs like \u201cChinaman.\u201d\n\nDaniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TV\u2019s \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim, who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels \u201cback to 100%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But it\u2019s part of the price one pays for speaking out, even against something as seemingly universal as injustice,\u201d Kim said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nThe five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian Americans\u2019 impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century through 9\/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, \u201cFresh Off the Boat\u201d star Randall Park and a host of people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured.\n\nMay is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when Asians\u2019 contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted.\n\nThe virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month, Korean American actor John Cho wrote how \u201cbelonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who \u2018brought\u2019 the virus here.\u201d\n\nThat anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said.\n\n\u201cThose who forget history are condemned to repeat it,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAsian Americans have a unique history in America. It\u2019s one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part of our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nRenee Tajima-Pe\u00f1a, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s.\n\n\u201cWe start at a time where we can still find people, if they\u2019re descendants, with pictures and photographs,\u201d Tajima-Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cOn the one hand, there was choosing which stories we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, it\u2019s TV. We have to make sure it\u2019s something that\u2019s watchable and the audience can engage with.\u201d\n\nThe series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit.\n\nBut it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress.\n\nThere\u2019s also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\nComedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary \u201cThe Problem With Apu,\u201d speaks in the series about post-9\/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time.\n\nLike Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time.\n\n\u201cI had never been targeted the way I had been in 9\/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,\u201d he said at a virtual town hall last week. \u201cThe generation after 9\/11 ... they\u2019re gonna have to question where we are now. It\u2019s going to inform how they will see the world.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary.\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s on PBS, it feels like an official document,\u201d Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. \u201cThis marks our place in the history of this country. It wasn\u2019t there before.\u201d\n\nTajima-Pe\u00f1a wouldn\u2019t alter the episodes to address the pandemic if she could, saying viewers will inevitably connect it to present-day xenophobia. It\u2019s a \u201cnew story that really is an old story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole COVID crisis, it\u2019s really just amplified all the fault lines in the United States of race and class, poverty, health care. In terms of Asian Americans, of course, it\u2019s this idea we\u2019re so-called foreigners,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of her hopes is the series will inspire younger Asian Americans to think beyond social media rants to activism.\n\n\u201cOur backs are against the walls. How do we move forward together? That\u2019s what you see in the series,\u201d Tajima-Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cAsian Americans had to come together to defend our own rights.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":713,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/coronavirus-bravery-and-hope-7-days-on-the-front-line-nyc-hospital-covid-19\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-08","author":[],"title":"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line\" takes viewers inside NYC hospital amid COVID-19 pandemic","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/05\/10\/1a89e591-323d-4a01-ba2c-4c8558d4b03c\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/617e8f02f58e8a07e67a134962ac7323\/bravery-new-482373-640x360.jpg","body_text":"In the midst of a pandemic that has paralyzed the world, a team of CBS News journalists embedded with emergency physicians and critical care specialists struggling to save patients suffering from COVID-19 in \"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line,\" a one-hour, primetime special set at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. The special will air Friday, May 15, at 9 p.m. ET\/PT on CBS.\n\n\"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line\" goes to the floors of the largest hospital in the hardest-hit borough of New York City. Montefiore Medical Center's Moses Campus was bursting with nearly 700 patients, 80% of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nA CBS News team, clad in protective equipment, spent seven days in the emergency department and intensive care units following physicians as they urgently placed patients on breathing machines and resuscitated others suffering cardiac failure.\n\nThe medical staff fear getting sick and exposing their families, even as they treat the gravely ill.\n\n\"We're often talking about life and death situations. There are no small emergencies. They'e all patients having respiratory distress or cardiac arrest,\" says Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of Critical Care Medicine.\n\nThe hospital had to convert an auditorium to treat the staggering increase in COVID-19 patients \u2014 70 of whom died during the week CBS News was embedded.\n\nAlongside the loss, there are victories: In that same time span, more than 300 patients recovered and were able to go home.\n\nNurse Jasmine Christakos, a Bronx native, dances whenever the hospital overhead speaker announces a \"happy code,\" signaling a patient has been discharged or taken off a ventilator.\n\n\"It's just so hopeful and brings so much joy during dark times and reminds us that people do go home \u2026 people do beat this,\" Christakos says.\n\nThe documentary captures the toll the disease has taken on one of the poorest and worst-stricken neighborhoods in New York City and the nation. A Bronx father lights candles and prays that his son, a first responder, will recover and come home from the hospital. From the back of a pickup truck, a parish priest rolls through the neighborhood with a loudspeaker, blessing the sick and homebound.\n\nAnd a Montefiore nurse, Selena Thomas, grows weary as she counts the lives lost to a cruel and mysterious virus.\n\n\"It's necessary for us to acknowledge that some communities have been touched by COVID more than others,\" Thomas says. \"If we don't acknowledge that we can't fix the problem.\"\n\n\"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line\" tells the story of a global crisis through the people of one city, one community, and one hospital.\n\n\"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line\" is produced by Andrew Bast, T.

Combined, they account for some of the biggest economic and labor casualties of the COVID-19 pandemic as stay-at home-orders have grounded potential customers and diners and put businesses on the brink.\n\nWhile financial recovery programs still find their footing, in the past couple of weeks, a few Illinois small businesses have discovered a different kind of lifeline thanks to a wave of national exposure that has put an emphasis on goods from Chicago and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe now have something we didn\u2019t have before \u2014 hope,\u201d said Lake Forest resident Cindy Kienzle, the founder and owner of The Hungry Monkey Baking Co., after her baked goods were evangelized by comedian\/TV personality Howie Mandel on the growing online platform Talkshop Live.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201clive streaming selling vehicle for anyone, anywhere at any time,\u201d said Talkshop Live co-founder Bryan Moore. Or, as others like Forbes have playfully called it, \u201cQVC meets Facebook Live.\u201d\n\nLaunched two years ago, the social media retail platform was inspired by a mission to \u201csave Main Street\u201d and offers member business owners the chance to have a \u201cstorefront\u201d without the overhead. Once registered on the free app, members are given a dedicated online channel, and followers are automatically notified any time the member business goes live.\n\n\u201c[Membership] has gone up considerably post COVID-19,\u201d said Moore. \u201cWe are finding a lot of people are starting to use us as a resource to stay viable.\u201d\n\nThe Talkshop Live team had been in talks with Mandel, the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d judge (and a one-time carpet salesman), before the pandemic hit. But as soon as stores started shutting down, Mandel partnered with the platform in a \u201cSave Small Business America\u201d campaign. Mandel pitches his favorite products in bi-weekly episodes; members can also submit an application on Mandel\u2019s Talkshop Live page.\n\nThe first episode ran April 1 and featured The Hungry Monkey Baking Co.\u2019s Social Distancing Treat Boxes, a gift box that includes loaves of traditional banana bread, chocolate chip banana bread as well as two small bags of triple chocolate brownies. All come from Kienzle\u2019s homemade recipes and are made in a commercial kitchen in Northbrook.\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a dream to own a bakery,\u201d Kienzle said, and by 2010 she had started her small business in the Northfield Farmer\u2019s Market and is now selling in local food emporiums such as Sunset Foods and Olivia\u2019s Market.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic hit, it\u2019s not the kind of product you are going to necessarily Instacart,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I was concerned about what was going to happen.\u201d\n\nSo, Kienzle became an early adopter of Talkshop Live. Mandel came across her channel while looking for businesses to profile, and was particularly moved by Kienzle\u2019s 12-year-old daughter Lily who has special needs and helps her mother assemble the gift boxes. In his pitch for the product, Mandel said the banana bread \u201cis beyond anything I have ever eaten\u201d and his testimonial helped Kienzle increase sales from about 150 to 200 gift boxes in a year to 800 within a month.\n\n\u201cPlus, we have received many calls from corporate clients wishing to donate Hungry Monkey [products] to our local communities, and to cheer up clients and their staff,\u201d Kienzle said. \u201c\u2026For our tiny company it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nThe April 15 edition of Mandel\u2019s show featured Save The Girls, a maker of fashionable and functional cellphone purses, based in Belleville, Illinois.\n\n\u201cAll within the same week, my two daughters lost their iPhones. One out on a walking trail and the other accidentally left hers in a pair of jeans she washed,\u201d recalls owner Tami Lange. \u201cAs I was talking about the issue with my sister-in-law, she pulls her own phone out of her bra \u2014 the woman has breast cancer! I knew there had to be a better way to protect your phone.\u201d\n\nLange\u2019s company, which launched a cell phone \u201ctouchscreen purse\u201d design that allows for ease of functionality and protection, sold $1 million in its first year in 2018, $3 million in 2019 and was on track to sell $5 million this year \u2014 until COVID-19 hit.\n\n\u201cWe are in about 2,500 retail locations that were all shut down,\u201d says Lange. \u201cAs a result, our sales went down by over 95%.\u201d Lange\u2019s sister told her about Mandel\u2019s program and she filled out an application. Mandel, a well-known germaphobe, loved the design for its \u201cgerm-free\u201d aspect as well as the fact that Lange donates 10% of profits to breast cancer research.\n\nBucktown\u2019s popular dining spot Mable\u2019s Table also got a national exposure business boost after being featured in a segment on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in late April.\n\n\u201cWe received a call from one of the producers who had some friends that lived in our neighborhood,\u201d said chef\/owner Anthony Reyes.\n\nThe restaurant is currently offering curbside service and deliveries through Caviar and Grubhub. The \u201cGMA\u201d segment also highlighted Reyes\u2019 efforts to help his neighbors during the coronavirus pandemic. He has donated rolls of toilet paper, paper towels, soap and flour to anyone in the neighborhood in need \u2014 inspired to do his part after witnessing the work of his wife who is a nurse practitioner, and his brother, a Chicago police officer.\n\nThe \u201cGMA\u201d segment also featured a \u201chow-to\u201d for making the restaurant\u2019s famous jumbo meatballs.\n\n\u201cThe menu is based on good old-fashioned home cooking, and I think a lot of people at home are focused on that now, too,\u201d said Reyes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the restaurant was serving about 1,000 people a week, but once the restaurant closed its doors, the 30-employee staff went down to five people. \u201cThe one thing most important to me is to be able to bring them all back,\u201d said Reyes, hoping the national exposure will help in that mission.\n\n\u201cUsually I sell about 150 meatballs throughout the week, but in two days I\u2019ve sold almost 400,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople from as far as Georgia have been calling and e-mailing to get a hold of the recipe and calculating conversions.\u201d\n\nReyes is appreciative of \u201cGMA\u201d giving the restaurant a voice, and said: \u201cI would love when things get back to normal to have people come in here and say \u2018I saw you on the show, I want to try to those meatballs!\u2019\u201d\n\nSelena Fragassi is a local freelance writer.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":743,"url":"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/sorrento-therapeutics-stock-price-surges-covid-19-drug-development-claim-2020-5-1029207624","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-10","author":"['Finanzen.Net Gmbh']","title":"Sorrento Therapeutics skyrockets 244% after claiming a breakthrough on a COVID-19 antibody (SRNE)","image":"https:\/\/images.markets.businessinsider.com\/image\/5ebedddd3ad86110c3126d07-2000\/sorrento-therapeutics.jpg","body_text":"Reuters\n\nShares of Sorrento Therapeutics spiked as much as 244% on Friday after the company said an antibody it was developing showed \"100% inhibition\" of the COVID-19 virus in preclinical studies.\n\nThe small biotechnology company said it aimed to create \"an antibody cocktail that would act as a 'protective shield'\" against the coronavirus.\n\nSorrento said the full results of from its experiments would be \"submitted to a peer-reviewed publication shortly.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSorrento Therapeutics skyrocketed as much as 244% on Friday after the company said an antibody it was developing showed \"100% inhibition\" of the COVID-19 virus in preclinical studies.\n\nThe small biotechnology company said it planned to \"generate an antibody cocktail product that would act as a 'protective shield' against SARS-CoV-2,\" the official name of the novel coronavirus.\n\nSorrento said it would ask regulators for \"priority evaluation and accelerated review\" of its antibody candidate.

Many economists predicted a V-shaped journey for the economy: A sharp drop, then a quick bounce-back as the virus faded and the economy regained health.\n\nOthers envisioned a slower, U-shaped course.\n\nNow, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans press to reopen the economy, some experts see an ominous risk: That a too-hasty relaxation of social distancing could ignite a resurgence of COVID-19 cases by fall, sending the economy back into lockdown. The result: a W-shaped disaster in which a tentative recovery would sink back into a \u201cdouble-dip\u201d recession before rebounding eventually.\n\n\u201cThe push to reopen the economy is making a W-shaped recovery very much more likely,\u201d said Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nIn Frankel\u2019s view, any widespread reopening should wait for a sustained drop in death rates and the broad availability of tests. No one is completely safe until an effective treatment or vaccine can be produced and widely distributed \u2014 a scenario that\u2019s likely many months away.\n\nFrankel said he also worries that the government might prematurely withdraw financial aid to the economy, thereby weakening the pillars of any tentative recovery.\n\n\u201cA W-shaped recovery is a distinct possibility,\u201d said Yongseok Shin, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cUnless the reopening is carefully managed with extensive testing and voluntary social distancing, infections will rapidly rise in many localities.\n\n\u201cPeople will then hunker down for fear of infection, and local governments will re-impose lockdowns, quashing any economic recovery we will have had to that point.\u2019\u2019\n\nA double-dip recession would significantly heighten the risks for an already debilitated U.S. economy. Congress has provided roughly $3 trillion in aid \u2014 by far its largest rescue ever \u2014 to help households and companies survive the next few months. That short-term aid, though, assumes any recovery will last. If a second downturn were to flare up, it\u2019s far from clear that Congress would be ready to offer trillions more to enable businesses to survive yet another round of months-long shutdowns.\n\nNor do many companies have the cash reserves to cushion against a second recession. And just as threatening, a double-tip downturn would sap the confidence of individuals and businesses that is essential to an economic bounce-back. If consumers don\u2019t trust that a recovery will last, many won\u2019t resume spending, and the economy would struggle to rebound.\n\nOn Monday, plastic spacing barriers and millions of masks appeared on the streets of Europe\u2019s newly reopened cities as France and Belgium emerged from lockdowns, the Netherlands sent children back to school and Spain allowed people to eat outdoors. All faced the delicate balance of restarting battered economies without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.\n\nIn the United States, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has urged caution in reopening the economy. Powell has warned against taking \u201ctoo much risk of second and third waves\u2019\u2019 of the virus.\n\nFor now, the economy is essentially in free-fall. It shed a record 20.5 million jobs in April. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. The gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of output \u2014 shrank at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March and is expected to post an astounding 40% annual collapse in the current quarter. That would be, by far, the worst on record dating to 1947.\n\nFacing a catastrophe in an election year, Trump and many Republican allies are eager to ease restrictions and restart the economy. They say the use of masks and other protections should allow many businesses to safely reopen under certain guidelines. Trump has openly backed protests that are intended to compel governors to \u201cliberate\u2019\u2019 their states from lockdowns.\n\nBut The Associated Press reported last week that many U.S. governors are disregarding White House guidelines. Seventeen states didn\u2019t meet a key benchmark set by the White House for beginning to reopen businesses: A 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates.\n\nTexas\u2019 Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has gone so far as to suggest that restarting the economy might be worth the risk of some additional deaths.\n\n\u201cThere are more important things than living,\u2019\u2019 Patrick said in an interview with Fox News. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, nobody wants to die, but man, we got to take some risks and get back in the game and get this country back up and running.\u201d\n\nMost Americans say they\u2019re wary of trying to return to business as normal now. A Pew Research Center survey found that 68% said they feared that state governments would lift restrictions too soon. Just 31% wanted restrictions lifted sooner.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you just turn the spigot back on is just ridiculous,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the consulting firm Grant Thornton. \u201dIt\u2019s still a COVID-tainted spigot. No one wants water from a poisoned well.\u2019\u2019\n\nMany businesses are also tempering their optimism. The data firm Womply found that even in Texas and Florida, states that are being especially aggressive about reopening their economies, businesses are moving slowly. Womply found only a \u201csmall-to-negligible drop\u2019\u2019 in the share of Texas and Florida businesses that remain closed.\n\n\u201cThis could signal that previously closed businesses may have trouble figuring out how to open with new guidelines, attracting patrons, or may be closed indefinitely,\u201d Womply concluded.\n\nAt Big Buzz, a health care marketing consultancy in Denver, CEO Wendy Phillips is expecting \u201cmore a W-shaped than a V-shaped\u2019\u2019 rebound. Phillips has reduced her staff from eight to six, two of whom kept their full-time jobs only after the government delivered a $105,000 loan under a rescue program for small businesses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much unknown looking forward,\u2019\u2019 Phillips said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a good two or three years, at a minimum, of recession.\u2019\u2019\n\nFrankel at the Harvard Kennedy School and others worry that state and local governments, hemorrhaging tax revenue, will be forced to make growth-stunting cuts just as a recovery might be straining to gain traction.\n\nAnother threat is the prospect of bankruptcies and cash shortfalls for companies and households. Some have been able to defer rent and other payments but will eventually have to repay their landlords and other creditors in full.\n\nLikewise, U.S. authorities declared premature victory over the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, only to see it return, deadlier than before. In the current pandemic, South Korea eased restrictions as cases dropped. But on Saturday, Seoul had to shut down nightclubs, bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to club goers.\n\nLast week, researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health warned that easing stay-at-home orders and allowing people to mingle more freely would mean that \u201cnew COVID-19 cases and deaths will rebound in late May.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Columbia researchers predict a resurgence of cases two to four weeks after states begin to reopen.\n\n\u201cThe lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of COVID-19 until it is well underway,\u201d said the lead researcher, Jeffrey Shaman.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":759,"url":"https:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/notice-non-consent-say-no-big-brother-bill-hr-6666-and-preserve-your-rights","publisher":"GreenMedInfo","publish_date":"2020-05-11","author":[],"title":"NOTICE of NON-CONSENT to say NO to the \"Big Brother\" bill (HR 6666) and preserve YOUR RIGHTS!","image":"https:\/\/cdn.greenmedinfo.com\/sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/ogimage\/blog\/updatedphoto.jpg","body_text":"Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 1, 2020, 45 congress members co-sponsored Bill HR 6666, proposing to spend $100 BILLION dollars in 2020 to hire \"contact tracers\", coronavirus testers, and reporting agents. If passed, this would create an unprecedented new mega-industry for what appears to be a type of \"medical martial law\".\n\nProponents of this bill apparently want to hire a massive number of staff to enforce \"social distancing\", administer tests in our homes -- apparently whether we consent or not -- and apparently even grant themselves the right to take people who \"test positive\" from their homes!\n\nThe full name of this bill HR 6666 -- yes, that's the actual bill number -- is the \"COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act\". As many of you know, what is referred to as \"contact tracing\" is more aptly called total Big Brother surveillance.\n\nVentura, California recently announced their own draconian measure threatening to forcibly test and remove people from their homes if \"necessary\"... though they subsequently backtracked probably due to the massive pushback.\n\nAs many of us have come to realize (not a comfortable process), there is INDEED an agenda to lock humanity into a so-called \"new normal\" reality of technocratic policing and constant monitoring. Self-appointed technocrats and their organizations want to have us vaccinated and tracked with wireless and, it strongly appears, biometrics.\n\nBut millions are waking up and sharing information. This is a fight for the soul of humanity, and we're learning what it means to combine love and action.\n\nYOU'VE AWAKENED. NOW LET'S COME TOGETHER AND ACT.\n\nThis instant action is the first step. It will be sent to each of YOUR elected reps, at the Federal, State and Municipal level.\n\nWe have about 80% coverage at the local level... i.e. so for most of you, you'll be able to instantly send to your Mayor and Councillors. Also, we currently have USA nationwide coverage, and will add several other countries shortly.\n\n\n\nIn this action, we'll use strong yet respectful language to 1) ask them to stop HR 6666 and all similar legislation, *AND* 2) remove our consent for all violations to our Constitutional Rights -- including those occuring during this crisis.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF NON-CONSENT\n\nDoing this simple action is powerful! In legal and contractual terms, there's a mechanism called \"implied consent\", or \"tacit acceptance.\" That means that, once you've been notified of (or even learned about) a thing, if you haven't said NO, you've said YES.\n\n\n\nBecause this is a free-will universe, those that pull the strings in our society want us to be informed of their agenda... to be in fear about it... and to not go further than sharing information, signing petitions (which do not remove our consent), and perhaps demonstrating.\n\nThese types of actions are all well and good, but they do not go deep enough, because we can do all of these things and still be in a position of legally \/ contractually having consented to the situation -- or, in contractual terms, to their \"offer\".\n\nBut when we begin to realize who we are, the power we have, and the terrible charade happening in our world that is intended to bind us, we can turn the tables, then create what we want instead. Removing our consent and standing with our unalienable* rights, granted by our Creator (as recognized in the Constitution), is a significant and powerful first step.\n\n* unalienable: that which cannot be seprated from you.\n\n\n\nBELOW IS THE NOTICE TEMPLATE WE'LL HELP YOU INSTANTLY SEND.\n\nNOTE: Since you are the one with power, you are the reponsible party. It's important that you read the Notice in full; and since it's editable, customize it accordingly (on Step 2) so that you are in full agreement with what you are sending.\n\nDear [Elected Rep's Name],\n\nBelow are critically important questions, evidence, facts, and my NOTICE OF TERMS to you in your public and private capacities.\n\nTransmission of this notice has been electronically recorded. Thank you for reading this notice, sent to you in good faith, and without ill-intent. Please respond ASAP.\n\nIn this current crisis, measures have been undertaken which are harming me against my consent. Further malicious actions are being threatened against me, and against the rule of law itself.\n\nA central example is the TRACE Act (HR 6666), proposing $100 BILLION in 2020 to create an industry of \"contact tracers\" - a ubiquitous, fascist surveillance network - to enforce testing and apparently to grant the \"authority\" to remove people from their dwellings. See: bit.ly\/bill6666\n\nThis action is egregious and, for federal officials, I ask you to immediately stop this bill. For all officials: stop all anti-Constitution legislation, and pass laws preserve all Constitutional rights and the rule of law in this country.\n\nPLAIN STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA. I have unalienable rights recognized in the original U.S. Constitution that cannot be superseded by any agenda, nor be removed from me. I understand these laws of the land to be active and currently valid. If this is not the case, please send verification in writing within 72 hours.\n\nB. My unalienable rights are being harmed by agendas implemented by oath-sworn elected officials, corporate executives and\/or non-elected officials (collectively \"Agents Of Harm\"). These include, without limitation:\n\ni. My free rights to speak, travel, do commerce, work, assemble, and be free of surveillance without warrant.\n\nii. A threat of medical procedures or experimentation without my consent.\n\niii. Threats of punitive detention, violence and or assault for non-compliance.\n\nC. My unalienable rights are NOT conditional - i.e. subject to proving I am not contagious, nor submitting to surveillance, nor anything that would cause me harm - properly called \"extortion\".\n\nNOTICE OF TERMS\n\nEffective immediately, and until each of the below questions are answered to my satisfaction, LET IT BE KNOWN throughout all jurisdictions and dimensions that:\n\nA. I DO NOT CONSENT to being harmed by any imposition of quarantine, or restriction on my right to assemble, work, travel, speak or do commerce.\n\nB. I DO NOT CONSENT to being told to live in fear, nor made to wear a mask, nor being mandated an allowable proximity to others.\n\nC. I DO NOT CONSENT to any offer of forced medical experimentation or testing; nor forced medical procedure (i.e. vaccine, or substance delivered by air, water, or other means without my knowledge and consent); nor exposure to radiation from 4G\/5G\/wireless deployments; nor being tracked by any technology or biometric device on or adjacent to my body.\n\nD. I HEREBY ACCEPT YOUR OATH OF OFFICE as your sworn statement that binds you to uphold my Constitutional rights, protect me from harm once noticed, and to liability when acting with negligence or without duty of care.\n\nE. I RESERVE ALL OF MY RIGHTS, nunc pro tunc, to pursue remedy for ALL harm AND THREATS OF HARM, which may constitute CRIMINAL ASSAULT, and or tort, caused or contributed by Agents Of Harm. I intend to seek remedy and lawful justice unless and until the stated harmful actions cease and desist.\n\nIf you do not agree with my lawful ability to state and realize these claims and terms, please make your case in writing within 72 hours. If I receive no response from you, or if you offer any response that violates the supremacy of the original U.S. Constitution and you do not disprove my claim that the U.S. Constitution is active and valid, I will deem you to be in agreement and will proceed accordingly.\n\nQUESTIONS AND EVIDENCE\n\n1.

But a practical consequence of such denial-mentality is America will lose the \u201cwar\u201d against COVID-19.\n\nOn the occasion marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazi Third Reich, the Trump White House made no mention of the Soviet Union\u2019s indisputable military achievement of vanquishing the German fascist regime, instead implying that the US and Britain were the sole victors.\n\nTrump added for vainglorious good measure: \u201cThe American spirit will always win. In the end, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d\n\nThis outrageous falsification of history takes American absurdity to a whole new exceptional level. There has always been a cloying tendency in US popular culture to overstate the role played by America in defeating Nazi Germany. Hollywood films like \u2018Saving Private Ryan\u2019 are unbearable to watch for their vanity and self-regarding Americanism.\n\nBut for Trump and his White House to openly claim it was Britain and America that won World War Two without even mentioning the colossal sacrifice of the Soviet Union, really takes the distortion and denial of reality into unchartered territory.\n\nFor three years, 1941-44, the Soviet Red Army fought the Nazi Wehrmacht single-handedly. The British and American opening of the Western front with their Normandy landings in June 1944 came as the Nazi regime was crumbling from sustained Soviet counter-offensive and epic battles. Six million Nazi troops were killed in the Eastern Front, compared with one million on the Western Front. The Red Army defeated the elite SS divisions paving the way for the Soviet routing of Hitler\u2019s bunker \u2013 the Third Reich\u2019s last stand \u2013 in Berlin.\n\nAs many as 27 million Soviet citizens died in the heroic war against Nazi Germany, including up to eight million Red Army soldiers. By contrast, the Americans and British each lost less than half a million troops.\n\nTrump\u2019s contemptible ignorance is matched by his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who also used the 75th anniversary to distort the liberation of Europe by the Red Army from Nazi Germany as supposedly leading to a tyrannical occupation by Soviet communism in the postwar decades.\n\nThis kind of delusional thinking is not just risible and repugnant. It has practical consequences which can be ruinous. For if the Trump administration can be so disconnected from reality, then its policy choices on other matters will be likewise absurd and dangerous.\n\nTake the administration\u2019s policy of blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and his officials are accusing China for \u201ccovering up\u201d and even inflicting the virus on the US. This \u201clogic\u201d is based on fantastic, unscientific myths, which is creating a dangerous slippery-slope towards confrontation.\n\nBy pushing China for financial reparations over Covid-19 deaths and economic damage in the US, Trump is in denial over his administration\u2019s abject failings to contend with the epidemic. But so desperate is Trump\u2019s denial of reality, he is talking up an anti-China rationale that inevitably could lead to war.\n\nThe same goes for America\u2019s chances of successful recovery from the pandemic. Trump is goading his nation to reopen the economy pretending that it is safe to do so without adequate testing and protections. Of course, this president views complex public health issues through the grubby lens of making financial profit.\n\nWhile he is urging his country to reopen \u2013 in the pretense that the \u201cAmerican spirit will always win\u201d \u2013 Trump is ignoring the reality that his own White House has become a hotspot for Covid-19 infection. Three of the administration\u2019s top health experts are in quarantine due to infection fears. Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly self-isolating after his press secretary tested positive for the disease. A valet to Trump has also been infected.\n\nKevin Hassett, an economic advisor to Trump, told US media at the weekend that the White House West Wing has become a \u201cscary place to work\u201d \u2013 such is the increasing risk of administration staffers succumbing to COVID-19.\n\nTrump has previously likened the fight against the disease to a war. He incessantly congratulates himself for handling the epidemic which last week he compared to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThis president is a walking contradiction from his own delusions and absurdities. He may be right about the \u201cRussiagate\" nonsense and a lot of the \u201cfake news\u201d US corporate news media. We can give him credit on that score. But if Trump can\u2019t even acknowledge the fundamental facts about World War Two and in particular the decisive role played by the Soviet Union, then we should know that his administration is doomed to further failure, specifically in relations with China and in mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":769,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/11\/21254928\/timuel-black-spanish-flu-coronavirus-covid-19-chicago-history-older-american-senior-citizens","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-11","author":[],"title":"I was born in the year of the Spanish Flu \u2014 and I\u2019m not ready to leave in the year of COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/7yg0qO-FopUm4_ILRaFCYHVi6jE=\/0x0:2400x1257\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/16156058\/timuel_black_gesture_2_horiz.jpg","body_text":"The coronavirus pandemic is taking a heavy toll on black people, especially the oldest among us. But quite a few intelligent young people are not taking the virus seriously. They continue to go out and gather in large groups. It\u2019s a serious threat to their well-being and that of their families and friends.\n\nI\u2019m not here to scold, but I hope my experience can help you young people consider why we need to take serious precautions to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.\n\nI was born during the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918. My sister died in the epidemic. I doubt my mother ever recovered from that loss. Yet, my mother went on, living another half-century despite health problems, the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nOpinion\n\nMother was just one generation removed from slavery. In 1919, she and my father moved the family from Alabama to Chicago to escape Jim Crow and racist terror. All three of her surviving children became well-educated. My brother and I fought in the U.S. Army in World War II and became decorated veterans.\n\nBattles are not won in weeks\n\nNow we\u2019re going to have to fight this pandemic as hard as we fought back then. The president has claimed the virus will magically disappear any day now. In reality, no historic battle is won in a few days or weeks. It\u2019s a good thing he wasn\u2019t president during World War II or you\u2019d all be speaking German right now, and I wouldn\u2019t be speaking at all.\n\nThey call my age group the Greatest Generation because we fought in World War II. But now, in my old age, I believe you young people will have to be the new Greatest Generation.\n\nI am infuriated by the dismissive attitude of certain politicians towards older Americans. Especially now, as we seniors are threatened by this virus, they act like we are expendable. But we have as much right to be here, living our lives, as anyone else.\n\nMy contemporaries and I have a vast reserve of talent, ideas and positive experiences. We have been change-makers, and we are not done yet. Talk to your own grandparents if you are fortunate enough to have them with you. Ask them what they\u2019ve been through.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to respect your elders. You\u2019ve also got to protect them. Make sure they have what they need, but keep your distance for the time being. Follow the advice of scientists and doctors: Stay home, wash your hands, cover your face, and so on, to prevent spreading the virus. To practice these rules is a form of resistance to historic injustice.\n\nBack in World War II, we made a united effort to defeat our enemies. The future of democracy was at stake. Every family sacrificed. We saved cans to be turned into ammunition. We grew vegetables in every yard. Butter, meat, sugar, coffee and other necessities were rationed to send to the troops overseas. We looked out for each other.\n\nWe united even though we were still segregated inside the Army. We said among ourselves, \u201cWe\u2019ll solve that problem once we get back home.\u201d\n\nProtecting everyone \u2014 and our election\n\nI\u2019m proud of the young people who are now organizing on the South Side, delivering food and supplies to those in need. They are acting with purpose and leadership.\n\nBesides our elders, we must protect those who have been locked up. We on the outside should be demanding protection for them. We\u2019ve got to treat them fairly, and with all due haste, release as many as possible, get them access to healthcare and make sure they are housed.\n\nI worry, too, that the president may seize this opportunity to delay or even prevent the national elections next fall. We need a national system of alternative methods for voting, such as mail-in ballots. I remain optimistic that we can mobilize the electorate and defeat the incumbent.\n\nOur great cause in the days of my youth was the defeat of tyranny worldwide. It took an international effort. Every young person came forward. We did it then and we can defeat this enemy today.\n\nAt 101, I\u2019ve been lucky to live beyond the typical lifespan. I hope we can inspire each other, and stay politically alert and active.\n\nIn the words of my favorite old spiritual hymn: \u201cI\u2019m so glad\/Trouble don\u2019t last always.\u201d\n\nTimuel D.

But Democrats say the plan, dubbed the Heroes Act, details the priorities they believe need to be addressed as the economic and public health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic worsen.\n\nThe more than 1,800-page bill marks a long wish list for Democrats, including nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments and another round of direct cash payments to Americans. It extends unemployment benefits to January, adds hazard pay for front-line workers and expands virus-testing efforts.\n\n\"We must think big for the people now, because if we don't, it will cost more in lives and livelihood later,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday. \"Not acting is the most expensive course. We are presenting a plan to do what is necessary to deal with the [coronavirus] crisis and make sure we can get the country back to work and school safely.\"\n\nDemocrats are viewing the legislation as a critical marker of what they see as gaps left by the previous roughly $3 trillion in spending that has already been enacted in the last two months. Bipartisan talks to reach a deal on a fifth relief bill haven't gotten off the ground as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says it's time first to evaluate how the previous packages are working. He is also insisting that any new bill include liability protections for businesses and individuals, a move Democrats oppose.\n\nThe chamber's leaders were also quick to slam the Democrats' plan on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is nothing more than a messaging exercise from House Democrats,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. \"It is an effort to try and create talking points for the 2020 election. It's not going anywhere, and we know that.\"\n\nAmong its provisions, the Democratic proposal provides $200 billion to essential workers in pandemic hazard pay. It also adds another $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment efforts.\n\nMany Democrats, including House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark, D-Mass., say the coronavirus crisis has exposed significant systemic shortcomings in the way the federal government supports workers and families.\n\n\"The coronavirus pandemic has exposed gaping holes in our social safety net,\" Clark said in an interview. \"It has brought into stark relief issues that we knew were there but now we can see their devastating impacts so clearly.\"\n\nClark is advocating for new child care funding and programs to make it easier for families, and women in particular, to return to work as schools and child care facilities remain closed. Democrats say it will be difficult to restart the economy without some intervention to keep businesses afloat and to allow workers to return safely to their jobs.\n\nSome moderate Democrats are wary about approving another large spending bill but have been largely willing to support the additional spending as long as it is closely tailored to the coronavirus response, according to aides familiar with the talks. Most Democrats are referring to the legislation as a follow-up to the CARES Act, which was approved in March, but it is not seen as the final action that Congress will have to take in response to the coronavirus.\n\nThe new legislative proposal, released Tuesday, provides large sums for some of Democrats' top priorities, including $500 billion in direct, flexible aid for state governments and an additional $357 billion for local governments and counties. Many Senate Republicans have criticized the push for more state aid, arguing that any new money needs to be tied to the pandemic and not help address budget issues that predated the crisis.\n\nDemocrats set aside $3.6 billion to protect federal elections, $25 billion to support the U.S. Postal Service, $100 billion for low-income rent support, $75 billion for a homeowner assistance fund and $100 million for the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs.\n\nThe bill includes some changes to programs that were approved in the CARES Act, including an expansion of the IRS payment program. Democrats want more generous benefits for families, including a $1,200 payment for each dependent. The CARES Act limits payments to $500 per child; adults or other dependents do not currently qualify. The bill provides up to $6,000 per household.\n\nIt also expands funding for small-business loans, enhances an employee-retention tax credit program and boosts worker protections.\n\nRepublicans have already rejected many elements of the bill, including a suspension of the cap on the state and local tax deduction that was approved as part of the 2017 GOP-led tax cuts.\n\nDemocrats also want to extend emergency family and medical leave until the end of 2021. Doing so is part of their broader focus on child care and family support. The official scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the earlier version of the leave provisions, which passed in March and extend through the end of this year, would themselves cost $105 billion. The latest proposal would more than double the length of those benefits.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., on Tuesday highlighted the funding for safe elections.\n\nThe plan \"is a further response to this unprecedented challenge to our people, to our health and to our economic well-being,\" Hoyer said.\n\nThe House is also planning to vote separately on Friday on a Democratic plan that would allow some members to vote by proxy when they are unable to return to the Capitol because of the health crisis. The proposal also sets up procedures for lawmakers to participate in hearings remotely.\n\nThe House Rules Committee is slated to take up the funding bill, as well as the remote voting and hearings bill, on Thursday to ready the measures for Friday's floor action.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":800,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/study-finds-most-develop-antibodies-covid-19\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":[],"title":"Study Finds Most Develop Antibodies To COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_341456667.jpeg","body_text":"Chongqing Medical University China has found that nearly everyone who recovers from COVID-19 will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the patients were found to have had the immune cells within three weeks.\n\nAccording to the recent research nearly everyone who becomes infected with this virus and goes on to recover will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the 285 patients developed both types of immune cells that fight this virus.\n\nGlobally antibody testing is being geared up in an attempt to see who has already had the virus and was able to develop some potential form of natural protection against reinfection from COVID-19. However, many questions remain around these antibodies such as whether everyone will develop them, what level is necessary to confer protection, and just how long the protection if any will last.\n\nThis study was designed to help answer one of those question and it \u201cbrings much-needed clarity, along with renewed enthusiasm, to efforts to develop and implement widescale antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2,\u201d wrote Dr Francis Collins on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Director's blog.\n\nBy this point just about everyone has heard about antibodies and knows that they are immune cells that the body develops in a unique response to a given pathogen, and if you have never had exposure to a virus or bacterium you will not develop antibodies to it. In response to most infections the body will start producing these specialized cells that will recognize and target an infection should it occur again, often it will neutralize the pathogen entirely.\n\nCoronaviruses are much like those that cause the common cold, from what is known about other coronaviruses scientists are guessing that humans will develop antibodies against this novel version. Up until recently there was no knowing for sure until they were able to study patients.\n\nIn this study the blood of 258 patients was monitored for signs of immune cells; humans produce two types of antibodies Igm and IgG. The first is produced early after infection and these IgM antibodies provide a short burst of protection before fading away; 40% of the patients had produced IgM antibodies within the first week of infection, and after two weeks of observation 95% had developed detectable levels of IgM and were producing IgG antibodies that take longer to develop but have more potential for long term protection.\n\nIn a follow up study blood was collected from another 69 patients, and within 20 days all but two patients produced antibodies; those two patients were a related mother and daughter.\n\nTo determine how much protection these antibodies carry and for how long they confer immunity scientists will need to continue to study patients and follow them, perhaps even doing challenge experiments to expose them to the virus again to see if their antibodies will protect them from reinfections.\n\nHowever, until enough time has passed for such studies to be completed these studies are indeed an encouraging sign that the human body is able to learn and develop defenses against COVID-19 after exposure. If this turns out to be the case humanity may be able to develop some form of herd immunity against COVID-19 that would help to keep possible future cases of this virus from reaching epidemic levels as are currently being experienced on a global scale.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a way to go with both virus and antibody testing for COVID-19,\u201d wrote Dr Collins. \u201cBut as this study and others begin to piece together the complex puzzle of antibody-mediated immunity, it will be possible to learn more about the human body\u2019s response to SARS-CoV-2 and home in on our goal of achieving safe, effective, and sustained protection against this devastating disease.\u201d","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":804,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/05\/12\/852376351\/there-was-so-little-information-polio-survivors-offer-pandemic-perspective","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":"['Apoorva Mittal']","title":"'There Was So Little Information': Polio Survivors Offer Pandemic Perspective","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/05\/12\/pinkney_3_wide-c3e76e9f1657091b6756e782768f3e11b38d1447.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"'There Was So Little Information': Polio Survivors Offer Pandemic Perspective\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Erick Williams, George Theoharis, Takashi Yagihashi Erick Williams, George Theoharis, Takashi Yagihashi\n\nA fear of the unknown. The need to maintain an appropriate distance. An urgent desire to find a cure or vaccine.\n\nThey're the hallmarks of the coronavirus pandemic, but they also characterized an earlier epidemic: when paralysis-causing polio ravaged the U.S. in the 1940s and '50s.\n\nNow, the toddlers and preteens of that era are once again part of a high-risk group during a deadly epidemic of a highly infectious disease.\n\nCommonly transmitted person to person, polio led to social distancing even without official enforcement. People avoided public places and those infected were shunned.\n\nIna Pinkney was a year old when she contracted the disease in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\n\"When my parents would take me out ... you could hear everybody get silent and move away, which is very much what it feels like now,\" says Pinkney, who is 77 now and lives in Chicago, where she ran a successful restaurant for decades.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ina Pinkney Ina Pinkney\n\nMuch like the coronavirus, when one person contracted polio, the entire family lived in anxiety of household spread. That was the case when Nancy Artinian Theoharis became sick more than six decades ago at age 14.\n\nHer daughter Liz remembers stories about her grandmother's efforts to protect the other children in the house, particularly her aunt, who shared a bedroom with Nancy.\n\n\"My grandma would furiously take my aunt's temperature every day,\" Liz Theoharis says. \"While everybody may have been exposed, there was fear that my aunt will come down with the virus as well.\"\n\nAs news reports of the coronavirus spread in the U.S. worsened, Margaret Nielsen started feeling a sense of deja vu, recalling memories of battling polio as a 4-year-old.\n\nAt the time, people stricken with the disease like Nielsen could spend weeks isolated in the hospital.\n\nThe 78-year-retired professor remembers how little the doctors knew about the disease, and how hard it was for her family to get updates on how she was doing.\n\n\"They could call once a day and they would get a one-word response because there were so many families calling,\" says Nielsen, who lives in East Lansing, Mich. \"So during the initial couple of weeks when I was infectious there was so little information.\"\n\nInfectious cases peaked in the 1950s, with nearly 60,000 contracting the disease and more than 3,000 deaths in 1952 alone.\n\nPeople felt a great sense of urgency about when a vaccine would be found, says Carl Kurlander, whose documentary A Shot Felt 'Round the World chronicled the discovery of the first preventative polio vaccine.\n\nDr. Jonas Salk began work on a live virus vaccine in 1947. And in 1955, a safe and effective vaccine became available to the public.\n\n\"Church bell rang out, people screamed and were let out of school,\" Kurlander says. \"Around the world there were headlines 'Victory Over Polio.'\"\n\nNow, riding through another epidemic, Pinkney says that a coronavirus vaccine may not instantly reverse things to normalcy but \"there will be a great sense of relief.\"\n\nAnd surviving that earlier epidemic has given her perspective: \"I live with hope and I live with anticipation that we will [get] on the other side of this. I don't know what it looks like. It doesn't even matter, as long as people are not getting sick and people are not dying.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":805,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/well\/2020\/5\/12\/21255857\/oprah-winfrey-virtual-wellness-experience-weight-watchers-coronavirus-pandemic","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":[],"title":"Oprah Winfrey launching live virtual wellness experience during pandemic","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/OLHtZ1CKCJiCiNRBKYGJkVAO3hw=\/0x101:3000x1672\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19962497\/AP20123033433119.jpg","body_text":"NEW YORK \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, who visited arenas last year on a wellness tour, is bringing the idea to living rooms while people are homebound due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe media mogul on Tuesday announced \u201cOprah\u2019s Your Life in Focus: A Vision Forward \u2014 Live Virtual Experience,\u201d a free and interactive four-week event that is an extension of her wellness tour with WW (Weight Watchers Reimagined).

The first phase focuses on employees who are unable to do their jobs from home or who are \u201cfacing challenges working from home,\u201d reports Bloomberg. This will likely include employees who work on the company\u2019s hardware products, and some employees who are part of this phase have apparently already started working at Apple\u2019s offices again. More employees will return to Apple\u2019s offices in a second phase of the plan that\u2019s scheduled to start in July.\n\nEmployees are scheduled to return in two phases\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what changes Apple may make in its offices to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as improving ventilation. But some employees asked to return may only have to be in the office for certain amounts of time, according to Bloomberg, and CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees in April that temperature checks and social distancing would likely be implemented when employees return.\n\nSome other major tech companies are not asking employees to return to offices as quickly as Apple is. Both Google and Facebook will allow most employees to work from home through the rest of the year, Amazon will let employees work from home until \u201cat least\u201d October 2nd, and Twitter is letting employees work from home indefinitely as of Tuesday.\n\nApple also plans to open some of its retail stores after closing all of them outside of China on March 14th.

Watch the CBS News special, \"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line:\" Friday, May 15, at 9 p.m. ET\/PT on CBS, re-airing Saturday and Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on CBSN.\n\n\"Rapid response Northwest 6. Rapid response Northwest 6. Blue zone.\"\n\nDr. Michelle Ng Gong oversees a rapid response team of critical care doctors responding to a crashing COVID-19 patient. Gilad Thaler\n\nDr. Michelle Ng Gong strapped on a face shield as the sound of the Montefiore Medical Center PA system broadcasted an all-too-familiar announcement: a COVID-19 patient was in critical condition. Gong rushed out of the command center, weaved through the hallways, and dodged stretchers as she made her way toward the patient's room.\n\nBefore entering the room, Gong called for gowns, grabbed several herself and handed them out to other nurses who had just arrived. Gong was about to enter the \"red zone,\" an area where personal protective gear, or PPE, would be the only barrier between her and the virus.\n\nThe patient was on a ventilator, but his oxygen levels had fallen. Gong didn't believe he was moving his chest wall well. She wanted to attempt taking the ventilator out of the equation and manually deliver oxygen. She reached for the patient's foot.\n\n\"He's got good blood pressure, he's got a good pulse.\" Gong leaped onto the patient's chest \u2014 her feet dangled in the air, her face mere inches from the patient's, as she exerted her own body weight. Gong wanted to see if the patient could stand being placed in a \"prone position\" \u2014 a process that requires several healthcare workers to rotate the patient onto the patient's stomach to help get oxygen to the back of the lungs.\n\nGong determined that the patient would benefit from this process, but he would first need to be transmitted to the Surgical ICU.\n\nCOVID-19 patient is transported to the Surgical ICU at Montefiore Medical Center. Gilad Thaler\n\nIn normal times, gowns are discarded each time a nurse or doctor interacts with a patient to minimize contamination in \"green zones\" of the hospital. But this patient needed to get to the surgical ICU immediately.\n\n\"Please clear all corridors,\" a voice said over the PA system.\n\nBecause he had just been removed from a ventilator, there was a greater chance he would spread COVID-19 into the air. A doctor placed a translucent sheet of plastic over the patient's face, a technique used to minimize spreading the virus, and a team of four remained clad in full PPE while they wheeled the patient across multiple hallways and down an elevator bank.\n\nNurses and doctors in the surgical ICU prepare to put a COVID-19 patient in a prone position. Gilad Thaler\n\nWhile hospitalizations have gone down across New York, the patients who have been admitted are getting sicker.\n\nSaid Gong: \"These are still not normal times, and these are still very sick patients.\" Despite her best efforts, this patient died later that night.\n\nDr. Mary Badillo's PPE suit labeled \"Dr Love\" gets cleaned after a shift. Gilad Thaler\n\nNurse Jasmine Christakos says she will always remember the first COVID-19 death in the Surgical ICU. Christakos had just gotten married in late February and returned to work as the virus was beginning to spread rapidly.\n\nChristakos recalled a family grieving over the fact that they could not visit, and that the patient would die alone. Christakos remembers that night, when the entire unit sat in front of the patient's room and waited for the ventilator to be pulled. \"We said a prayer, we said goodbye, and we told the family, no, they didn't die alone. They died with us.\"\n\nNurse Jasmine Christakos attends to a ventilated patient inside Montefiore Medical Center's surgical ICU. Gilad Thaler\n\nMany of the patients admitted to the Surgical ICU make it out. When a patient is well enough to breathe on their own, they are \"extubated,\" or removed from a ventilator, offering cause for celebration from doctors and nurses.\n\n\"Since COVID, it's been a little difficult to find the light in the darkness. But you celebrate the little victories,\" Christakos told CBS News.\n\nWhile witnessing the extubation of one patient, Doctor Jen-Ting (Tina) Chen called for a nurse to ring a cowbell, signaling the good news to the rest of the floor. After an extubation a few days earlier on the same floor, a nurse wrote the time on a white-board, and drew a heart.\n\nA nurse attends to a COVID-19 patient breathing on their own after being extubated from a ventilator. Gilad Thaler\n\nAt the peak of the pandemic, Montefiore Hospital Center broadcasted \"Empire State of Mind\" by Alicia Keys over the PA system and Christakos has taken to dancing during the \"happy code.\"\n\n\"It's an amazing experience to see someone no longer need a breathing tube. No longer need the help of a ventilator,\" Christakos said. \"I've seen patients where I was like, 'Oh my goodness are they going to make it?' And they do.\" To Christakos, it is victories like these that make the work, \"so worth it, just absolutely worth it.\"\n\nNurse Jasmine Christakos, Montefiore Medical Center Gilad Thaler\n\nCristian Camas is one of many examples of a patient pulling through. The 22-year-old ambulance worker contracted the virus on the job. After 21 days inside Montefiore Medical Center, he was discharged. Nurses wheeled Camas through the COVID ward and out to the street. Camas squinted in the bright light of the sun as healthcare workers applauded his release.\n\nCristian Camas awaits to be discharged after spending 21 days inside Montefiore Medical Center. Gilad Thaler\n\n\"We're definitely winning more than we are losing. The majority of patients with COVID are still surviving. But the sheer number of patients with COVID is just unprecedented,\" said Gong. \"The emergencies continue, we continue to respond, and we take it one day at a time.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":810,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/05\/12\/magazine\/didier-raoult-hydroxychloroquine.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":"['Scott Sayare']","title":"He Was a Science Star.

Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions \u2014 that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. \u201cHubris,\u201d Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, \u201cis the most common thing in the world.\u201d It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. \u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it is a terrible thing to be wrong.\u201d\nRaoult, who founded and directs the research hospital known as the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, or IHU, has made a great career assailing orthodoxy, in both word and practice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I like more than blowing up a theory that\u2019s been so nicely established,\u201d he once said. He has a reputation for bluster but also for a certain creativity. He looks where no one else cares to, with methods no one else is using, and finds things. In just the past 10 years, he has helped identify nearly 500 novel species of human-borne bacteria, about one-fifth of all those named and described. Until recently, he was perhaps best known as the discoverer of the first giant virus, a microbe that, in his opinion, suggests that viruses ought to be considered a fourth and separate domain of living things. The discovery helped win him the Grand Prix Inserm, one of France\u2019s top scientific prizes. It also led him to believe that the tree of life suggested by Darwinian evolution is \u201centirely false,\u201d he told me, and that Darwin himself \u201cwrote nothing but inanities.\u201d He detests consensus and comity; he believes that science, and life, ought to be a fight.\nIt is in this spirit that, over the objections of his peers, and no doubt because of them, too, he has promoted a combination of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and azithromycin, a common antibiotic, as a remedy for Covid-19. He has taken to declaring, \u201cWe know how to cure the disease.\u201d Trump was not the only one eager to embrace this possibility. By the time I arrived in Marseille, some version of Raoult\u2019s treatment regimen had been authorized for testing or use in France, Italy, China, India and numerous other countries. One in every five registered drug trials in the world was testing hydroxychloroquine.\nIn March, Raoult announced that his hospital would test and treat anyone who cared to show up. Crowds gathered at the entrance to the IHU in winding single-file lines, like pilgrims shuffling toward their private audience with the oracle. On March 16, Raoult released the results of a small clinical trial that showed, he said, a 100 percent cure rate. The study has since been widely debated, and Raoult\u2019s boosterism has been lamented by scientists and health officials around the world; in a comment more or less representative of the tenor of the controversy in France, where Raoult\u2019s name and image have now been everywhere for weeks, one detractor, a generally thoughtful politician, suggested that Raoult \u201cshut his face and be a doctor\u201d and that he \u201cstop saying \u2018I\u2019m a genius\u2019 all over the place.\u201d\nHis colleagues liken his psychology to that of Napoleon, though he is not physically small. When asked by one journalist about his tendency to \u201cswim against the current\u201d of scientific thought, Raoult responded: \u201cI\u2019m not an \u2018outsider.\u2019 I\u2019m the one who\u2019s farthest out in front.\u201d Axel Kahn, a geneticist and physician who has known Raoult for nearly 40 years, told me that he has always been this way. \u201cOne of Professor Raoult\u2019s abiding characteristics is that he knows that he\u2019s very good,\u201d Kahn told me. \u201cBut he considers everyone else to be worthless. And he always has. It\u2019s not a recent development.\u201d At his home, alongside a collection of Roman busts, he is said to keep a marble statue of himself.\nRaoult, who is 68, is a sturdily built but fine-featured man, with high cheekbones and a tight, contemptuous mouth. In recent years, he has hidden these behind a straggly white mustache and goatee and has grown his flaxen hair down to his shoulders. On his right pinkie he now wears a silver skull. In internet memes, he has been depicted as the wizard Gandalf and as a druid; except for his white lab coat, he has the general aspect of a fortuneteller who rides a Harley to work. The French journalist Herv\u00e9 Vaudoit, who has written admiringly about Raoult over the years, once asked him why he\u2019d taken to dressing this way. Raoult replied, \u201cBecause it pisses them off.\u201d\nIn the weeks since SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spread throughout the world, his disdain for respectable opinion, and for the \u201cParisian marquesses\u201d who are its representatives, has endeared him to a large segment of the French population. According to one survey, by late March, Raoult had become one of France\u2019s most popular \u201cpolitical personalities,\u201d with particular appeal on the populist extremes. Votives bearing his image were being sold in Marseille, and on some evenings, at 8 p.m., a battalion of municipal garbage trucks assembled on the roadway outside his hospital, where the drivers leaned on their horns in loud and furious tribute. A hundred-foot banner, painted by a club of local soccer fans and strung up near the entrance, read, \u201cMarseille and the world behind Prof. Raoult!!!\u201d\nRaoult has been collecting the merchandise created by his fans, and he seems to be enjoying his fame, though he claims otherwise. He is certain the drugs will vindicate him in the end; everything else is a matter of appearances. \u201cI really do think we\u2019re in a theater,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn my play, the people who judge me as a doctor are my patients. As a scientist, it\u2019s my colleagues. And time.\u201d\nA few weeks ago, I spoke, from the recommended distance, to a man named Jacques Cohen. He was seated on the sidewalk outside the IHU, an angular monument of concrete and glass about a mile and a half from Marseille\u2019s old port. Cohen had his back against a pylon and his wrists on his knees, at the edge of a group of perhaps 60 people. By their unworried proximity to one another \u2014 they were standing around in a loose group, as people used to, waiting to enter the hospital through a side door \u2014 they were identifiable as the unfortunates who already knew they were positive. I had selected Cohen as my interlocutor under the guidance of a nearby nurse. He was not coughing or sneezing; he wore a mask. \u201cIn any case, we\u2019re all going to get it,\u201d the nurse said.\nI crouched on the pavement and asked Cohen, who is 76, how he was feeling. For the past two days, he had been taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. \u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d Cohen said through his mask. He looked ashen but optimistic. His fever had fallen, and he had begun to regain his sense of taste. I noted that there was some debate about the efficacy of the treatment. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018believing\u2019 or \u2018not believing,\u2019\u201d Cohen replied. \u201cWe know it\u2019s effective!\u201d\nHydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are well characterized, well tolerated and widely prescribed medications. Azithromycin was developed 40 years ago in the former Yugoslavia and is today the second-most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Hydroxychloroquine, along with its more toxic analog chloroquine, was for several decades the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug in the world. Today it is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. All three molecules are included on the World Health Organization\u2019s Model List of Essential Medicines, a compilation of \u201cthe most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions.\u201d\nRaoult knows the drugs well. From the start of his career, he has experimented extensively with drug repositioning, in which medicines that have been approved for use against one disease are repurposed as treatments for others. Hundreds and hundreds of molecules have already been approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration. Hidden among these, Raoult contends, are various unanticipated cures. \u201cYou test everything,\u201d Raoult told me. \u201cYou stop pondering; you just look and see if, by chance, something works. And what you find by chance, it\u2019ll knock you on your derri\u00e8re.\u201d Antidepressants and antihypertensives have been shown to have antiviral properties; lovastatin, which is prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, has been found to be effective, at least in mice, against plague. In a 2018 paper, Raoult and a team of researchers reported that azithromycin showed strong activity in cells infected with the Zika virus.\nRaoult spent the first decade of his life in Dakar, in what was then French Senegal, where his father, a military doctor, was posted. To ward off malaria, he was given chloroquine. \u201cI took it all the time when I was a kid,\u201d he told me. In the 1990s, in an early repurposing experiment, he tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine on a frequently fatal condition known as Q fever, which is caused by an intracellular bacterium. Like viruses, intracellular bacteria multiply within the cells of their hosts; Raoult found that hydroxychloroquine, by reducing acidity within the host cells, slowed bacterial growth. He began treating Q fever with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline and later used the same drugs for Whipple\u2019s disease, another fatal condition caused by an intracellular bacterium. The combination is now considered to be a standard treatment for both diseases.\nGiven the similarities between intracellular bacteria and viruses, Raoult suspected that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have antiviral effects. Following the SARS outbreak in 2002, researchers found that chloroquine slowed reproduction of the SARS coronavirus in cell cultures. Raoult reviewed that evidence in a 2007 paper, concluding that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might be \u201can interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.\u201d This winter, as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 began to take on the contours of a pandemic, he surveyed the data that had begun coming out of China. An early report on chloroquine showed good results in vitro. In mid-February, another Chinese team reported that, in more than 100 patients, it had been found to have \u201cpotent activity against Covid-19.\u201d Raoult was elated.\nAt the time, health authorities around the world were warning that a viable treatment could be months away. The Chinese reports, however, appeared to confirm Raoult\u2019s longstanding hopes for chloroquine. A deadly virus for which no treatment existed could evidently be stopped by an inexpensive, widely studied, pre-existing molecule, and one that Raoult knew well. A more heedful scientist might have surveyed the Chinese data and begun preparations for tests of his own. Raoult did this, but he also posted a brief, jubilant video on YouTube, under the title \u201cCoronavirus: Game Over!\u201d Chloroquine had produced what he called \u201cspectacular improvements\u201d in the Chinese patients. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent news \u2014 this is probably the easiest respiratory infection to treat of all,\u201d Raoult said. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll tell you is, be careful: Soon the pharmacies won\u2019t have any chloroquine left!\u201d\nRaoult has spent nearly his entire life in Marseille, a famously ragged and combative city, which he loves. He named a genus of bacteria, Massilia, for it and has given its name or the names of its neighborhoods to numerous other species of microbe. Marseille has been a major port for more than 2,000 years and has a correspondingly rich history of disease. It was the point of entry into France for all three of the great waves of bubonic plague, beginning in the sixth century. Between 1720 and 1722, the plague killed about half of Marseille\u2019s population; one of its central neighborhoods, on the old port, is today named for the bishop who tended to the ill while the city\u2019s doctors hid in fear.\nRaoult wrote his first research paper, in 1979, on a tick-borne infection sometimes known as Marseille fever. The disease was also called \u201cbenign summer fever,\u201d and more than 50 years of science said it was nonlethal. And yet one of the 41 patients in his data set had died. Before submitting the paper, Raoult, who was then a young resident, gave it to a supervising professor for review. \u201cAnd he takes it,\u201d Raoult told me, \u201che doesn\u2019t show it to me again, and he publishes it \u2014 and he\u2019d taken out the death. Because he didn\u2019t know how to make sense of the death.\u201d Raoult was disgusted, and the incident shaped his philosophy of scientific inquiry. \u201cI learned that the people who wanted to follow the familiar path were prepared to cheat in order to do it,\u201d he said. In subsequent work, he demonstrated that Marseille fever was indeed fatal in almost precisely one in every 41 cases. \u201cHe was a \u2018follower,\u2019\u201d Raoult said of the professor. \u201cAnd these \u2018followers\u2019 are all cheaters. That\u2019s what I thought. And it\u2019s still what I think.\u201d\nHe is, fundamentally, a contrarian. In Raoult\u2019s view, little of consequence has been accomplished by researchers who endorse the habitual tools and theories of their age. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life being \u2018against,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cI tell young scientists: \u2018You know, you don\u2019t need a brain to agree. All you need is a spinal cord.\u2019\u201d He is thrilled by conflict. It is a matter both of philosophy \u2014 the influence, no doubt, of the thinker he refers to admiringly as \u201cmaster Nietzsche\u201d \u2014 and of temperament. \u201cHe loves to know that things are roiling around him,\u201d one of his lab technicians told me; he sets off storms and admires them as they roll out over the land. His peers shake their heads at this behavior but grant him a grudging respect. \u201cYou can\u2019t knock him down,\u201d said Mark Pallen, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of East Anglia. \u201cIn terms of his place in the canon, the sainthood of science, he\u2019s pretty secure there.\u201d\nHe is also interested in power and has been attentive to it from the start. In 1985 and 1986, Raoult worked at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., where he discovered the Science Citation Index. The index, a tool that can be used to measure a scientist\u2019s influence on the basis of his or her publication history, was relatively unknown in France. Raoult looked up the researchers reputed to be the best in Marseille. \u201cIt was really the emperor wears no clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t publish. There was one who hadn\u2019t written a paper in 10 years.\u201d In Raoult\u2019s view, French science was a duchy of appearances, connections and self-reverence. \u201cIt was people saying\u201d \u2014 he mimed the drone of an aristocrat \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018Oh, him, yes, he\u2019s very good.\u2019 And this reputation, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s based on, but it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d\nFor decades, Raoult has boasted of his prodigious rates of publication and citation, which, as objective statistics, he considers to be the best measure of his worth as a researcher. Biomedical researchers in France write or contribute to perhaps 10 scientific papers every year and a few hundred in the course of a career. Raoult\u2019s name sits atop several thousand; in each of the past eight years, he has produced more than 100. In 2020, he has already published at least 54.\nRaoult is reputed to be an indefatigable worker, but he also achieves his extreme rate of publication by attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute. Though the practice is not unheard-of, it is unusual. \u201cEven to just read those papers would take up a large percentage of anyone\u2019s time,\u201d Pallen told me. \u201cFor someone like me to actually go through them carefully, critique them, make a substantial intellectual contribution \u2014 I think that would be practically impossible.\u201d\nWith few exceptions, the department heads at the IHU have worked under Raoult for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. It is an \u201cancestral system,\u201d \u201cfamilial\u201d and \u201cclanlike,\u201d said Michel Drancourt, a clinician who is Raoult\u2019s longest-serving collaborator. Raoult is, without question, the patriarch, and he is in some respects reputed to be benevolent. The IHU spends a great deal of money on scholarships and research grants for students from the developing world, for instance, and Raoult is known to be accessible to young researchers in a way that distinguishes him from other high-powered scientists. He is also known for berating his subordinates. While visiting the IHU, I watched a young researcher emerge from Raoult\u2019s office in tears and rush into the arms of her friends, who were evidently accustomed to this. \u201cWhen he\u2019s not happy about something, he\u2019ll let you know,\u201d one of them told me. A 2017 employee letter of complaint, which was followed by an investigation of the IHU, described the \u201cscreaming,\u201d \u201cinsults\u201d and \u201cpsychological bullying\u201d of a \u201cleadership of another era.\u201d Along the entryway to Raoult\u2019s institute, there\u2019s a line from Horace: Exegi monumentum aere perennius, \u201cI have crafted a monument more lasting than bronze.\u201d\nIn recent years, Raoult has amused himself, it seems, by staking out tendentious scientific claims, sometimes in territories that are well beyond the scope of his expertise. He is skeptical, for instance, of the utility of mathematical modeling in the realm of epidemiology. The same logic has led him to conclude that climate modelers are no more than \u201csoothsayers\u201d for our \u201cscientistic era\u201d and that their dire predictions are mostly just an attempt to expiate our intense but irrational feelings of guilt.\nHe is also dismissive of the alarmism that is the default position among specialists of infectious disease. He doubted, initially, that SARS-CoV-2 would spread beyond China, or that it might be a terrible problem if it did. On Jan. 20, Chinese scientists confirmed that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient, and President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments about the coronavirus, declared that all possible measures would have to be taken to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization announced an emergency meeting. The following day, in Marseille, Raoult posted a video to his institute\u2019s YouTube channel. He faced his offscreen interviewer with weary eyes, sighed and said, \u201cYou know, the world has gone crazy.\u201d Every year, he said, there are probably 600 or 700 people who die from coronavirus infections in France and thousands more from other respiratory illnesses. \u201cThe fact that people have died from a coronavirus in China, I don\u2019t feel like it means much of anything for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe people don\u2019t have anything to do, so they\u2019ve gone looking in China for something to be scared about.\u201d\nRaoult\u2019s most recent book, \u201cEpidemics: Real Dangers and False Alerts,\u201d was published in late March, by which time the W.H.O. had reported more than 330,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and more than 14,500 deaths. \u201cThis anguish over epidemics,\u201d he writes, \u201cis completely untethered from the reality of deaths from infectious diseases.\u201d\nBy the standards of molecular biology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, the technology most commonly used to test for SARS-CoV-2, is not extravagantly complex. But it depends upon collection swabs, thermocycling machines, chemical reagents and nucleotide probes and primers, and if any one of these components is in insufficient supply, the tests cannot be run. Beginning in January, when the SARS-CoV-2 genome was first published, the IHU bought or borrowed as much of all these as possible, spending a half million euros on new machines alone. Whatever Raoult\u2019s reservations about the virus, he did not intend to miss the opportunity to study it, and perhaps to win the race to find a treatment. His institute receives most of its funding from public sources \u2014 Raoult was given 130 million euros to build it \u2014 but it effectively controls its own budget, and Raoult, as the founding director, has near-complete control of what goes on inside its walls. \u201cHe can essentially say, \u2018Hold on, I want to turn the bedroom and the dining room into a kitchen,\u2019\u201d Drancourt said.\nNearly 800 people work at the institute. In early March, as coronavirus patients began arriving, almost all the staff members turned their efforts to SARS-CoV-2. Raoult obtained authorization to begin a small clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine. Because viral respiratory infections often lead to secondary bacterial infections, however, Raoult wanted to test a supplementary antibiotic in some patients; he chose azithromycin, which he had previously tested against Zika. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to choose one, you might as well choose one that\u2019s been shown to be active against a virus,\u201d said Bernard La Scola, who runs the biosafety lab at the IHU.\nHydroxychloroquine is believed to inhibit viral reproduction in infected cells by raising their pH, as in Q fever and Whipple\u2019s disease; the antiviral mechanism of azithromycin has not been explained. But what works works. If we relied only upon medications with precisely established mechanisms, a number of popular drugs \u2014 acetaminophen, for instance, the active ingredient in Tylenol \u2014 would not be in use. I asked Raoult if the idea to test the drugs together had emerged from discussions with his team. \u201cIt was me,\u201d he told me. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself.\u201d\nTesting had been scheduled to run for two weeks per patient, but after only six days, the results were so favorable that Raoult decided to end the trial and publish. \u201cUsually, we\u2019d take time to write, to make corrections, to consider, to go over things 50 times,\u201d said Philippe Gautret, the department head who was the first listed author on the paper. \u201cIn this case, we were working with a sense of real urgency. Because we thought we had to get the word out, because, maybe, we\u2019d found a way to make things better.\u201d\nOthers might have proceeded with more caution or perhaps waited to confirm these results with a larger, more rigorous trial. Raoult likes to think of himself as a doctor first, however, with a moral obligation to treat his patients that supersedes any desire to produce reliable data. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell someone, \u2018Listen, today\u2019s not your lucky day, you\u2019re getting the placebo, you\u2019re going to be dying,\u2019\u201d he told me. He believes it to be unnecessary, in addition to being unethical, to run randomized controlled trials, or R.C.T.s, of treatments for deadly infectious diseases. If these have become the accepted standard in biomedical research, Raoult contends, it is only because they appeal to statisticians \u201cwho have never seen a patient.\u201d He refers to these scientists disdainfully as \u201cmethodologists.\u201d\nRaoult\u2019s paper included results for 36 patients. Fourteen were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate; six were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and azithromycin; and 16 served as controls. On Day 6 of the trial, 14 of the 16 control patients still tested positive for the virus. Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine fared markedly better, with only six of 14 testing positive on Day 6. Most encouraging, though, all six patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were found to be rid of the virus.\nSeveral prominent French doctors cautioned that the results would have to be confirmed and warned of possible side effects. The French health minister deemed the trial promising but called for more testing. Raoult had already begun assembling data for a larger study, but he dismissed the need for anything particularly vast or lengthy. Like other critics of the R.C.T., he likes to point out that a number of self-evidently useful developments in the realm of human health have never been validated by such rigorous tests. This observation has come to be known as the parachute paradigm: We tend to accept the claim that parachutes reduce injury among people who leap from airplanes, but this effect has never been proved in a randomized study that compares an experimental parachute group to an unlucky parachuteless control. \u201cIt\u2019s like Didier says,\u201d Drancourt told me. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have something that\u2019s visible in 10 patients, or 30, it\u2019s useless. It\u2019s not of any consequence.\u201d An effective treatment for a potentially lethal infectious disease will be visible to the naked eye.\nOn March 16, a Long Island attorney and blockchain enthusiast named Gregory Rigano appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s nightly show on Fox News, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d Ingraham introduced the segment by asking: \u201cWhat if there\u2019s already a cheap and widely available medication, that\u2019s on the market, to treat the virus? Well, according to a new study, there is such a drug. It\u2019s called chloroquine.\u201d Rigano, who at the time was falsely presenting himself as an adviser to Stanford Medical School, had recently self-published an acclamatory report on the potential of chloroquine, \u201cAn Effective Treatment for Coronavirus (Covid-19),\u201d as a Google Doc formatted to resemble a scientific publication. It had begun to circulate in right-wing media and also in Silicon Valley; Elon Musk tweeted a link to it. Raoult saw it and noticed the attention it was receiving online. Another researcher might have found this sort of publication irresponsible and dangerous. Raoult began corresponding with Rigano and his co-author, James Todaro, an ophthalmologist and Bitcoin investor. Raoult authorized them to share his results before they had been published.\nOn air, Rigano announced that a researcher in the south of France, \u201cone of the most eminent infectious-disease specialists in the whole world,\u201d was about to publish the results of a major clinical study. \u201cWithin a matter of six days, the patients taking hydroxychloroquine tested negative for coronavirus, for Covid-19,\u201d Rigano said. (He made no mention of azithromycin.) \u201cWe have a strong reason to believe that a preventative dose of hydroxychloroquine is going to prevent the virus from attaching to the body, and just get rid of it completely,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a game changer,\u201d Ingraham said.\nIn the coming days, Ingraham questioned both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Trump\u2019s pandemic task force, and Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, about the drug. Sean Hannity began promoting it as a cure for Covid-19. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d he said on his radio show. \u201cIf I had it \u2014 personally, I am speaking only for Sean Hannity \u2014 I would be all over this.\u201d Rigano appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show and claimed that Raoult\u2019s study had shown hydroxychloroquine to have a \u201c100 percent cure rate against coronavirus.\u201d According to Todaro, Raoult had sent him a copy of his study and allowed him to post it on Twitter that day, two days before the preprint release. \u201cI suspect he gave us permission because he knew it was the fastest way to disseminate the trial results,\u201d Todaro told me. (Rigano did not respond to requests for comment.) Later, Raoult himself appeared on \u201cDr. Oz,\u201d the talk show hosted by the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a frequent Fox News guest who has promoted hydroxychloroquine. \u201cI believe that ideas and theories are epidemic,\u201d Raoult once wrote. \u201cWhen they\u2019re good, they take root.\u201d\nTrump began hyping hydroxychloroquine on March 19, at a White House news conference with his coronavirus task force. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very exciting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it could be a game changer and maybe not. And maybe not. But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful.\u201d He suggested, inaccurately, that the F.D.A. had approved the drug for use against Covid-19. He made no mention of azithromycin. Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn of the F.D.A. gently corrected him later and said that a large clinical trial would be the appropriate way to evaluate the therapeutic value of the drug.\nStill, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are available for use in other conditions, doctors were able to provide Covid-19 patients with \u201coff-label\u201d treatment if they believed it would provide a benefit. Shortages of the drugs were reported beginning in mid-March. The F.D.A., under what appears to have been strong pressure from the Trump administration, issued an emergency-use authorization for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, giving doctors access to tens of millions of doses of the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile. Unusually, the C.D.C., at what was reportedly Trump\u2019s direct urging, issued Covid-19 prescription guidelines for the drugs based upon unattributed clinical anecdotes. (The guidelines were later withdrawn.) A top government biomedical official was removed from his post, he has claimed, for having resisted political pressure to fund \u201cpotentially dangerous drugs,\u201d including hydroxychloroquine.\nThere is much about Raoult that might make him, and by extension his proposed treatment, appealing to a man like Trump. He is an iconoclast with funny hair; he thinks almost everyone else is stupid, especially those who are typically regarded as smart; he is beloved by the angry and conspiracy-minded; his self-congratulation is more or less unceasing. Raoult and I spoke several days after the emergency-use authorization was signed. He said he hadn\u2019t heard about it and seemed surprised, but he also said that Trump had impressed him with his intuition on hydroxychloroquine. \u201cHe\u2019s not so dumb,\u201d he said, laughing. Raoult classified Trump\u2019s psychology as that of an \u201centrepreneur,\u201d by way of contrast with that of a \u201cpolitician.\u201d \u201cEntrepreneurs are people who know how to decide, who know how to take risks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at a certain point, to decide is to take a risk. Every decision is a risk.\u201d\nThe French waited far too long, in his estimation, to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients. The authorization came only after Raoult announced in the press that he would continue, \u201cin accordance with the Hippocratic oath\u201d and effectively in defiance of the government, to treat patients with his combination therapy. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that in the end, everyone will be using this treatment,\u201d Raoult told Le Parisien. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before people agree to eat their hats.\u201d\nThe dynamics of a crisis are not especially conducive to reliable science. In October 1985, in the terrible early years of the AIDS epidemic, a group of French doctors, joined by the French minister of social affairs, held a news conference to announce to the world that they had discovered what looked like a cure. The drug was cyclosporine, an inexpensive immunosuppressant that had until then been used in organ transplants to prevent the rejection of new tissue. In AIDS patients, cyclosporine had the paradoxical effect of increasing white-blood-cell counts; patients underwent a \u201cspectacular improvement,\u201d one researcher said. The announcement was based upon results from only two patients, however, and these patients had begun treatment only one week earlier. The scientists were widely criticized at the time for flouting the norms of biomedical research to report such limited data. \u201cGiven the strength of our hypotheses,\u201d they responded, \u201cwe believe that, ethically, we could not continue to keep our results a secret just to respect the usual laws of scientific conduct.\u201d\n\u201cLike Raoult, they felt very strongly about what they said,\u201d said Jean-Michel Molina, who directs the infectious-disease departments at two public hospitals in Paris. \u201cThey felt that they had found a cure.\u201d Shortly after the announcement, one of the two patients died, and it was revealed that a third patient had died before the news conference; he had been excluded from the reported results because his case was considered too grave to reverse. Within weeks, the remaining patient\u2019s white-blood-cell count had fallen to its previous level. Experimentation with cyclosporine soon stopped.\nLike many doctors, Molina viewed Raoult\u2019s study with skepticism, but he was also curious to see if his proposed treatment regimen might in fact work. He tested hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 of his own patients. \u201cWe had severe patients, and we wanted to try something,\u201d Molina told me. Within five days, one had died, and two others had been transferred out of his service to intensive care. In another patient, the treatment was suspended after the onset of cardiac issues, a known side effect of the drugs. Eight of the 10 surviving patients still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the conclusion of the study period. Raoult\u2019s data had come from patients with mild or early cases of the disease, when viral loads are lower, and I asked Molina if his patients had not been too sick to benefit from the treatment. \u201cIf there is antiviral activity, you should be able to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, you may say, \u2018It\u2019s too late, you\u2019re not going to see the clinical benefit.\u2019 But at least you should see the antiviral activity. If it\u2019s an antiviral.\u201d\nRaoult\u2019s study had measured only viral load. It offered no data on clinical outcomes, and it was not clear if the patients\u2019 actual symptoms had improved or indeed whether the patients lived or died. At the outset, 26 patients were assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine, six more than the 20 who appeared in the final results. The six additional patients had been \u201clost in follow-up,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cbecause of early cessation of treatment.\u201d The reasons given were concerning. One patient stopped taking the drug after developing nausea. Three patients had to be transferred out of the institute to intensive care. One patient died. (Another patient elected to leave the hospital before the end of the treatment cycle.) \u201cSo four of the 26 treated patients were actually not recovering at all,\u201d noted Elisabeth Bik, a scientific consultant who wrote a widely circulated blog post on Raoult\u2019s study. She paraphrased the sarcasm circulating on Twitter: \u201cMy results always look amazing if I leave out the patients who died.\u201d\nThe report was also riddled with discrepancies and apparent errors. Its selection criteria called for participants above the age of 12, but three of the control subjects were younger than this. The control patients were drawn not only from the IHU but also from hospitals in two other cities, where the standard of care and the testing protocols may have differed. Fourteen of 16 control patients were reported to have tested positive for the virus at the conclusion of the study on Day 6. In fact, according to the initial report, for five of those 14, no data was collected that day. One of the six patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and was recorded as \u201cvirologically cured\u201d at Day 6 was found, in the end, to be carrying the virus two days later.\nThis apparent sloppiness was unsurprising to many of those who have tracked Raoult\u2019s work in the past. A prominent French microbiologist told me that, in terms of publication, Raoult\u2019s reputation among scientists has been \u201clong gone\u201d for some time. \u201cIn private,\u201d the researcher wrote to me, \u201ceverybody agrees on the low reliability\/reproducibility of most of the papers coming out of his lab.\u201d (He asked to speak anonymously so as not to anger Raoult, whom he knows.) In 2018, after damning evaluations, Raoult\u2019s principal laboratory groups were stripped of their association with two of France\u2019s top public research institutions. Raoult was found to have produced an extraordinary number of publications but few of great quality. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to publish [expletive] when you know how publishing works,\u201d said Karine Lacombe, a professor of medicine in Paris who has recently been among Raoult\u2019s more outspoken critics.\nBeyond its apparent errors and omissions, the study\u2019s design \u2014 its small size, its flawed control, the unrandomized assignment of patients to the treatment and control groups \u2014 was widely viewed to render its results meaningless. Fauci repeatedly called its results \u201canecdotal\u201d; the biostatistician who analyzed the paper on behalf of the French government\u2019s coronavirus advisory committee wrote that it was \u201cimpossible to interpret the effect described therein as being attributable to treatment with hydroxychloroquine.\u201d\nLarge, well-controlled randomized trials are by no means the only way to arrive at useful scientific insights. Their utility is that they enhance statistical signals such that, amid the noise of human variability and random chance, even the faint effect of some new treatment can be detected. The prime statistical hurdle that any proposed treatment for Covid-19 will have to overcome \u2014 one that is delicate for even Raoult\u2019s critics to make note of, amid the sorrow and fear of this pandemic \u2014 is that the signal is likely to be very faint, because the disease is, in the end, rarely fatal. Nearly everyone survives; an effective treatment will save the life of the one or so patients in every hundred who would not have lived without it. \u201cYou know, people sometimes say, \u2018If the patient gets better, that\u2019s because of the drug, and if they get worse, it\u2019s because of the virus,\u2019\u201d Molina told me. \u201cAnd of course that\u2019s not true. And that\u2019s why you need to do a well-conducted, randomized, placebo-controlled study if you want to show anything.\u201d It is possible that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are an effective treatment for Covid-19. But Raoult\u2019s study showed, at best, that 20 people who would almost certainly have survived without any treatment at all also survived for six days while taking the drugs Raoult prescribed.\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t done this stuff, you can look at a report of people responding to such a treatment and \ufb01gure that the answer is here \u2014 right here, and anyone who doesn\u2019t see it must have some ulterior motives,\u201d Derek Lowe, a longtime pharmaceutical researcher, wrote for Science Translational Medicine last month. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d He went on: \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s drugs, obesity drugs, cardiovascular drugs, osteoporosis drugs: Over and over, there have been what looked like positive results that evaporated on closer inspection. After you\u2019ve experienced this a few times, you take the lesson to heart that the only way to be sure about these things is to run suf\ufb01ciently powered controlled trials. No shortcuts, no gut feelings \u2014 just data.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve invented 10 or so treatments in my life,\u201d Raoult told me. \u201cHalf of them are prescribed all over the world. I\u2019ve never done a double-blind study in my life, never. Never! Never done anything randomized, either.\u201d He noted, with some satisfaction, that the criticism was more intense than he had anticipated. \u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t have imagined that it would set off a frenzy like this,\u201d he said, leaning back in his office chair and gesturing at the storm he had created in the world outside. \u201cWhen you tell the story, it\u2019s extremely straightforward, no? It\u2019s subject, verb, complement: You detect a disease; there\u2019s a drug that\u2019s cheap, whose safety we know all about because there\u2019s two billion people who take it; we prescribe it, and it changes what it changes. It might not be a miracle product, but it\u2019s better than doing nothing, no?\u201d\nHis subordinates defended the study as the best work they could do under the circumstances and the fastest way to alert the world to the possibility of a treatment. The use of off-site controls was not ideal, for example, but it was the only option if they wanted to move fast. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a methodological weakness,\u201d Gautret, the first author, told me. \u201cBut we made do with what we had.\u201d As for the six patients \u201clost in follow-up,\u201d even if it had been possible to collect data from them, it would have been nonsensical to include most of them in their report. Their aim was \u201cto treat people in the early stages of the disease, when it\u2019s not yet serious,\u201d Gautret said. \u201cWe know that in acute viral diseases, the earlier you treat, the better your chances of success. It makes no sense to include people who are at the edge of death in the study. We\u2019re not claiming to be able to treat people who are nearly dead.\u201d Another small study, in 80 patients, likewise showed better results for patients with mild forms of the disease.\nIn Marseille, Raoult told me he would be releasing a third study, this one of 1,000 patients, the following week. Initial results were published in mid-April. Raoult had treated 1,061 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The study was neither controlled nor randomized; at the time of the preprint release, eight patients had died, and five remained hospitalized, while 46 in total experienced a \u201cpoor clinical outcome.\u201d The findings were summarized as \u201c98.7 percent of patients cured so far.\u201d The therapy constituted a \u201csafe and efficient treatment for Covid-19,\u201d the authors wrote.\nOther scientists disagreed with this characterization of the results. \u201cThe cure rate is almost identical to what\u2019s been described about the natural course of the disease,\u201d the virologist Christine Rouzioux told French radio. Lacombe called Raoult\u2019s conclusions \u201cmagical thinking,\u201d adding: \u201cI very honestly think he hasn\u2019t shown anything at all.\u201d It was soon discovered, too, that the second and third studies had been conducted without approval from a state ethics board. In an initial version of the third paper, Raoult wrote that he had conducted a \u201cretrospective study on a cohort of patients receiving standard treatment following a research protocol previously registered.\u201d He provided a reference to the protocol that had been approved for the first trial. But that protocol included hydroxychloroquine alone and not azithromycin; Raoult never received approval to systematically test a combination of the drugs.\nThe French medical regulatory agency, the A.N.S.M., sent Raoult a request for evidence of the second study\u2019s \u201clegal status\u201d in mid-April. Later in the month, the French Medical Council issued a statement, widely assumed to be directed at Raoult, reminding its members that \u201cthe endangerment of patients\u201d by exposure to \u201ctreatments that have not been scientifically validated\u201d could be cause for immediate suspension. Raoult responded on Twitter, where he now has a half million followers, that the council\u2019s threat was \u201cobviously\u201d not applicable to his case. In a statement on the A.N.S.M.\u2019s inquiry, the IHU insisted that the study did not involve experimentation because \u201cno procedure beyond the standard of care\u201d \u2014 which, at the IHU, was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin \u2014 had been employed.\nRaoult had by then begun to lose his composure. He accused Lacombe of being a shill for the pharmaceutical industry; his fans sent her death threats. On Twitter, he called Bik, the consultant who wrote critically about the first study, a \u201cwitch hunter\u201d and called a study that she tweeted \u2014 one of several published in April and May that seemed to suggest that Raoult\u2019s treatment regimen was ineffectual or even harmful \u2014 \u201cfake news.\u201d The authors of another such study were accused of \u201cscientific fraud.\u201d \u201cMy detractors are children!\u201d Raoult told an interviewer. The world\u2019s attention has drifted to new studies of other drugs; Raoult has taken to attacking those studies for their methodological weaknesses.\nThe results of his initial trial have yet to be replicated. \u201cI think what he secretly hopes is that no one will ever be able to show anything,\u201d Molina told me. \u201cThat all the trials conducted on hydroxychloroquine will not be able to even reach a conclusion of no efficacy.\u201d In recent weeks, Raoult has in fact tempered his claims about the virtues of his treatment regimen. The published, peer-reviewed version of the final study noted that another two patients had died, bringing the total to 10. Where the earlier version called the drugs \u201csafe and efficient,\u201d they were now described merely as \u201csafe.\u201d\nHe has shown flickers of what appears to be doubt. In one interview, Raoult quoted Camus, from the fatalistic coda of \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d hoping that \u201con the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators, and that they should greet me with howls of hatred.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust popularity,\u201d he told the interviewer. \u201cWhen too many people think you\u2019re wonderful, you should start to wonder.\u201d His initial YouTube video, \u201cCoronavirus: Game Over!\u201d has also been renamed. The new language is more measured, and in place of the exclamation point there now stands a question mark.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":819,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/12\/21254960\/facebook-ai-moderation-covid-19-coronavirus-hateful-memes-hate-speech","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":"['Nick Statt']","title":"How Facebook is using AI to combat COVID-19 misinformation and detect \u2018hateful memes\u2019","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/sYyp1J8vbbDEKHVKEs9uOGYQde4=\/0x292:2040x1360\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/10595581\/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.jpg","body_text":"Facebook on Monday released a new report detailing how it uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human fact-checkers and moderators to enforce its community standards. The report \u2014 called the Community Standards Enforcement Report, which usually encompasses data and findings from the prior three to six months \u2014 has a large focus on AI this time around and the progress Facebook is relying more on software instead of people, given the extreme toll the job can take on human moderators.\n\nFacebook is also relying more on the technology nowadays to help moderate its platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is preventing the company from using its usual third-party moderator firms because those firms\u2019 employees are not allowed to access sensitive Facebook data from home computers. The Verge reported on Tuesday that Facebook has settled a $52 million class action with current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, developed while on the job. The Verge has reported extensively on the working conditions of firms Facebook hires to moderate its platform.\n\nEvery content moderator who worked for Facebook from 2015 until now will get at least $1,000, and is eligible for up to $50,000 in damages.\n\n\n\nIt's a landmark settlement that fully acknowledges the terrible toll that moderation can on the people who do this work \u2014 Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) May 12, 2020\n\nFacebook says the data it\u2019s compiled its most recent report doesn\u2019t contain any larger trends in its enforcement or in offending behavior on its platform because the pandemic hit so late in its reporting period. \u201cThis report includes data only through March 2020 so it does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made during the pandemic,\u201d writes Guy Rosen, the company\u2019s vice president of integrity, in a blog post. \u201cWe anticipate we\u2019ll see the impact of those changes in our next report, and possibly beyond, and we will be transparent about them.\u2019\n\nGiven the state of the world, Facebook\u2019s report does contain new information about how the company is specifically combating coronavirus-related misinformation and other forms of platform abuse, like price gouging on Facebook Marketplace, using its AI tools.\n\nFacebook put warning labels on 50 million coronavirus-related posts last month\n\n\u201cDuring the month of April, we put warning labels on about 50 million posts related to COVID-19 on Facebook, based on around 7,500 articles by our independent fact-checking partners,\u201d the company said in a separate blog post, penned by a group of its research scientists and software engineers, about its ongoing COVID-19 misinformation efforts published today. \u201cSince March 1st, we\u2019ve removed more than 2.5 million pieces of content for the sale of masks, hand sanitizers, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits. But these are difficult challenges, and our tools are far from perfect. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of these challenges means the work will never be done.\u201d\n\nFacebook says its labels are working: 95 percent of the time, someone who is warned that a piece of content contains misinformation will decide not to view it anyway. But producing those labels across its enormous platform is proving to be a challenge. For one, Facebook is discovering that a fair amount of misinformation as well as hate speech is now showing up in images and videos, not just text or article links.\n\n\u201cWe have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos,\u201d the company says in a separate hate speech-specific blog post about its recent moderation findings and research. \u201cAs with other content, hate speech also can be multimodal: A meme might use text and image together to attack a particular group of people, for example.\u201d\n\nThis is a tougher challenge for AI to tackle, the company admits. Not only do AI-trained models have a harder time parsing a meme image or a video due to complexities like wordplay and language differences, but that software must also then be trained to find duplicates or only marginally modified versions of that content as it spreads across Facebook. But this is precisely what Facebook says it\u2019s achieved with what it calls SimSearchNet, a multiyear effort across many divisions within the company to train an AI model how to recognize both copies of the original image and those that are near-duplicates and have perhaps one word in the line of text changed.\n\n\u201cWe have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce independent fact-checkers have determined that an image contains misleading or false claims about coronavirus, SimSearchNet, as part of our end-to-end image indexing and matching system, is able to recognize near-duplicate matches so we can apply warning labels,\u201d the company says. \u201cThis system runs on every image uploaded to Instagram and Facebook and checks against task-specific human-curated databases. This accounts for billions of images being checked per day, including against databases set up to detect COVID-19 misinformation.\u201d\n\nFacebook uses the example of a misleading image modeled after a broadcast news graphic with a line of overlaid text reading, \u201cCOVID-19 is found in toilet paper.\u201d The image is from a known peddler of fake news called Now8News, and the graphic has since been debunked by Snopes and other fact-checking organizations. But Facebook says it had to train its AI to differentiate between the original image and a modified one that says, \u201cCOVID-19 isn\u2019t found in toilet paper.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to help reduce the spread of duplicate images while also not inadvertently labeling genuine posts or those that don\u2019t meet the bar for misinformation. This is a big problem on Facebook where many politically motivated pages and organizations or those that simply feed off partisan outrage will take photographs, screenshots, and other images and alter them to change their meaning. An AI model that knows the difference and can label one as misinformation and the other as genuine is a meaningful step forward, especially when it can then do the same to any duplicate or near-duplicate content in the future without roping in non-offending images in the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that these similarity systems be as accurate as possible, because a mistake can mean taking action on content that doesn\u2019t actually violate our policies,\u201d the company says. \u201cThis is particularly important because for each piece of misinformation fact-checker identifies, there may be thousands or millions of copies. Using AI to detect these matches also enables our fact-checking partners to focus on catching new instances of misinformation rather than near-identical variations of content they\u2019ve already seen.\u201d\n\nFacebook has also improved its hate speech moderation using many of the same techniques it\u2019s employing toward coronavirus-related content. \u201cAI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove, up from 80.2 percent the previous quarter,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2020, we took action on 9.6 million pieces of content for violating our hate speech policies \u2014 an increase of 3.9 million.\u201d\n\nFacebook is able to rely more on AI, thanks to some advancements in how its models understand and parse text, both as it appears in posts and accompanying links and as overlaid in images or video.\n\n\u201cAI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople sharing hate speech often try to elude detection by modifying their content. This sort of adversarial behavior ranges from intentionally misspelling words or avoiding certain phrases to modifying images and videos,\u201d the company says. \u201cAs we improve our systems to address these challenges, it\u2019s crucial to get it right. Mistakenly classifying content as hate speech can mean preventing people from expressing themselves and engaging with others.\u201d Facebook says so-called counterspeech, or a response to hate speech that argues against it but nonetheless usually contains snippets of the offensive content, is \u201cparticularly challenging to classify correctly because it can look so similar to the hate speech itself.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s latest report includes more data from Instagram, including how much bullying content that platform removes and how much of the content is appealed and reinstated. It applied its image-matching efforts toward finding suicide and self-injury posts, raising the percentage of Instagram content that was removed before users reported it.\n\nSuicide and self-injury enforcement on Facebook also expanded in the last quarter of 2019, when the company removed 5 million pieces of content \u2014 double the amount it had removed in the months before. A spokesperson says this spike stemmed from a change that let Facebook detect and remove lots of very old content in October and November, and the numbers dropped dramatically in 2020 as it shifted its focus back to newer material.\n\nFacebook says its new advances \u2014 in particular, a neural network it calls XLM-R announced last November \u2014 are helping its automated moderation systems better understand text across multiple languages. Facebook says XLM-R allows it \u201cto train efficiently on orders of magnitude more data and for a longer amount of time,\u201d and to transfer that learning across multiple languages.\n\nBut Facebook says memes are proving to be a resilient and hard-to-detect delivery mechanism for hate speech, even with its improved tools. So it built a dedicated \u201chateful meme\u201d data set containing 10,000 examples, where the meaning of the image can only be fully understood by processing both the image and the text and understanding the relationship between the two.\n\nAn example is an image of a barren desert with the text, \u201cLook how many people love you,\u201d overlaid on top. Facebook calls the process of detecting this with automated systems multimodal understanding, and training its AI models with this level of sophistication is part of its more cutting-edge moderation research.\n\n\u201cTo provide researchers with a data set with clear licensing terms, we licensed assets from Getty Images. We worked with trained third-party annotators to create new memes similar to existing ones that had been shared on social media sites,\u201d the company says. \u201cThe annotators used Getty Images\u2019 collection of stock images to replace the original visuals while still preserving the semantic content.\u201d\n\nFacebook says it\u2019s providing the data set to researchers to improve techniques for detecting this type of hate speech online. It\u2019s also launching a challenge with a $100,000 prize for researchers to create models trained on the data set that can successfully parse these more subtle forms of speech that Facebook is seeing more often now that its systems are more proactively taking down more blatant hateful content.\n\nUpdate May 12th, 3:55PM ET: Added information about Facebook\u2019s $52 million settlement with third-party contract moderators.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":822,"url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2020\/05\/fired-zoom-layoffs-coronavirus\/611509\/","publisher":"The Atlantic","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":"['Deborah Copaken']","title":"I Got Fired Over Zoom","image":"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/cUV6DYW5gaVwlBVLQO-65HCOlTU=\/0x43:2000x1085\/960x500\/media\/img\/mt\/2020\/05\/zoomfired_1\/original.jpg","body_text":"I was born in 1966. I shouldn\u2019t admit this, because age discrimination for older women searching for work, as I now am, is real. This makes me, at 54, one of the oldest of the Gen Xers. Like many in my generation, I have spent the past 32 years hopping over the Frogger logs of an unforgiving gig economy. The sociologist Allison Pugh has dubbed this the \u201ctumbleweed society,\u201d in which \u201cjob insecurity is rampant and widely seen as inevitable.\u201d If COVID-19 can be said to have any upsides, it is that its devastating economic ravages have finally unmasked the truth of late-stage American capitalism: It is a system in which every worker is as expendable as every shareholder is sacrosanct.\n\nAt 3 p.m., having regained my composure, I clicked on the Zoom link. A Doom link, I thought, as my image appeared vertically between the CEO\u2019s and our head of HR\u2019s.

Her eyes watered anew. She had made this same call several times over the course of that day: seven times out of a staff of 44, so a 16 percent reduction in headcount. Many of us let go that day were among the higher earners, meaning our loss would allow more runway for the company than if they\u2019d dismissed those earning less. In the end, with venture-capital belts tightening and deals falling through left and right because of the virus, the company\u2019s survival was all about runway.

I had to keep reminding myself of this fact. Plus I was being offered the chance to keep working on a contract basis, with reduced hours, so I am in better shape than most. \u201cWhen this pandemic is over, do you imagine me coming back as a full-time employee?\u201d I asked.\n\nAbsolutely, my boss said. Her pained expression was hurting me. In fact, being fired over Zoom, without the normal visual cues and eye contact of in-person communication, only magnified the surreality of the moment. I found the whole experience of managing the disembodied pain of others emotionally draining. \u201cZoom fatigue,\u201d it\u2019s been dubbed, this simulacrum of human interaction in which we\u2019re all now living.

I always worry about them. Basically, we are their family,\u201d he said.\n\nThe so-called \u201cstay in place\u201d approach requires workers to cut themselves off physically from the community, almost as if they were working on an oil well at sea.\n\nThe idea is that the coronavirus cases plaguing nursing homes and other group living arrangements usually are brought into those settings by asymptomatic staff members who do not realize they are carrying the virus.\n\nBy reducing the number of people going in and out of a building, officials at Trinity hoped to limit the potential exposure to residents.\n\nIt appears to have worked. Only six individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 with just one death across Trinity\u2019s 100 facilities housing 650 clients.\n\nNobody has become sick at the Joliet intermediate care facility where Journigans has spent the past month caring for its 14 residents.\n\nFifty-one of Trinity\u2019s 100 homes, including all eight in Chicago, are using the stay-in-place staffing system.\n\nOther Illinois service providers to the developmentally disabled have adopted similar approaches after learning about Trinity\u2019s efforts, said Thane Dykstra, chief executive officer of the non-profit organization.\n\nDykstra said staying in place has worked well for residents but has been difficult for employees.\n\n\u201cI think people are glad when they come out. It\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, some struggled with missing family events such as Easter and Mother\u2019s Day. Another couldn\u2019t be there when a family member died.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been challenging for folks, but a lot of them understand the value and the difference they\u2019ve made for our program participants,\u201d Dykstra said.\n\nJournigans and his co-workers are known as \u201cdirect support professionals\u201d or DSPs, a notoriously low-paid line of work involving some of society\u2019s most dedicated caregivers.\n\nAs I have written previously, caregivers in these settings don\u2019t have the luxury of social distancing. In many cases, they have to help residents eat, bathe and dress. They also have to prepare the food and clean.\n\nStarting pay is $10.10 an hour. The state reimburses providers such as Trinity at $13 an hour. The low pay rate is a constant problem because it makes it difficult to recruit and retain workers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost so many fabulous workers, and the only reason they left was because of money,\u201d said Journigans, who is president of his AFSCME local union.\n\nSince shutting himself in at the Joliet facilty, Journigans said he\u2019s worked 16 to 17 hours a day on average, which means he\u2019s piling up 80 to 90 hours of overtime per week \u2014 at time and a half. Employees are not paid for the time they are sleeping. He\u2019ll receive a $2,000 bonus for completing the 30 days \u2014 and another $2,000 when he finishes the additional 15 days.\n\nDykstra said Trinity is able to temporarily afford the bonuses because the state is continuing to pay for the day program the agency normally provides but can\u2019t during the shutdown. Given the staff shortages, overtime costs are always present, he said.\n\nResidents of the Joliet home have been diagnosed with Down syndrome, autism and other developmental disabilities. They range in age from 29 to 65.\n\nAll are mobile, although some are in wheelchairs. Not everyone speaks, but \u201cmost understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Journigans said.\n\nJournigans came to this line of work as a young man after being laid off from a factory job and found that it changed him for the better, teaching both patience and empathy.\n\nHe takes his sense of accomplishment in the small things, such as teaching a 60-year-old man how to tie his own shoes for the first time.\n\nWhen this pandemic is behind us, it would be shameful if we failed to better compensate those who make this commitment.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":832,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/columnists\/2020\/5\/12\/21254722\/nursing-homes-coronavirus-deaths-covid-19-phil-kadner","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":"['Phil Kadner']","title":"We hear the cry in nursing homes \u2014 \u2018Help me!\u2019 \u2014 yet we turn away","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/2weni5Fdc0f_Tvaoou80hs8--yA=\/0x105:920x587\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19961432\/Annotation_2020_05_08_212738.0.jpg","body_text":"As a young man, I stumbled out of an elevator onto the \u201cHelp me!\u201d floor.\n\nAn ancient woman, whose pleadings will haunt me to my death, sat in a hallway in a wheelchair endlessly shouting, \u201cHelp me! Help me!\u201d with her arms outstretched.\n\nI ran to the nursing station nearby, where many people were busily working but ignoring the patient in need. \u201cThat woman needs help,\u201d I barked.\n\nA nurse, nurse\u2019s assistant, attendant or someone in a uniform whose rank I could not identify slowly turned their head toward me from the paperwork they were working on at the time.\n\nColumnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\n\u201cShe does not need help,\u201d this person said very firmly. \u201cThat is just what she does.\u201d\n\nI was convinced that this nursing home employee was a wretched person, as were they all. No feeling individual could turn a deaf ear to such cries of anguish. I walked over to the woman myself and said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d the tiny woman cried. \u201cHelp me!\u201d There was no further explanation.\n\nYears passed. I grew older. Visited many nursing homes. And eventually placed my father in one.\n\nAnd one day, that tough old man, that World War II veteran, that survivor of the Great Depression, who as far as I know never asked anything from anyone, was sitting in his wheelchair in a hallway shouting, \u201cHelp me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, Dad?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with searching eyes and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI came to the conclusion that he wanted out. Out of his predicament. Not just out of the nursing home, that wretched place where people wait for the end, but out of his body and out of the muddle that perplexed his mind.\n\nIt is a terrible place to be. To live or to work. To even think about.\n\nI suppose that is why so many of us refuse to visit long-term care facilities, even before COVID-19 struck, before there was a quarantine.\n\nI would visit my father every day. But I was usually alone. That didn\u2019t make me better than other people. It did make me a little more mentally unstable during that time, I suspect.\n\nIt is said that for most states, a third of COVID-19 deaths are in long-term care facilities. In 14 states, more than half of the virus deaths are in such places.\n\nPolitical leaders must do something to help our elderly, shriek those with grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, in such places.\n\nAnd political leaders themselves shout that something must be done.\n\nYet, we know what these places are. We always have.\n\nThey are underfunded. Inspections are haphazard. They are often money factories. They are far too often warehouses, storage facilities, for those waiting to die.\n\nThat is not to say we don\u2019t love the people inside. In fact, often we love them too much to see them waste away. It is terrifying to watch such a thing.\n\nAnd so we leave underpaid, overworked and too often uncaring people to deal with the dirty work. We don\u2019t want to look.\n\nWhat happens when we don\u2019t look is the same thing that always happens when people turn away. Abuse. Neglect. Incompetence.\n\nThere are sometimes angels at work in these places. I have seen them with my own eyes. They care. They pay a personal price I cannot imagine.\n\nBut when I hear howls of righteous indignation on this issue from the public and their representatives, I am reminded of the false outrage that erupts following a mass shooting by people who are mentally ill.\n\nWe are all standing on the \u201cHelp me!\u201d floor listening to the anguished cries.

Gyms are closed nationwide. Sports and most leisure activities are also banned, especially if more than one individual is involved. Even professional athletes find themselves sitting it out on the sidelines.\n\nExercise has countless health benefits, but they do not last long if you stop exercising. In a matter of weeks, you can lose many of the benefits that you worked so hard to obtain. Cardiovascular conditioning, muscle strength, and flexibility all start to decline when you stop moving and hit the couch. This happens more rapidly in middle-aged and older individuals. So how can you maintain or improve your fitness level during this challenging time?\n\nWe live in a time when large segments of the population are either very active and fit, or they are sedentary. So how, during this pandemic, can fit people stay fit? And how can sedentary people get more active?\n\nIf you are fit and active, you must find creative ways to remain so. It may involve trying new things. For cardiovascular fitness, activities like running, cycling, and taking brisk walks are fine, as long as you maintain social distancing. Home strength workouts can be done with calisthenics, free weights, and exercise bands to maintain muscular strength. A stability ball can be used to improve core strength and endurance. Stretching can be done easily and should be done daily. Taking up yoga will enhance flexibility and also help with stress management. Many gyms and personal trainers are offering virtual workouts, and there are ample online exercise programs and fitness books that provide valuable guidance and routines.\n\nIf you have been sedentary, this downtime may be a great opportunity to get more active and improve your health. According to the Surgeon General\u2019s Report on Physical Activity and Health, being sedentary is as dangerous as smoking a pack of cigarettes per day. So get off the couch, take a walk, do some yard work or gardening. If you have medical issues, always check with your physician to see if you can safely start to exercise.\n\nFor both groups\u2014active and sedentary\u2014there are things you can do to lessen the risk of orthopaedic or musculoskeletal issues with exercise. With any new activity, start slowly and follow the \u201c10% rule.\u201d That is, do not increase the intensity or duration of the activity more than 10% per week. This includes the distance you walk or the amount of weight you lift. Always warm up and stretch before activity. Wear appropriate footwear and use proper protective equipment when applicable. Stay well hydrated.\n\nAs COVID-related restrictions are lifted, follow CDC guidelines on resuming your favorite activity or sport. The American Council on Exercise (ACE) offers excellent information on staying active during the pandemic. Also, organizations like the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and the United States Golf Association (USGA) offer more sport-specific guidelines in terms of returning to play during COVID-19.\n\nOne thing is for certain, during normal times or a pandemic, being sedentary is not an option. Find ways to safely keep moving and avoid the body break-down that Dr. Cureton warned about.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":845,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/columnists\/202005131079294351-pichot-resigns-from-world-rugby-council\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":"['Dan', 'Rowell]","title":"Pichot Resigns From World Rugby Council","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107908\/56\/1079085640.jpg","body_text":"Sport is going through some tough times amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with numerous professional competitions having been suspended or called off entirely, but the lack of on-pitch action hasn\u2019t stopped drama from unfolded behind the scenes, particularly in Rugby.\n\nFormer Argentina international Agustin Pichtot has announced that he will be resigning from the World Rugby Council.\n\nThe move comes after he was defeated by Englishman Sir Bill Beaumont in the World Rugby Federation\u2019s leadership election, which took place on the second of May.\n\nIn a statement on the Argentine Rugby Union\u2019s website, Pichot outlined his reasons for doing do.\n\n\"The only reason I have been a part of World Rugby to this day, and which in turn is the same one that has moved me to run for president, is the conviction that World Rugby needs change, but my proposal, which I fervently believe in, has not been chosen, and that is why I choose to step aside, I cannot conceive of occupying a place just for the sake of occupying it,\" Pichot stated.\n\nThe Argentine\u2019s World Rugby Federation leadership bid was based on reforming the game\u2019s governance, which he felt overly favoured traditionally strong teams such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France and England, and hence stymied the development of the sport in other countries.\n\nAmong Pichot\u2019s proposals was the idea to introduce a promotion and relegations system for the Six Nations; Europe\u2019s flagship international Rugby tournament , in order to potentially grant smaller teams in the continent the chance to take on the established titans of the sport.\n\nThe manifesto of Sir Bill Beaumont however, proved to be more popular, as he was largely in favour of maintaining the status quo within Rugby, with his most radical proposal being to allow players from countries such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga to represent their home nations after turning out for bigger sides, in pursuit of international trophies.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Pichot will return to Rugby in another capacity, or if much reform to the sport\u2019s governing bodies will take place, but for now, at least it seems that the World Rugby Federation will plough ahead, and implement the sensible if less radical manifesto of Sir Bill Beaumont.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":847,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/5\/13\/21257366\/fbi-cyber-division-warns-against-chinese-hackers-coronavirus-covid-19-response","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":[],"title":"FBI cyber division warns against Chinese hackers","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/mW5T6w_cpF6fyFrAfXg5QYbNxYY=\/0x0:5631x2948\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19967333\/1212652369.jpg.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s cyber division are warning hackers backed by the Chinese government may be attempting to steal the work of U.S. researchers on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe two agencies issued a public service announcement of the potential threat on Wednesday.

Harris said all tickets will be digital, and visitors will register for a time slot to enter the museum.\n\nAt the entrance, visitors will go to a tented area where nurses will take their temperature. Visitors will be scanned in to enter, and will be required to wear face coverings.\n\nEmployees will wear masks, as well. Hand sanitizer will be available, and museum staff will wipe down surfaces frequently. All touch screens will be covered, and interactive exhibits, such as one where visitors can play musical instruments, will remain closed.\n\nVisitor traffic through the museum will move in one direction. The cafe and gift shop will be open following state guidelines for social distancing.\n\n\u201cWe want to provide an environment that is safe as possible,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris said an infectious disease specialist from the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic will be on site.\n\nThe goal is to operate the museum at about 50% capacity, Harris said. The museum will reopen with shorter hours \u2014 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \u2014 to allow for extra cleaning and disinfecting. Certain hours will be reserved for at-risk populations, including seniors and people with chronic conditions.\n\nHarris said the facility is keeping a close eye on museums in the region and nationwide, and he\u2019s been in contact with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very measured as we start,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWhile digital tickets are not currently available to purchase, Harris said he expects to announce when they\u2019ll go on sale by June 1.\n\nHarris said he hopes to bring back food trucks and beer gardens to the museum\u2019s plaza. Live music will resume, though initially with soloists instead of bands.\n\nThere will also be a day reserved just for medical professionals and emergency personnel who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus response.\n\nSome of the museum\u2019s employees will continue to work remotely, and others who were furloughed will be called back as they\u2019re needed. Harris said he continued to pay for health insurance for the furloughed employees.\n\nAs for the 2020 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, rescheduled for Nov. 7, Harris said no determination has been made about how the event will proceed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding the date,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers, Whitney Houston, Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, The Notorious B.I.G. and T.

He splits his household expenses with his mother, Gertrudes, and his wife, Carmela. Everyone contributes what they can, and there's rarely arguments over who bought what, or who pitched in more or less. \"One thing about the Philippines is that not a lot of people have credit cards,\" he says. \"Even though people there might not have as much money, they really don't have debt.

In the E.R. \"people there are pretty tough. And we have to be because we see a lot of things.\" It helps, he says, that he is eligible for overtime pay. Navarro earned around $90,000 pre-tax last year with overtime. In the first few weeks of the outbreak, he worked 12-hour shifts, four-to-five days per week. Recently, though, he's scaled back his time to his regular schedule of three, 12-hour days per week at the behest of his mother and wife, who worry about his exposure to the virus. He estimates he'll make around the same amount this year. Navarro's mother came to the United States from the Philippines in the 1970s, and she was a nurse at the same hospital where her son works. She retired in 2014. One of the big differences between their experiences, he says, is that his mother receives a pension from the hospital, which the family puts toward their bills. Navarro will not receive that when he retires, as it's no longer offered to hospital employees.\n\nGetrudes Navarro finishing nursing school in 1968. Courtesy of Ron Navarro\n\nBut that doesn't bother Navarro. It's a blessing to be able to do what he loves while earning decent money. \"I love nursing, taking care of people,\" he says. \"It's an honor to be helping those in need.\"\n\nLiving and working in Michigan\n\nNavarro lives in the house he grew up in in Troy, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, with Carmela and his mother. He splits many of his monthly expenses with his wife and mother, and the exact breakdown of who pays for what depends on the month. \"It is actually pretty common for Asians, and for Filipinos, to pass down what they have,\" he says.\n\nRon Navarro sits with his wife Carmela and mother in their Troy, Mich., home. CNBC Make It\n\nThough his mother and father had paid off the house before they gave it to their son, Navarro decided to renovate it in 2015. The couple also purchased a condo in the Philippines in 2018, where Carmela grew up and where Navarro lived for four years while he attended nursing school. He feels like rushing the home renovation is not only his biggest financial mistake, but he admits it's the biggest fight he's had about money with Carmela and his mother. He took out a $180,000 mortgage on his house, and used $100,000 for renovations and $80,000 to buy an income property in the Philippines, which he plans to rent out to earn extra money.\n\nThe kitchen renovation. Courtesy of Ron Navarro\n\n\"Sometimes that's how I am. When I want something, I do everything at once,\" he says. In hindsight, he wishes he had padded his emergency fund more instead of spending so much renovating the house, but as the family is still living well within their means, he's giving himself grace for the hasty decision making. Navarro completely remodeled the first floor of the house, ripping out carpet and wood paneling from the 1970s, and adding new appliances to the kitchen. They also updated the landscaping and added a new staircase to the basement. Now, he's in a comfortable spot. With his salary, his wife's income (Carmela works in accounts receivable for Beaumont Health Systems in Detroit) and his mother's pension, the family makes well above the $97,000 median household income for his area.\n\nRon met Carmela's family in the Philippines in 2010. Courtesy of Ron Navarro\n\nThey are also able to send $300 to Carmela's family in the Philippines every month. They have helped send both of her younger siblings to college. Navarro thinks of it as repayment for the help and support the family provided him when he lived in the Philippines for four years. \"I can never pay them back fully,\" he adds. \"Like the saying goes, money doesn't buy happiness, but it sure can help.\"\n\nHow the Navarro family budgets\n\nSo far, the pandemic has done little to change the family's budget. His wife is still working, and Navarro is bringing in more money than usual thanks to overtime.\n\nRon Navarro driving to work at Detroit Receiving Hospital. CNBC Make It\n\nEven before the pandemic, Navarro and his wife spent most of their time at home: Because of his atypical work schedule, they went out once every other weekend at most. \"My wife and I, we don't really buy a lot of stuff,\" he says, aside from travel \u2014 the couple went to Japan last year \u2014 and their two cars, which they hope to pay off in full this summer. The couple put their stimulus relief checks in their emergency fund. Here's the family's estimated monthly spending as of May 2020:\n\nCNBC Make It\n\nSavings: $1,600\n\n$1,600 Housing: $1,515\n\n$1,515 Transportation: $1,232 for car and truck payments, gas\n\n$1,232 for car and truck payments, gas Insurance: $902 for car, dental, health, life\n\n$902 for car, dental, health, life Food: $600\n\n$600 Utilities : $480\n\n: $480 Family support: $300\n\n$300 Phone: $150\n\n$150 Subscriptions: $71 for Amazon Prime, his gym, Netflix, etc. While Navarro is the breadwinner, the three family members split monthly expenses between themselves. His mother helps with groceries, for example, and pays for her own medical expenses. \"We all pitch in in our own ways,\" he says. \"We just all help each other out.\" Navarro personally saves $1,600 per month: $400 goes to his liquid savings account, $700 is invested in his 401(k) and he invests an additional $500 in a Roth IRA. He has $1,400 in savings and nearly $40,000 saved for retirement.\n\nRon and Carmela at their civil wedding service. Courtesy of Ron Navarro\n\nAfter that, his family's biggest expense is housing, including a $50 monthly fee for their condo in the Philippines (the rest of the condo is paid off) and the monthly mortgage payment on their home in Troy. They also pay around $480 per month for cable, Wi-Fi, heat, electricity and other utilities. The family of three spends around $600 on food, mostly on groceries to prepare meals at home.\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nCNBC Make It asked Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of Charles Schwab Foundation and certified financial planner, to comment on what Navarro is doing right with his money and where he could improve.\n\nCarrie Schwab-Pomerantz is the president of Charles Schwab Foundation and a certified financial planner. Courtesy of Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz.\n\nSchwab-Pomerantz is impressed with where Navarro stands now. \"With zero credit card balance, the investment property paid off, and his vehicles almost paid off, Ron is in a great position to secure his financial future,\" she tells CNBC Make It. Contributing to both a 401(k) and Roth IRA is a great way to have diversified income streams in retirement, she says. He should keep that up as long as he can. And while he's saving a not-insignificant portion of his salary now, she says increasing the \"buffer\" of his savings account should be his priority going forward. This is especially true with an investment property to take care of \u2014 where unexpected costs may creep up \u2014 and with the family contributions he and Carmela are making.\n\nRon and Carmela Navarro outside of their Troy, Mich., home. CNBC Make It\n\n\"When Ron finishes paying off his cars, he should consider increasing his savings rates that much more,\" she says, which means he could save an additional $900 or more a month. Carmela, too, \"can contribute earnings to her own retirement accounts.\" Finally, Schwab-Pomerantz says it's crucial for Navarro to put his mental and physical health first, especially in such a demanding field. Overtime pay is great, but he also needs to take time for himself and his family. \"While Ron has opportunities for over-time as a registered nurse, it's important that he takes care of his health and doesn't overdo it,\" she says. \"Taking care of his mental and physical health is the best way for Ron to protect his earnings potential and continue taking care of his family, and patients.\"\n\nRon (C) with his wife Carmela (L) and mother (R) CNBC Make It","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":861,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/twitter-misinformation-disputed-tweets-claims-coronavirus\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":[],"title":"Twitter to label misinformation about coronavirus amid flood of false claims and conspiracy theories","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/05\/13\/61934e31-15a1-4716-aaf8-3749cb43c3b1\/thumbnail\/1200x630g2\/e33d148e275264663a30c0d48a986386\/2186-fs-labels-2.jpg","body_text":"Twitter announced Monday that it will start alerting users when a tweet makes disputed or misleading claims about the coronavirus.\n\nThe new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.\n\nThe announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: \"We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.\"\n\nRoth said Monday the platform has historically applied a \"lighter touch\" when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.\n\nAn example of how Twitter will alert users to tweets that spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter\n\nIn February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.\n\nAnd Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the \"public interest\" under a policy the company announced in June 2019.\n\nUnder the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled \u2014 only taking down posts if they are harmful.\n\nPoliticians' tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.\n\nSome of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that \"some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.\"\n\nTwitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.\n\n\"People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,\" Pickles said.\n\nThe notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.\n\nThe fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn't want to be an \"arbiter of the truth\" but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook's fact-checking program.\n\nOne example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.\n\nThe War on Science\n\nTwitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus' spread for several weeks.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":873,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/13\/21257780\/amazon-open-letter-congress-pass-law-price-gouging-masks-hand-sanitizer-covid-19","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":"['Chaim Gartenberg']","title":"Amazon asks Congress to pass a law against price gouging during national crisis","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/psIAww1L4_zdWBg2tPuncNN7DQg=\/0x215:3000x1786\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19218417\/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.png","body_text":"Amazon has requested that Congress pass a law that would make price gouging illegal during times of national crisis, in light of inflated prices on crucial goods like hand sanitizer and N95 masks that have hounded the online retailer during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn an open letter posted by Brian Huseman, Amazon\u2019s VP of public policy, the company highlights its own ongoing efforts to try to crack down on price gouging. To date, Amazon says that it\u2019s removed half a million price-gouged listings from its online stores and has banned 4,000 seller accounts on its US store alone for violating its Fair Pricing Policy. And as CEO Jeff Bezos noted in a letter to investors, Amazon has set up a special line of communication for state attorneys general to directly pass along price gouging complaints.\n\nAmazon says that it can only do so much on its own\n\nBut Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own. The company says that inconsistent state standards limit its ability to crack down on price gouging \u2014 while laws against raising prices during times of crisis currently exist in about two-thirds of the US, the rules are highly inconsistent from state to state. Amazon can kick off as many bad sellers as it can for violating its own policies, but there are often few subsequent legal consequences to help regulate inflated prices.\n\nA federal law, Amazon says, would ensure that there are \u201cno gaps in protection for consumers\u201d and would help Amazon and other retailers \u201cmore effectively prevent bad actors and ensure fair prices.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s proposal would see a price gouging law that \u201cshould kick in immediately when the federal government declares a public health crisis or national emergency, which will leave no room for doubt for businesses and enforcement agencies. It should also establish clear pricing standards, define who and what are covered by the law, and ensure strong enforcement authority.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Amazon\u2019s proposed legislation would ensure that only the party that sets the price \u2014 like, say, a bad third-party Amazon retailer \u2014 be held liable for the inflated price, not the storefront (i.e. Amazon) that hosts that seller and facilitates the sale.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":874,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/columnists\/2020\/5\/13\/21257919\/donald-trump-white-house-coronavirus-facemasks-gene-lyons","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":"['Gene Lyons']","title":"Boss Trump takes precautions while pushing Americans aside","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/vqmIVubiSkM8ExTYMa4ylGGUDAA=\/0x237:3308x1969\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19969326\/1212730142.jpg.jpg","body_text":"Real men don\u2019t wear masks.\n\nEverybody else in the White House has to wear them, and Boss Trump reportedly yells at people who get too close. But he\u2019s no sniveling Democrat taking sensible precautions.\n\nOf course, real men also don\u2019t wear cake makeup, girdles or platform shoes. For that matter, most don\u2019t spend hours each day on their damn hair.\n\nColumnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\nSo, no, I won\u2019t be taking lessons in masculinity from Trump, last seen running away from two journalists \u2014 Weijia Jiang of CBS News and CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins \u2014 who had the temerity to ask why he sneered that Jiang should ask China the \u201cnasty\u201d question she\u2019d asked about testing for COVID-19.\n\nThe CBS correspondent immigrated to the U.S. from China with her parents at age 2. She was raised in West Virginia and educated at the College of William & Mary. She\u2019s as American as Trump. But all he can see is her race.\n\nSo you\u2019d think he\u2019d like Collins, a onetime University of Alabama sorority girl. But Collins also stands up to him. Last month, he tried to get her banished to the back row of the briefing room, but she stood her ground. (The White House Correspondents Association handles seating arrangements.) When he saw her shining face in the front row, Trump fled the room.\n\nOf course, that was soon after his crackpot suggestion that doctors inject disinfectants into COVID-19 patients\u2019 lungs, so perhaps it was just as well.\n\nThe ostensible purpose of Trump\u2019s most recent Rose Garden appearance was to brag that the United States now leads the world in the total number of COVID-19 tests. It\u2019s true that progress has been made, just not nearly enough. This country also leads the world in fatalities by a wide margin. With roughly 5% of the world\u2019s population, Americans comprise more than 25% of the dead.\n\nShocking, isn\u2019t it? A stunning failure of crisis management. Polls increasingly show that White House efforts are failing to convince Americans otherwise. Michigan surveys say that 72% of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s constituents approve of her decisive handling of the pandemic; only 39% think well of Trump\u2019s performance.\n\nYet he urged on a ragged crowd of toy soldiers who descended upon the Michigan state house carrying guns. \u201cLIBERATE Michigan,\u201d Trump tweeted. He derided the state\u2019s governor as \u201cHalf Whitmer,\u201d in one of his typically witless junior high school-style insults.\n\nWomen voters are likely to punish him for that. So you\u2019d have to suspect that Michigan, an important swing state come November, is gone. Ditto Pennsylvania, where the numbers are 72% and 45%, respectively. Another swing state lost, even if Joe Biden hadn\u2019t grown up there.\n\nThirty-nine percent, see, is sufficient to summon a mob, but not to win an election. Also, carrying a gun to a political demonstration will definitely get you on TV. But it pretty much guarantees that you\u2019re losing the argument. People do resent being bullied.\n\nThey\u2019re also resistant to having a matter of personal survival turned into a partisan issue. Thanks to Dr. Anthony Fauci and his colleagues, Americans broadly understand the realities of the pandemic and the dangers of \u201creopening the economy\u201d too soon.\n\nEverybody, absolutely everybody, wants to see normal life return as soon as possible. Me, I\u2019m just lost without baseball. I worry about people I know in the restaurant business, and I\u2019d give a lot to be able to meet friends at the joint down the street for a cold one and a mess of fried catfish.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t give my health or my wife\u2019s. Or my sons\u2019 or my neighbors\u2019. My grandfather Michael Sheedy died in the 1919 Spanish flu epidemic \u2014 that is, after the first wave of infection passed in 1918, only to come back stronger when people convinced themselves it had gone away. It would be catastrophic to see something similar happen again.\n\nAs is quite likely if Boss Trump succeeds in bullying his more heedless supporters into taking foolish risks. Biden recently put it this way in a Washington Post column:\n\n\u201dPresident Trump is reverting to a familiar strategy of deflecting blame and dividing Americans. His goal is as obvious as it is craven: He hopes to split the country into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.\u201d\n\nAs Biden points out, it\u2019s a false choice. These people you see crowding unmasked into just-opened restaurants, rubbing elbows and carrying signs bragging, \u201cI won\u2019t trade my freedom for your safety\u201d are worse than fools.\n\nThey\u2019ve joined a political death cult.\n\nMeanwhile, everybody in the West Wing gets tested every day. They\u2019re contact-tracing and self-isolating as every workplace should in order to control the disease until a vaccine can be found.\n\nBut masks are for protecting other people, and that\u2019s not something Boss Trump has ever cared about.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":876,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/05\/13\/sports\/basketball\/when-nba-come-back.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":"['Marc Stein']","title":"Can the N.B.A. Come Back, and Stay Back?","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/05\/12\/sports\/12nba-steinnewsletter-lede\/12nba-steinnewsletter-lede-facebookJumbo.jpg","body_text":"Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein\u2019s weekly N.B.A. newsletter here.Firm predictions about the fate of professional sports leagues continue to be futile in the midst of a global pandemic.\nWhat N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has proclaimed to be \u201cthe single greatest challenge\u201d the league has ever faced remains its most fluid challenge, too.\nEarly in his conference call Friday night with the N.B.A. Players Association, Silver did say, \u201cSince we stopped the season, the goal has been to restart the season.\u201d Yet it is still only a goal, two months into the suspension of play, in part because no one \u2014 not even Silver \u2014 is sure whether the league can stay back, so to speak, once it comes back.\n\u201cNo decision we make will be risk-free,\u201d Silver told the players, according to a recording of the teleconference reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be living with this virus for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nImagine a rebooted N.B.A. season in July or August. Playing on in the face of new positive tests, player trepidation, gloomy forecasts about a second wave of infections, criticism from countless external forces and the inevitable obstacles we can\u2019t even pinpoint yet \u2014 it all looms as deeply daunting stuff.\nSean Doolittle of the Washington Nationals may as well have been speaking for several of his N.B.A. counterparts on Monday when he unleashed a 16-tweet thread to publicly question what Major League Baseball has planned in terms of \u201cprotections for players, families, staff, stadium workers and the work force it would require to resume a season.\u201d\nThe N.B.A., mind you, is not without hope. There has been some real progress in the testing arena, starting with the Orlando Magic\u2019s ability to secure clearance last week from local health officials and the league to test asymptomatic players and staff members. With the Lakers and Clippers also expected to soon receive similar blessings in Los Angeles, Orlando\u2019s breakthrough makes it somewhat easier to imagine the N.B.A. reaching a point in coming weeks where all 30 teams can administer tests freely without worrying about taking tests from needier segments of the public.\nA far thornier issue for Silver, in his contact sport, figures to be answering the array of health-and-safety questions akin to those Doolittle so forcefully posed to M.L.B.\u2019s elders. Perhaps the resistance is not universal, but there are surely N.B.A. players apprehensive about returning. The question-and-answer session of Silver\u2019s call began and ended with complaints from Oklahoma City\u2019s Chris Paul and the Nets\u2019 Kyrie Irving that some of their peers already feel pressure to return to team practice facilities for individual workouts in what surely rank as the most sanitized gyms on Earth at the moment \u2014 even though only two teams (Cleveland and Portland) had opened their practice facilities at the time of the call.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue employers everywhere are going to have to confront,\u201d Michele Roberts, the union\u2019s executive director, told ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne last week. \u201cBecause I guarantee there\u2019s going to be at least one player, if not many more than that, that are going to have genuine concerns about their safety.\u201d\nSilver does not want to apply pressure. He made it clear to his Friday audience that, while there can be no such thing as a risk-free return without a coronavirus vaccine, players cannot be forced back to work by team owners or the league office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make any decisions that aren\u2019t joint,\u201d Silver told them.As I\u2019ve been advising for weeks, keep your eye on Germany as a possible preview of what awaits Silver\u2019s league this summer. Bundesliga soccer isn\u2019t N.B.A. basketball, but the Bundesliga is a league of global stature and poised to return to operations this weekend with what it calls \u201cghost games\u201d \u2014 matches without fans.\nThe Bundesliga approach calls for any player or team staff member who tests positive to be quarantined for 14 days \u2014 while the rest of the group carries on.\nCould that sort of protocol work on these shores? Would N.B.A. players really stomach the idea of showing up for the next day\u2019s practice or game after a teammate or two was forced into quarantine? Are teams in North America, and their fans, prepared to accept the possibility that a star player will be forced to leave the team for up to two weeks in the middle of the playoffs as if he had sustained a more common injury? Are the star player\u2019s teammates going to be willing to play without him?\nDo we dare limit our focus to those sufficiently unsettling questions without asking: What if someone dies?\nWe don\u2019t have any detailed answers yet. Nor, frankly, do the German soccer authorities, who are at least two months ahead of the N.B.A. Dynamo Dresden, in the Bundesliga\u2019s second tier, will not return to the field this weekend as scheduled, because local health authorities demanded that the entire team be quarantined after two new coronavirus cases, overruling the league officials who would merely have isolated the individuals who had tested positive.\nSo we repeat: Coming back is one thing. Staying back is another entirely.There is no mystery, by contrast, about the forces behind the push for a conclusion to the 2019-20 season. Nearly 80 percent of the 82-game schedule was completed before play was suspended, but crowning a champion, as the N.B.A. has managed to do in each of its previous 73 seasons, is a secondary aim at this point.\nIt\u2019s a money thing as much as anything.Silver told players that game-night income from fans accounts for roughly 40 percent of the league\u2019s annual revenue, drawing focus to concerns about the financial consequences of a canceled season \u2014 how that would affect the salary cap, free agency, future earnings and the very existence of the current collective bargaining agreement. The gravity of Silver\u2019s statement, with no one in the league expecting to see fans in its buildings before 2021 at the earliest, needed little elaboration.\nYet the money vs. safety calculus is as tricky as it gets. Critics will say that the N.B.A. is irresponsible in hurrying to come back before there is a significant medical development to combat the coronavirus. Defenders will counter by pointing out that there\u2019s little benefit to waiting for a comeback when the conditions may be no more favorable in the winter than they are in the summer or fall.\nSilver stressed to the players that no decisions have to be made before June 1 \u2014 that there\u2019s still time \u2014 but the clock\u2019s ticking will surely get a lot louder for everyone the closer we get to July.\nThe math will have to get done at some point. The lone comfort for the players is that they will have a louder voice than usual.\nThe very personal assessment involved in deciding \u201chow much risk we\u2019re all comfortable taking,\u201d as Silver put it, was nobody\u2019s idea of player empowerment when the season started.

Can anyone explain this? \u2014 @joey_buckets3 from Twitter\nStein: The Cleveland Cavaliers aren\u2019t going to the playoffs even if the N.B.A. manages to restart its 2019-20 season. Yet the Cavs were the first franchise to welcome players back Friday when teams in states where shelter-in-place restrictions have been eased were allowed to unlock their practice facilities.\nOne of the best explanations came from Cleveland\u2019s Larry Nance Jr. After spending about 90 minutes Friday lifting weights and partaking in some catch-and-shoot drills, Nance said, \u201cIt was more for mental health than physical, to be honest with you.\u201d\nAllowing players to return to the gym, even if teams are initially limited to a maximum of four players inside at any time, is the first step back toward normalcy for athletes whose lives have been disrupted like never before by the coronavirus. It\u2019s also a matter of safety. League and team officials think it\u2019s wisest to make their own facilities available to discourage players from seeking out unauthorized gyms that aren\u2019t sanitized to the same standard.\nBut there are other good reasons. The N.B.A., for starters, has made it clear that it hopes to resume play with a few regular-season games involving all 30 teams, not just those who were playoff-bound when play was halted March 11.\nAnother one: As we\u2019ve discussed in the newsletter previously, many N.B.A. athletic training staffs would want to give their players up to six weeks\u2019 worth of supervised prep time before games restarted after such a long layoff. The more likely scenario is a ramp-up period closer to three weeks to give the league as much of the summer as possible to complete as much of the remaining schedule as it can.\nFrom a league perspective, by making facilities available to players well before teams officially reconvene, it can assert that players have been provided a theoretical head start on the road to getting back into basketball shape to compensate for the potential forthcoming crunch.\nQ: Why do league rules prohibit teams from buying these hoops? \u2014 @NateAllard from TwitterStein: Nate\u2019s question comes in response to my recent piece with Scott Cacciola on the reality that many N.B.A. players, counterintuitive as it sounds, do not have a basket at home and thus have struggled to get shots up during a suspension of play that hit the two-month mark on Monday.\nIn March, the league informed teams that furnishing players with \u201cindividual workout equipment of a modest cost\u201d was permissible. But buying a hoop, they were told, would be considered salary-cap circumvention.\nThe list of approved equipment for teams to supply includes workout mats, workout balls, resistance bands and \u201cmodest\u201d free-weight sets. Paying for the delivery of boxed meals to players is also allowed.\nQ: Great memories from that Knicks-Lakers Game 7 in 1970. I, too, was there as a 13-year-old, like Spike Lee, and went with my friend, whose father had tickets in Section 106. A reporter from Los Angeles, Bud Furillo, helped us get some autographs. I recognize Donnie May and Mike Riordan in the main photo that ran with your story, but who is the player on the right? \u2014 Paul Winston\nStein: Leaping in the air in that photo, in celebration, was Cazzie Russell. We initially had the photo captioned improperly last week, but the error was quickly spotted by a few Knicks die-hards who wrote in \u2014 like Morton Frank of Redwood City, Calif.\nAs Mr. Frank put it, \u201cCazzie\u2019s Adidas sneakers and comparatively low socks\u201d are clear giveaways for some fans. \u201cTo this day, I can give you the same detail and trivia on the whole team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo love the old Knicks is to love them all the way.\u201d\nI really enjoyed talking to Spike and Marv Albert (and our own Harvey Araton) to learn more about that team and that series, because I certainly wasn\u2019t consuming any of it as a 1-year-old.\nIt\u2019s always bothered me that history doesn\u2019t get passed down with the same vigor in basketball as it does in baseball, which has sparked me in adulthood to embrace every opportunity to find out more about the long-overlooked 1970s, which was a period of great struggle for the sport.\nFor Knicks fans especially, Friday\u2019s 50th anniversary of the win that clinched the first title in franchise history was a welcome respite, since this season was otherwise destined to be remembered for the curiously timed ousters of David Fizdale and Steve Mills; James L. Dolan\u2019s shabby treatment of Lee; and multiple instances in which the sad state of the franchise inspired loud \u201cSell the Team\u201d chants.\n\nNumbers Game\n4With 36 points and 19 assists in the Knicks\u2019 Game 7 triumph over the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1970 N.B.A. finals, Walt Frazier is one of only four players in league history to post at least 20 points and 10 assists in a Game 7 of the league\u2019s championship series, according to Basketball Reference. The others:Jerry West (42 points, 12 assists and 13 rebounds in the Lakers\u2019 Game 7 loss to Boston in 1969)James Worthy (36 points, 10 assists and 16 rebounds in the Lakers\u2019 Game 7 victory over Detroit in 1988)LeBron James (27 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds in Cleveland\u2019s Game 7 win at Golden State in 2016 to complete the Cavaliers\u2019 comeback from a 3-1 series deficit against the 73-win Warriors)12For all the attention Willis Reed\u2019s thigh injury in the 1970 finals understandably still gets, we can\u2019t forget that knee surgery limited the Lakers\u2019 Wilt Chamberlain to a career-low 12 games during the regular season. Chamberlain played the final three regular-season games after a four-month absence and then appeared in 18 games that postseason for the Lakers, averaging 22.1 points and 22.2 rebounds.\n9Michael Jordan lost nine of his first 10 N.B.A. playoff games with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the Bulls to a playoff mark of 95-31 in winning six championships between 1991 and 1998, although he missed the 1993-94 N.B.A. season while playing Class AA baseball for the Birmingham Barons.\n2With Jordan in uniform, Chicago was pushed to only two Game 7s in the 1990s and won both, outlasting the Knicks in the 1992 Eastern Conference semifinals and defeating Indiana in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals.\n99.1The N.B.A. has instructed teams to refuse admittance to practice facilities for anyone who registers a temperature higher than 99.1 degrees. The threshold was 99.5 degrees for Taiwan\u2019s Super Basketball League when it checked players as they entered the HaoYu Basketball Training Center during the S.B.L.\u2019s recent playoffs.\n\nHit me up anytime on Twitter (@TheSteinLine) or Facebook (@MarcSteinNBA) or Instagram (@marcsteinnba).

Only half of the people are wearing a mask,\u201d Murphy said Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s data from the phone companies about how people move. They\u2019re moving around more. There\u2019s definitely more traffic.\u201d\n\nWhile he said the pervasive toll is also attributable in part to increased testing and workers returning to their jobs, Murphy noted that keeping social distancing measures in place longer \u2014 and following them \u2014 is vitally important for beating back the coronavirus.\n\nRecent figures have shown the disease is still spreading rapidly through communities. On Tuesday, state officials reported 4,014 new cases of COVID-19, the most recorded in a single day. And on Wednesday, the 192 reported deaths marked another grim benchmark.\n\n\u201cThe same thing happened in northern Italy and in Spain, where they just felt like they were not getting ahead,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt finally turned around there when they got serious with all the shelter-in-place.\n\n\u201cBut I mean, everybody here seems to be just ready to chuck it and just go back to doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nMurphy specifically took aim at leaders pushing to relax restrictions locally. As he sees it, the clearest way to vanquish the disease is actually to \u201ctighten it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should not be loosening up. You know, like McHenry County and DuPage County want to have their own rules. Idiots!\u201d he said, apparently referencing a push by leaders in the collar counties to be moved into a region in the governor\u2019s Restore Illinois plan that doesn\u2019t include Cook County in hopes they can reopen businesses sooner.\n\nMeanwhile, both Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike spent a good portion of Wednesday\u2019s news conference harping on the fact that the virus remains a real and serious threat.\n\n\u201cThis virus is still among us,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThis pandemic is not over. And to pretend otherwise in a misguided attempt to reclaim what we\u2019ve lost will only make this last longer.\u201d\n\nBut even Murphy, a noted expert on infectious diseases, is struggling to truly understand the disease that has killed thousands across the state.\n\n\u201cSome places have turned it around, so what are we doing wrong? What else do we have to do? That\u2019s what we have to figure out.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":881,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/military-emergency-powers-to-treat-troops-with-covid-19-drugs-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":"['Jennifer Bard', 'The Conversation']","title":"Why the military can treat service members for COVID-19 with drugs that haven't been approved for it","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5ebb150357853232406a76da?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Features inherent in the military \u2014 large groups of people often in tight quarters \u2014 make infectious disease a particular threat.\n\nThe military has the authority to treat troops with drugs approved for other conditions or with newly developed drugs, which presents a legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nInfectious disease has always been one of the military's greatest threats. By its own estimates, the US Army lost almost as many soldiers from the 1918 flu as died on the battlefields of the first World War.\n\nTroops are at risk during an outbreak due to the tight quarters in which they live and work. It is therefore not surprising that all branches of the service \u2014 Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard \u2014 have been hit hard by COVID-19.\n\nThe military has also played an important role in responding to the virus, from evacuating State Department officials from Wuhan in January to its current role building and staffing civilian field hospitals and augmenting civilian research teams.\n\nTo mitigate any risk, the Department of Defense has enforced rigorous social distancing policies and a military-wide travel ban halting nonessential deployments.\n\nNew treatments\n\nSoldiers at US Army Garrison Casey conduct pre-screening processes on individuals awaiting entry to the base, USAG-Casey, Dongducheon, South Korea, February 26, 2020. US Army\/Sgt. Amber I. Smith\n\nBut in addition to measures aimed at keeping people away from sources of infection, the military is also treating active-duty personnel who become infected. Because the COVID-19 virus is new, there are as yet no FDA approved treatments.\n\nAs a result, military physicians are turning to either treatments approved for other conditions or seeking access to newly developed treatments, such as the antiviral Remdesivir, which to date has received FDA emergency use approval only for COVID-19 patients with severe conditions. That presents a significant legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.\n\nAs an expert in public health law and human subject research, I study the tension between protecting participants of biomedical research and responding quickly to emerging threats. But I have also had personal experience with the events that led to the passing of the law that allows the military to work with the FDA in order to get emergency authorization to respond quickly to emerging threats.\n\nGulf War syndrome\n\nUS soldiers huddle in a bunker in Eastern Saudi Arabia with gas masks and chemical suits after US planes started bombing Iraq, January 18, 1991. Peter Dejong\/AP\n\nIn 1998, I was working for now US Senator, then Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal when I met Russ Dingle and Thomas \"Buzz\" Rempfer, two remarkable airmen who filed a whistleblower complaint seeking protection from what they described as forced participation in an unlawful research experiment.\n\nSpecifically, they asserted that the Department of Defense was mandating that all active duty personnel be vaccinated against anthrax using a product, AVA, not yet approved by the FDA for the purpose the Army was now using it.\n\nThe vaccine had been in use since the 1970s to protect wool workers and veterinarians at risk from touching naturally occurring anthrax spores, but had not been approved for protection against inhaling them, a method of spread reportedly developed by Iraqi scientists as a bioweapon.\n\nBut many in the military were reluctant to be vaccinated because of their concern that it might be a cause of Gulf War Syndrome. To this day, there is no agreement about the specific symptoms, let alone cause, of Gulf War Syndrome.\n\nA 2000 report by the well-respected Institute of Medicine found \"no conclusive link to the vaccine.\" But the causal connection seemed plausible to many sufferers, especially given the continuing emergence of long-term harm suffered by veterans of the Vietnam War and their children from exposure to Agent Orange.\n\nThe whistleblower's primary claim was that the anthrax vaccination program was \"research\" and therefore the army was required to abide by two different protections. The first, called the Common Rule, is a law establishing that all research conducted by the federal government require the informed consent of participants.\n\nTheir second claim was that even if it was being used as a preventative measure, the Department of Defense was constrained by a 1998 law passed in direct response to concerns over possible links between unapproved drugs and Gulf War Syndrome. It prohibited \"the administration of investigational new drugs, or drugs unapproved for their intended use, to service members without their informed consent\" unless consent was waived by the president.\n\nBlumenthal wrote to the secretary of defense warning him that administering an unapproved vaccine risked violating both laws and demanding that the research be stopped. That letter became part of a larger debate over whether the military's need for force protection exceeded the risks to any individual serviceperson.\n\nEmergency use\n\nAn unidentified worker in a biohazard suit hands off a bag to a worker after exiting the American Media Inc, building on Saturday, August 31, 2002, in Boca Raton, Florida. Teams of FBI agents and scientists entered the quarantined former headquarters of The National Enquirer for a second day Saturday, scouring the building for clues in the anthrax attack. Steve Mitchell\/AP\n\nIn 2003, Col. Rempfer and six other at first unnamed plaintiffs brought suit in federal court which resulted in a preliminary injunction halting the vaccine program.\n\nResponding to the lawsuit, the Department of Defense denied that they were conducting research and claimed the authority to waive consent because it was necessary to prevent infection with weaponized anthrax.\n\nBut in winning the battle, those seeking to stop the vaccine program lost the war. The Department of Defense appealed to Congress for a workaround. It resulted in the passing of the BioShield Act in 2004, creating the Emergency Use Authorization.\n\nThis gave the FDA authority to recharacterize the status of a drug or vaccine from investigational to approved for emergency use. In December of 2005 it issued a \"final order concluding that [the Anthrax Vaccine] was the best available medical countermeasure to the potential military emergency.\"\n\nAlthough Col. Rempfer filed a lawsuit to protest the FDA's decision, it was to no avail, and shortly afterward the Department of Defense resumed the vaccine program. Col. Dingle died of cancer in 2008, but Col. Rempfer remained critical of the anthrax vaccine program and still actively advocates on behalf of past and future military personnel.\n\nA compromise\n\nUS Navy Counselor 2nd Class Caileigh Almazo, assigned to the guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd, checks-in other sailors assigned to the ship after its arrival in San Diego as part of the Navy\u2019s aggressive response to the COVID-19 outbreak on board the ship, April 28, 2020. US Navy\/MCS 2nd Class Alex Corona\n\nSince the passage of the BioShield Act, Congress has continued to support the FDA's authority to make unapproved drugs available in response to new threats. In 2017, the Department of Defense sought power to unilaterally authorize use of unapproved drugs in battlefield situations.\n\nIn the face of FDA objections to this level of autonomy, Congress created a compromise measure memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding that allows the Department of Defense broad authority to declare the need for emergency use permission and request that the FDA \"take actions to expedite the development of a medical product.\" But final authority to issue an emergency use order rests with the president.\n\nIt is because of the servicemen committed to the preservation of informed consent that troops today have early access to potential COVID-19 drugs and vaccines while still respecting their vulnerability as patients without the complete ability to give informed consent.\n\nJennifer Bard, Visiting Professor of Law, University of Florida\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Alessandra Tarantino\/AP\n\nRome \u2014 Italy will give temporary work permits to more than half a million undocumented migrants deemed essential to picking crops and caring for the elderly amid the country's coronavirus lockdown as part of a stimulus package agreed late Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"We have worked on this decree knowing that the country is in great difficulty,\" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said after a cabinet meeting.\n\nFor more than two months, stay-at-home orders have prevented seasonal laborers from Eastern Europe traveling to Italy to work in farming. The glut of farm hands has fueled fears of food shortages and led the agriculture industry to rely on an estimated 500,000 illicitly hired, unregistered migrants, largely from North Africa, as spring crops ripen in the fields.\n\n\"The food on our table comes from these fields. Now we must hand over those rights which have been denied to those who work in them,\" said Peppe Provenzano, minister for the south of Italy.\n\nU.S. farmers struggle with coronavirus' effect on labor\n\nAgriculture lobbies had warned that Italy risked wasting massive amounts of produce if nobody was there to pick it, exacerbating the fallout of a shutdown already costing the food sector more than $7.5 billion in the country.\n\n\n\nThe measure approved Wednesday was proposed by Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova as part of a long-delayed stimulus package of nearly $60 billion meant to help Italy's beleaguered businesses and families weather the pandemic and lockdown.\n\n\n\n\"This decree provides the prerequisites so that this phase of reopening can immediately offer the prospect of an economic and social recovery,\" Conte told journalists.\n\n\n\nProponents of the measure say it will advance public health interests, too, as migrants won't need to hide from authorities any longer in squats and camps where poor hygiene conditions make fertile ground for coronavirus clusters.\n\n\n\nThe move came after Pope Francis decried \"farm hands exploited in the countryside,\" saying \"dignity should be given to work,\" with proper pay and safe conditions.\n\nItaly struggles to find space for bodies despite flattening virus curve\n\nThe measure also applies to about 100,000 undocumented migrants who assist the elderly \u2014 the demographic most severely at risk in an outbreak that has already killed 31,106 people in Italy. It's the third-highest recorded death toll in the world, after the United States and Britain.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the decree sparked a major controversy in a country whose gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to shrink by more than 9% and where unemployment is projected to reach 12.7% by the end of the year, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Matteo Salvini, of the nationalist League party, blasted the decision in a Twitter post, saying: \"Why should we ever reward those illegals and those who exploit them when there are so many Italians and legal migrants looking for a job?\"\n\n\n\nThe hardline position was previously backed by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S), which shares power with the center-left Democrats in a coalition government. But M5S dropped its opposition as it risked toppling the fragile coalition under Prime Minister Conte.\n\n\n\nLocated just a few hundred miles from the coast of North Africa, Italy has been by far the largest European destination for migrants setting sail from Libya and Tunisia in the past decade.\n\n16,000 migrants have fled to Lesbos this year \u2013 and there\u2019s only one humanitarian boat left to help\n\nMore than 6 million migrants were living in Italy in 2019. More than 500,000 of them were undocumented, according to an annual report by the Ismu Foundation, a think-tank focused on migration issues.\n\n\n\nThe stimulus package, originally promised last month, takes immediate effect, and comes on the heels of an initial $27 billion package introduced in March. It includes a mix of tax cuts and grants to help businesses survive the economic downturn, while also aiming to help families with subsidies for childcare, and to boost the ravaged tourism sector.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":888,"url":"https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2020\/05\/masks-coronavirus-america.html","publisher":"Slate","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Dahlia Lithwick']","title":"The American obsession with individualism and the refusal to wear a mask.","image":"https:\/\/compote.slate.com\/images\/eed47f4e-65db-46d7-ae08-f5b6e5e2b37c.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0","body_text":"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images Plus.\n\nIt is strange, about the masks.\n\nThat it\u2019s masks that have become charged objects, signifying the difference between Americans who want to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 and those who refuse to believe in COVID-19, is no longer in doubt. As Ryan Lizza and Daniel Lippman wrote in early May, as the pandemic has progressed, the American left has largely been willing to sacrifice personal liberties in exchange for containing the virus. And while most on the political right have agreed to take precautions like staying home, a \u201cvocal activist wing of conservatism that has enormous influence on social media and Fox News, has been far more willing to attack the various infringements on where people can go and what they have to wear.\u201d As a result, Lizza and Lippman conclude, \u201cthe mask has become the ultimate symbol of this new cultural and political divide.\u201d\n\nNowhere has the split been more pronounced than within the White House itself, where the Trump administration\u2019s own guidelines ask Americans to wear masks in public spaces to slow the spread and yet the president himself does not. After a White House valet tested positive for COVID-19 last week, President Donald Trump announced that the valets who serve food and work around him are now required to wear masks, although he and Vice President Mike Pence continue to refuse to do so. As Ron Elving notes, political leaders often do symbolic things to model behavior they want emulated, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been adamant that modeling such public safety measures is essential. (She matches her masks to her pantsuits.) But for Trump and those around him, refusing to don face coverings\u2014even during visits with vulnerable populations like 95-year-old World War II veterans\u2014seems to signal, well, something. But what?\n\nFrank Bruni argues that the message from the White House is that \u201cmasks are emblems, maybe the best ones, of the Trump administration\u2019s disregard for, and degradation of, experts and expertise.\u201d Lippman and Lizza wonder whether the rejection of masks says something like \u201cI don\u2019t have to wear a mask because I have access to regular testing,\u201d adding that \u201cin that sense, being in close proximity to people without covering your face is a kind of new status symbol for the pandemic era.\u201d Liz Plank argues that Trump would rather endanger himself and others. Anna North makes a parallel argument: \u201cSuch militaristic, tough-guy messaging, along with Trump\u2019s refusal to wear a mask, may encourage ordinary people\u2014especially men\u2014to minimize the risk of coronavirus for the sake of appearing manly.\u201d North further points out that American racial bias also plays a fundamental role in the refusal to cover one\u2019s face: Whereas young black men are perceived as doubly dangerous when they are masked, some white men like to perform their own immunity from criminal consequences by refusing to cover up.\n\nAnd that is the point. Trump and Pence\u2019s public defiance of the guidance that suggests covering one\u2019s face is best for your own safety and the safety of others is itself contagious. When Trump visited Phoenix recently, some of his fans harassed and insulted local journalists who were wearing masks, insisting that the reporters were \u201conly wearing masks to instill fear,\u201d BrieAnna Frank, with the Arizona Republic, later said. She posted a viral Twitter thread of journalists derided for being \u201con the wrong side of patriotism\u201d and \u201clike communists.\u201d One man said of assembled male journalists in masks, \u201cIt\u2019s submission, it\u2019s muzzling yourself, it looks weak\u2014especially for men.\u201d Around the country, we\u2019ve seen retail workers and restaurant employees violently assaulted for asking customers to cover up. The guiding theory seems to be that since only the weak will die, the burden shifts to them alone to protect themselves.\n\nThere is no question that there are race, gender, and power distortions that lead some Americans to see face covering as a sign of vulnerability, weakness, or surrender. But it strikes me that there is another layer\u2014even above and beyond a denial of facts and science\u2014that must be at play: There is an obsession with being seen and recognized that feels quintessentially American, even in situations of life and death.\n\nThere is an obsession with being seen and recognized that feels quintessentially American, even in situations of life and death.\n\nIt can\u2019t be mere coincidence that some of the loudest objectors to masking try to advance First Amendment arguments about their right to express who they are. Paradoxically perhaps, state laws that ban the wearing of masks have been on the books for centuries in this country\u2014and almost always survive constitutional scrutiny. (Many were adopted in response to the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s use of hoods and masks to hide identities as members terrorized black communities. Now that mask wearing is allowed, and encouraged by the left, perhaps it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that the California man who wore a Klan mask to go shopping last week will not be charged.) But there is something about the affirmative choice to refuse to wear a mask right now that feels connected to yet another distinctly American pathology. Just as some dissenters resoundingly fail to understand that the First Amendment doesn\u2019t give them the right to be heard and seen by everyone at all times, or to say whatever they wish without consequences, some appear to believe that their right to perform their freedom, up to and including with weapons of war, is constitutionally limitless. Right now, the right to breathe unobstructed into everyone in your path is, in its way, a weapon. And wanting the world to see your face unobstructed as you do so feels like a damaged idea of freedom. Historically, masks were preferred by mobs who wanted to do violence unrecognized. Now the masks impair the performance of violence, and the credit and fame that go with it.\n\nBecause we are in the midst of a reality show presidency, in which the unending public performance of self by the president is the only coin of the realm, it is hardly surprising that Donald Trump refuses to be masked. The carnival, the play, the show, after all, is the entirety of governance. And that people who believe that the hallmark of constitutional democracy is the loud, unfettered performance of self, regardless of its consequences for others, similarly refuse to go unseen and uncredited, is the obvious corollary. If you maintain that your freedom to ritually enact your ineffable you-ness at the expense of everyone else is what makes America different, it stands to reason that masks feel akin to tyranny. As Lydia Denworth put it in Scientific American, one of the reasons the wearing of masks has never become a norm in America is that the impulse to think collectively about disease was never necessarily fully integrated: \u201cThe point is that masks do not just protect the wearer, they protect others. Such community-minded thinking fits with collectivist cultural norms in some parts of Asia, where masks are routinely worn when one is sick\u2014and where there is more experience with serious epidemics.\u201d\n\nThis may even explain why some root their refusal to cover up in religious arguments, also swept in under the First Amendment. An Ohio lawmaker, Republican state Rep. Nino Vitale, declined to wear the mask required by his state\u2019s Department of Health director, because, as he explained in a Facebook post last week, \u201cThis is the greatest nation on earth founded on Judeo-Christian principles. One of those principles is that we are all created in the image and likeness of God. That image is seen the most by our face. I will not wear a mask.\u201d His logic was uniquely illogical: \u201cNo one is stopping anybody from wearing a face mask. But quite frankly everyone else\u2019s freedom ends at the tip of my nose. You\u2019re not going to tell me what to do and there\u2019s a lot of people that feel that way.\u201d The idea that God wants to see our faces so very badly that we should be allowed to harm and possibly kill everyone with whom we come in contact is a uniquely self-regarding view of religious faith. But if one believes that the self is the only meaningful actor in a democracy, or a theocracy, it perhaps stands to reason.\n\nThe simplest explanation for the insistence that wearing masks is for thee, but not for me, rests in the fundamental narcissism of Donald Trump, and the booming cottage industry on the part of right-wing media in so-called vice-signaling\u2014the performative acting out of malice and cruelty toward the weak. The more complicated answer, it seems, is that in a country founded on a long mythology of the Lone Ranger, Batman, Zorro, and Captain America, the mask has somehow come to signal invisibility, and the death of rugged individualism\u2014perhaps even more so because everyone is now wearing one. For those who have come to feel devalued, degraded, left behind, or shunted aside, being asked to hide one\u2019s face must be the ultimate act of public cruelty. If we have come to believe that each of us is only as important as our ability to be seen and heard, the mask must make that erasure complete. It\u2019s not just the toxic myth of rugged individuals pitted against government and the weak that is gutting us. It\u2019s the poisonous notion that unless we are being seen acting out rugged individualism, we don\u2019t even exist.\n\nFor more of Slate\u2019s politics coverage, listen to The Political Gabfest.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":889,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/14\/21258868\/amazon-engineers-face-shields-frontline-workers-coronavirus","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Kim Lyons']","title":"Amazon engineers develop face shields for frontline workers","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/FtMeQna8LHpZleBFIZUNVD_ttro=\/0x202:1600x1040\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19974517\/face_shield_bigger.png","body_text":"A team of Amazon engineers from its drone delivery unit worked with a group of 3D printing volunteers to develop reusable face shields for frontline workers, the company announced in a blog post Thursday.\n\nAmazon Prime Air\u2019s mechanical design and hardware teams adapted the design for the shields from the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub, upgrading the shields to be more comfortable and the design more practical based on feedback from medical professionals.

The economy is unlikely to fully recover until the end of 2021, the EC report says. According to European Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, \u201cEurope is experiencing an economic shock without precedent since the Great Depression.\u201d The European Commissioner said that the scale of the economic downturn and the speed of economic recovery would vary for different EU regions and would depend on how quickly a country would lift quarantine measures, how much a country depends on tourism as well as on the general state of its economy. \u201cThese differences pose a threat to the single market and the Eurozone,\u201d the official said. What\u2019s your take on this?\n\nRumen Gechev: At this stage, the EC estimates seem quite objective, provided that in the next two to three months the main restrictions caused by COVID-19 will be lifted. GDP will fall by at least 10-12% as a result of a serious decline in investment and consumption, severely hampered exports in the EU \u2013 and especially outside the EU \u2013 as well as rapidly growing unemployment and a chain of bankruptcy cases. Of course, the scale of the crisis will vary depending on the structure of individual national economies and their external logistics chains. The EC and the ECB, which have learned from the mistake of pursuing austerity policies during the previous crisis of 2007-2009, have now taken the right path providing companies and households with large-scale liquidity by issuing interest-free loans, credit guarantees and easing loan guarantee requirements, gratuitous assistance, as well by issuing direct and indirect subsidies. The EC announced that it was temporarily abandoning the restrictions imposed on budget deficit size and the share of government debt on GDP. The green light was also given to provide state assistance to private companies.\n\nHowever, such relaxation can have a very high price. The Eurozone has somewhat \u201cslowed down;\u201d it had faced serious economic and financial problems even before the crisis started. Despite banking control tightening, many Eurozone banks have ended up in turbulent conditions. For example, Deutsche Bank has suffered huge losses for several years, while it directly or indirectly controls more than $2 trillion worth of assets in Germany, the EU, the US and other countries.\n\nThe bankruptcy of tens of thousands of firms and the increase in unemployment means that a critically large number of legal entities and individuals won\u2019t be able to service their loans. This time, unlike the previous crisis, governments won\u2019t be able to allocate budgetary funds to help banks that find themselves in a difficult situation. Firstly, because budget expenditures have already increased significantly, and secondly, because taxpayers won\u2019t agree to again help banks with their own money. The situation is worsening because even before the crisis, countries didn\u2019t agree on a new EU budget for 2020 due to increased internal disagreements after Brexit. It turned out that Germany and France, especially Germany, didn\u2019t want to increase their contribution to the EU budget. After that, it became clear that expectations regarding some kind of general fiscal policy, including creating a Eurozone finance ministry, were unrealistic. Plans to issue debt securities are unlikely to be realized because, at this stage, Germany and the Netherlands categorically refuse to allocate their national budget resources for that. Thus, a common fight against COVID-19 is impossible without the overall financing of anti-crisis measures. And it is precisely this lack of solidarity that poses the greatest danger to the Eurozone. This is an extremely big risk, even in the medium term. If this risk is not minimized, if it is not possible to reach solutions acceptable to everyone, another serious Eurozone crisis could lead to the collapse of the European Union.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS \/ HENRY NICHOLLS Commuters, some wearing masks are seen at Canning Town station, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), London, Britain, May 13, 2020.\n\nSputnik: Which European countries do you think will suffer the most, and who will most easily get through the post-coronavirus economic depression? Is out of sync recovery really a threat to the EU single market? What should be done? Is it urgently \u201cpouring\u201d additional EU funds into the economies of the countries that would suffer most, or is there any other option?\n\nRumen Gechev: The real results of the crisis will become clear at least in a few months. The countries that are likely to suffer the most are states with the highest share of tourism in their GDP \u2013 Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Bulgaria, etc., as well as countries with hub airports, and therefore with large passenger flows.\n\nIn the long run, this crisis cannot be resolved only through money injections. At the moment, this is exactly what EU governments are doing, of course, with some slight differences in volume and tools.\n\nThe EU\u2019s foreign economic relations, production organization and sustainability amid such an external shock should be comprehensively reevaluated; this especially concerns key industries that ensure regional and national security. Some production facilities are most likely to be withdrawn from China, or substitute capacities will be created in the EU. This is a chance for countries such as Bulgaria: countries that may be suitable for such a relocation of production capacity. This is probably a chance for real progress towards convergence between less and more developed European economies, which has been proclaimed for many years. Without reducing technological and socio-economic differences, it is impossible to overcome the dangerous stagnation in integration processes.\n\nTalking to Russian RBC, Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said:\n\n\u201cToday, they often say that there is no leader in global politics and several countries claim this role. This situation creates new opportunities for the European Union, given its reputation as a player capable of offering constructive solutions to problems, acting in different directions and in the most difficult situations.\u201d\n\nSputnik: Considering difficult Sino-American relations, can the EU in the post-COVID era become the new global leader, or is it just flaunting amid the difficult situation with the coronavirus, where the EU started responding quite late, which has in due time caused discontent in Italy, for example?\n\nRumen Gechev: Unfortunately, the EU won\u2019t be able to take the opportunity of being a global leader. If Germany is excluded, other leading countries (France, Italy, Spain) remain captive to fiscal deficits, debts, and worsening social and domestic political problems. Italy\u2019s banking and fiscal system was already on the razor\u2019s edge, and now it needs to solve the terrifying problems cause by the coronavirus. France is also facing a serious challenge. Every government\u2019s attempt to reform pensions, for example, faces mass protests of \u201cYellow Vests\u201d on Champs Elysees. And as soon as quarantine restrictions are lifted, protests are likely to continue. Yes, the EU is a significant economic centre in the global economy, but its weight in international politics doesn\u2019t correspond to economic opportunities. For example, the prospects of creating a common EU army are far-fetched; and without its own army, the EU will continue to depend on NATO.\n\nU.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Corey Hook An F-16 Desert Falcon of the United Arab Emirates maneuvers at the Bahrain International Airshow in 2016.\n\nSputnik: In 2019, Bulgaria rated first in terms of military spending growth, due to its purchase of American F-16s. At the same time, according to Eurostat, Bulgaria has the lowest minimum wage in the EU (\u20ac312). According to a study by the 24 Chasa newspaper, Bulgarian pensions are among the lowest not only in the EU, but also in the Balkans. Why do you think the government decided to purchase the aircraft, the price of which greatly exceeded the original maximum? Both President Rumen Radev and many MPS pointed to the fact that the deal implied reduced opportunities, but Valentin Radev from the ruling GERB Party noted that that purchase brought Bulgaria closer to NATO, its strategic partner, where the United States is \u201cthe front man.\u201d Do you think the choice is due primarily to this, or is Sofia really facing serious security challenges?\n\nRumen Gechev: Bulgaria is a NATO member, and it should fulfil its obligations under the treaty. But it should be clarified that this should be mutually beneficial; as for the F-16 case, there are several serious problems. Firstly, according to experts, this model has exhausted its capabilities, even in the new Block 70 modification. Therefore, the Pentagon hasn\u2019t bought this aircraft for more than five years. It seems that we\u2019ve become part of a marketing strategy to extend the old product\u2019s life cycle. Secondly, the price for Bulgaria is now higher than for other buyers. The explanation that this is so because the F-16 is supposedly our first purchase seems rather strange. Thirdly, in order to avoid a higher price \u2013 higher than what had previously been approved by the parliament \u2013 the government resorted to removing part of the armament and manning. In other words, additional costs will now follow. Fourthly, we are buying a modification that still exists only on paper. What are the guarantees that the product will be successful when its delivery actually becomes possible? What are the guarantees that there will be no delays, as was the case with the F-35, for example? Fifthly, the fact that such an extremely expensive product has only six months of warranty, which is four times less than the warranty for electrical appliances in the EU, is a scandal. Sixthly, we paid the full price in advance \u2013 both for the drawing and for the promise to deliver the aircraft from 2023. But it recently became known that deliveries can actually last until January 2027! That is, the people of Bulgaria pay the whole amount in advance and receive equipment in 7-8 years. Here, as they say, common sense fails to appreciate the so-called Euro-Atlantic solidarity, which is unilaterally served by the current Bulgarian government.\n\nSputnik: The other day, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that Sofia could block the start of negotiations on Northern Macedonia\u2019s joining the EU if Skopje didn\u2019t comply with the Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness. At the same time, the EU called on Northern Macedonia to comply with the terms of the treaty. In your opinion, can Bulgaria arrange a \u201cGreek\u201d scenario for Skopje? Recall that Athens has for many years blocked the Euro-Atlantic integration of its northern neighbour. Or, if the leading EU countries are determined to give Northern Macedonia the green light, will Sofia remove the conditions and stop arguing with its Western EU partners?\n\nRumen Gechev: For Bulgaria, the issue of Macedonia is extremely sensitive, since the land and population of this country are part of our historical past; today we speak different dialects of the same language. Of course, part of Northern Macedonian political elite has a different opinion and defends its own interests. We have irrefutable historical evidence that they steal our history, the history of Bulgaria. We cannot agree that the Bulgarian kings and historical figures are declared Macedonians and that their history books are full of distorted historical facts. Therefore, I would say that, unfortunately, the government led by Borisov hasn\u2019t repeated the Greek scenario. Greece first resolved historical disputes with its Macedonian partners, including the issue of imitation monuments in Skopje, for example, the monument to Alexander the Great (according to the Prespa Agreement, monuments to the family of Alexander the Great should have signs explaining that the monuments belong to ancient history, which belongs to Greece), and only then gave the green light for Northern Macedonia\u2019s Euro-Atlantic integration. The Bulgarian government first signed an agreement (on friendship, good neighbourliness and cooperation) promising to show historical tolerance to historical truth, and then waited for adequate steps from Northern Macedonia. Unfortunately, such steps didn\u2019t follow and probably won\u2019t follow. The problem is that the current government, trying to please Brussels and remain in power, may not use our right to veto Northern Macedonia\u2019s entering the EU. I am convinced that most Bulgarians would consider such steps (no veto) national treason.\n\nSputnik: At the online EU-Western Balkans summit in early May, there was no question of the date of the start of negotiations on Northern Macedonia and Albania\u2019s joining the EU, although back in 2018, Jean-Claude Juncker said that the Balkan candidates could consider 2025 as the date of their possible accession to the European Union, as soon as they fulfilled the necessary conditions. Do you think the situation with COVID-19 and the economic recession will alienate the prospects for Balkan countries\u2019 joining the EU? Which country do you think is the most promising candidate, Serbia, Montenegro or Albania?\n\nRumen Gechev: Covid-19 will undoubtedly slow down the process of Albania, Northern Macedonia and Montenegro\u2019s accession to the EU. At this stage, due to a variety of reasons, the issue of Serbia is out of the question. A slowdown is inevitable due to the fact that the EU doesn\u2019t think about expansion. It has to deal with very serious economic and political problems in order to pay more attention to the periphery in the Balkans. The differences between the western and eastern EU countries are still significant. Brussels has serious political disagreements with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland over the judicial system, migrant problems, the Istanbul Convention, their unwillingness to join the Eurozone, and so on. The EU is literally in a fever of problems, and Albania, Northern Macedonia and Montenegro\u2019s accession is likely to make the situation even worse. In addition, two Balkan EU members, Greece and Bulgaria, have their own \u201cpreferences.\u201d Greece would like to support Montenegro, while Bulgaria would prefer Northern Macedonia to Albania and Montenegro. First of all, you need to see whether the Eurozone can withstand the crisis and whether the EC finds a clear path and tools to continue building a common European home. Before that, there are unlikely to be any real steps to accept new members.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik \/ Sergei Guneev Russian President Vladimir Putin Speaking at the launching ceremony of TurkStream pipeline\n\nSputnik: You have repeatedly called for lifting anti-Russia sanctions, indicating that of the EU member states, Bulgaria suffered the most from these economic measures. You also noted that at the same time, countries like Germany maintain economic relations with Russia, participating in the Nord Stream-2 project, while Bulgaria has buried the South Stream. In your opinion, can Turkstream somehow make up for these losses? Can it be that maybe the post-coronavirus era and the economic difficulties that accompany it are a good reason to lift various restrictive measures?\n\nRumen Gechev: Yes, both in our parliament and in the media I expressed the opinion that serving foreign economic interests entailed huge economic losses; we missed out on exceptional advantages. Because gas pipelines shouldn\u2019t be seen only as transit fees sources, even if it is several hundred million euros per year. They would provide the economy with a stable supply (of energy resources) at preferential prices. After the failure of South Stream, we still have the opportunity to connect to the Turkstream, which our Prime Minister somewhat guilty calls \u201cBalkan\u201d. But no matter how we call it, we will now need to pay transit fees and margins to Turkey; but it could have been the other way around. It\u2019s clear that the current Bulgarian government will strongly support anti-Russia sanctions so that it remains in power. For several consecutive years, nuclear reactors for Belene NPPs have been stored in a warehouse, almost two billion euros have been invested (in 2018, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences published a report on Belene, saying that Bulgaria had invested 3 billion levs, or about \u20ac1.54 billion). And while the Czech Republic and Hungary expand the possibilities of using peaceful atomic energy with the help of Rosatom, our authorities still keep frozen billions in a promising investment project, a project that would provide Bulgarian companies and households with clean electricity at competitive prices. One can only hope that COVID-19 will bring something positive to relations between the EU and Russia. Looking at the development of macroeconomic indicators, the approaching mass bankruptcies and problems in banks, I think that pressure from EU members regarding sanctions lifting will only increase. The statements of the political leaders of Germany, France and Italy are encouraging in this direction. Lifting the sanctions would simplify the restructuring and adaptation of our economy to new conditions, as well as allow the completion of significant and, I would say, pained Bulgarian-Russian investment projects.\n\nRumen Gechev is a Bulgarian MP from the Bulgarian Socialist Party, Deputy Chairman of the budget commission and member of the economic policy commission.

(1)\n\nResearch indicates nucleotide similarity between SARS-COVs, MERS-CoVs and SARS-CoV02 which suggests a high genetic homology. With infection severe inflammatory and immune response may activate a cytokine storm such as apoptosis of epithelial cells and endothelial cells leading to vascular leakage and abnormal T-cell and macrophage responses that could induce ALI\/ARDS and even death. This storm appears to be prevalent in those with COVID-19 based on genetic homology and pathologic features of infected lungs, and in the blood there is a marked increase of inflammatory markers IL-1B, IFN-y, IP-10, MCp-1, IL-4 and Il-10. Those with COVID-19 also present with suppressed immune function that is marked by hypo-albuminemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and a decreased percentage of CD8+ T-cells. The excessive inflammation, depressed immunity, and cytokine storm appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. (1,2,3,6)\n\nDue to the antiviral, antioxidant, and immune enhancing properties melatonin has been shown to help reduce viremia, paralysis, and death in mice infected with encephalitis and it has led to the downregulation of acute lung oxidative injury, proinflammatory cytokine release and inflammatory cell recruitment in respiratory syncytial virus models. Findings support possible use of melatonin in treatment of viral diseases, additionally the actions of melatonin support has potential attenuation for COVID-19 infection.(1,4,5)\n\nThe anti-inflammatory effects are exerted through various pathways such as suppressing NF-kB activation in ARDS and downregulating NF-kN activation in T-cells and lung tissues. It also stimulates NF-E3 related factor 2 which is important in protecting against lung, liver, and cardiovascular injury. Melatonin has been shown to help reduce production of the cytokines and chemokines TNF-a, IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 which are involved in inflammation. (1,9,10,11)\n\nNLRP3 is part of the innate immune response during lung infection that is activated by viruses to amplify inflammation. It is correlated to lung disease caused by infection and melatonin has been shown to be efficacious at inhibiting NLRP3 mediated lung injury by reducing inflammation of macrophages and neutrophils in lung tissues. (1,7,8)\n\nMelatonin enhances immune response by improving proliferation and maturation of natural killer cells, T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes; in macrophages antigen presentation is augmented after the application of melatonin including the upregulation of complement receptor 3, MHC class I and class II, as well as CD4 antigens. (1,12)\n\nAlthough there are no studies related to the use of melatonin in the treatment of COVID-19 its use has been shown to be promising in other diseases with increased levels of inflammation. Doses of 5 mg\/d and 25 mg\/d have been shown to decrease serum levels of IL-6, TBF-a, and hs-C reactive protein in those with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis, as well as promoting reductions in serum concentrations of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1B and lipoproteins with MS. Melatonin intake of 5-10 mg\/d has also been shown to decrease many of the same inflammatory cytokines that are being seen in COVID-19. (1,13,14,15)\n\nEven at higher doses the short term use of melatonin has been deemed safe, but while their safety has been verified in human studies its effects when given to those with COVID-19 remains unknown and should be monitored closely.\n\nAnimal models and human studies have continuously documented the efficacy and safety of melatonin. Those with viral infection or those dealing with inflammation based chronic conditions possible may benefit from melatonin. Thus melatonin testing could reveal the baseline status of this anti-inflammatory and immune modulating hormone to provide a framework for its supplementation.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":912,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/policing\/2020\/05\/14\/what-prisons-look-like-after-covid-19-pandemic-column\/3046609001\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Ashish Prashar']","title":"COVID-19 is forcing the release of some inmates.

If our system was more justice oriented and less punitive, we wouldn\u2019t now be scrambling for so many compassionate releases.\n\nGetting \u201ctough on crime\u201d was supposed to rehabilitate society, clear it of repetitively malignant socioeconomic outcomes across communities and create a permanent feeling of safety. Instead it has done nothing but overcrowd prisons, making each a petri dish for COVID-19. This explosive combination of unnecessarily high incarceration rates and a global pandemic accelerates the need to create a better, more holistic approach to justice in America.\n\nIn the wake of COVID-19 and tightening state and federal budgets, there is an opportunity for significant nationwide expansion of alternatives to incarceration and detention, and impactful reform of the justice system.\n\nCOLUMN:Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching\n\nHere are three changes that could fundamentally redefine our criminal justice system: practicing restorative justice, implementing misdemeanor reform and passing legislation that would eliminate punishment for parole violations.\n\nRestorative justice, not punitive justice\n\nPunitive justice focuses primarily on punishments. Restorative justice focuses on the relationship between the offender and the victim and centers the needs of survivors in ways that the traditional court system does not.\n\nPrograms based on this approach are being used right now in youth courts, such as the Red Hook Community Justice Center and Harlem Community Justice Center, and by Impact Justice\u2019s Restorative Justice Project. The work interrupts the cycle of offending, repairs harm caused to the victim and the community, and incorporates restorative healing circles.\n\nRestorative justice programs have higher survivor satisfaction rates than punitive systems.\n\nPrograms like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion in Seattle are also important. The program partners civilians with local police to divert offenders to needed resources without making an arrest.\n\nMisdemeanor reforms\n\nMisdemeanors make the U.S. criminal justice system a profit center. They make up 80% of state criminal dockets, putting throngs of people into U.S. jails and prisons.\n\nCOLUMN:During COVID-19 crisis, prioritize release of pregnant inmates\n\nMisdemeanors vary in severity from jaywalking to unpaid parking tickets and third-degree assault. While the latter may need stronger consequences, facing jail time for not being able to pay a speeding ticket or jaywalking isn\u2019t just.\n\nMisdemeanor shouldn't be done away with, but our justice system must enforce appropriate consequences for offenses rather than disproportionate punishments.\n\nDon't arrest for parole violations\n\nPassing legislation that would eliminate parole violations would go a long way toward keeping people out of prisons and jails who don't belong there.\n\nNew York City's Less is More Act is a great example of how to get that done. The act, if passed, would eliminate technical parole violations. The state's taxpayers spent million of dollars last year incarcerating folks for technical parole violations.

According to this letter: \u201cIt is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C Sec. 41 et seq. to advertise that a product or service can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.

To All Our Health! ~DrB\n\nThe articles we have published on our website authored by Dr. Brownstein remain, and are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, as a licensed physician, Dr. Brownstein has stricter regulations on what he can publish since he charges for his services.\n\nThis does NOT mean he has done anything wrong or illegal, it just probably means he has neither the time nor resources to fight this in court right now, where he would probably win on Constitutional grounds.\n\nThis was one of Dr. Brownstein\u2019s last blog entries regarding the wearing of masks, which criticized Governor Whitmer (which is NOT illegal!).\n\nWe Must Wear Face Masks? Show Me the Science Behind That!\n\nby Dr. Brownstein\n\nFolks, I have been writing to you about COVID for over a month. It is been a painful time period for all of us.\n\nWhat is really sad is that too many political dictates are being fostered on us without any good scientific evidence to back them up. One of those requirements that has me irritated is the use of face coverings that I see so prevalent out there.\n\nWhen I go to Costco, 95% of the people in the store are wearing face masks.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe Governor of Michigan recently released an edict requiring that citizens wear a face covering when in any enclosed public space.\n\nIt specifically states, \u201cAny individual able to medically tolerate a face covering must wear a covering over his or her nose and mouth\u2014such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandana, or handkerchief\u2014when in any enclosed public space.\u201d\n\nLater in the edict, it states, \u201cSupplies of N95 masks and surgical masks should generally be reserved, for now, for health care professionals, first responders and other critical workers who interact with the public.\u201d\n\nIt should be well known that cloth masks, bandanas, or handkerchiefs will do very little to stop the spread of coronavirus. In fact, they may actually increase your risk of becoming ill from corona and other influenza-like illnesses.\n\nA 2015 study found cloth masks, when compared to surgical masks, increase the rate of influenza-like illnesses 13x! (1) Cloth masks are probably best avoided and should not be reused without properly sanitizing them.\n\nRegular surgical masks are not much better in this situation. The COVID-19 virus is 0.125 \u00b5m in size. Surgical masks have been shown to not adequately filter against aerosols measuring from 0.9-3.1 \u00b5m. (2)\n\nOther researchers have shown that particles from 0.04-0.2 \u00b5m can penetrate surgical masks. (3)\n\nA 2020 study in Seoul, South Korea looked at the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in blocking COVID-19 in a controlled comparison of four patients. (4)\n\nThe COVID-infected patients were put in negative pressure isolated rooms. The scientists compared disposable surgical masks (3 layers) with reusable cotton masks.\n\nPatients were instructed to cough 5 times while wearing no mask, surgical mask, or cotton mask. Interestingly, all swabs from the outer masks\u2014including surgical masks\u2014were positive for COVID-19.\n\nInner masks were also found to be contaminated. That means the mask did not effectively filter out the COVID virus since it is too small. The authors state, \u201cNeither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered {COVID-19} during coughs by infected patients.\u201d\n\nThe study also reported greater contamination on the outer than the inner mask (both surgical and cotton) surfaces.\n\nThe authors claim that the mask is either allowing the virus to cross from the inner to the outer surface because the virus is too small or the aerodynamic feature of a mask could explain this finding. A turbulent jet due to air leakage around the mask edge could contaminate the outer surface.\n\nWe have made far too many political decisions in the COVID crisis based on fear and not on reliable data. Here is a perfect example of another one: everyone must wear a mask when inside any public place.\n\nShould you wear a mask? If you are coughing or sick, my answer is yes. A surgical mask, and to a lesser extent a cotton mask, will block large droplets from being spread.\n\nHowever, should we dictate to healthy people that they are required to wear a mask\u2014cotton or surgical\u2014when in any public enclosed space? Someone show me the science supporting the Executive Order by the Governor of Michigan. And Governor Whitmer wonders why so many of us are annoyed.\n\nTo All Our Health,\n\n~DrB\n\nAddendum: A further annoyance is my lack of success in getting masks\u2014both N95 and surgical masks\u2013 for my staff to use when we are treating COVID patients. Perhaps the Governor should release an executive order helping us get the PPE equipment we need. We have had masks, gowns and face shields on order for over two months. That is beyond annoying.\n\n(1) BMJ Open. 2015:5:e006577.\n\n(2) Am. J Infect. Contol. 2008:36:276-282\n\n(3) Ann.Occup. Hyg. 2008:52:177-85\n\n(4) Annals of Int. Med. Letter. IBID.

The companies whose orders FedEx has capped include Belk, Abercrombie & Fitch, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Eddie Bauer, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Hobby Lobby, and DSW.\n\n\"These customers have seen significant volume growth since the spread of Covid-19,\" FedEx told Ground workers in a memo leaked to the Journal. \"In a time of already high volume growth, capping the number of packages to be picked up at these locations will limit any negative impacts to the FedEx Ground network.\"\n\nA FedEx spokesperson told Business Insider these limits are similar to what the company mandates around Christmas time, ensuring reliable service. The company is working directly with large retailers with unusually-high volume to ensure goods are getting out on time.\n\nSome customers are directly passing their goods to a their closest-by FedEx Ground facility to bypass hub sortation, the spokesperson added. The parcel giant has also increased Sunday delivery, and, in certain locations, hiring.\n\nAmericans are now buying (nonessential) stuff online\n\nEarlier this year, Americans shifted to buying household goods, groceries, and essential supplies online. Online sales of hand sanitizer jumped by 228% in the US during the four weeks ending on March 7, compared to the same period last year, according to retail sales tracker Nielsen.\n\nAdobe Analytics said a 100% increase in online grocery orders in mid March drove a 25% uptick in overall online orders, compared to a period earlier in the month.\n\nBut as the government-mandated shutdowns from the coronavirus have endured, people are starting to buy more and more of those less essential goods that retailers like Nordstrom or DSW might hawk.\n\n\"It went from people trying to stock up and maybe buying a little bit more than they needed to understanding that things are OK, I can move beyond the basics of food and shelter,\" Jaimee Minney, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at market-research firm Rakuten Intelligence, told CNBC.\n\nRakuten Intelligence found for the first half of April, compared to the first half of March, Americans bought nearly nine times as many books, nearly three times as many toys and games, and more than twice as many sports and outdoors items. Purchases of beauty products upticked by 38%.\n\nMeanwhile, those who are seeing their states reopen may start to consider the ensembles they may need for garden parties or weddings, suggested a recent white paper from Pinterest.\n\nThe shift to online is whelming UPS, FedEx, and Amazon\n\nAmericans have shifted to ordering more online for years, but the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating that. Sales online popped by 49% in April, according to Adobe Analytics.\n\nAnd while an unexpected deluge of packages may buoy delivery companies, the FedEx shipping cap shows it's also disruptive to normal business activities. UPS and Amazon have seen disruptions, too.\n\nUPS said it delivered 19% more packages to homebound Americans in the first three months of 2020 compared to last year. But the increase in residential over commercial deliveries ended up eroding UPS' margins.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon was forced to halt all third-party package shipments last month, and had to ban warehouse deliveries of nonessential goods in March.\n\nMany experts believe that increase will stick. As a result, parcel giants must now piece together how to deliver more boxes on doorsteps than ever before.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing that we have seen is an explosion in e-commerce due to the physical store closures,\" Brie Carere, FedEx chief marketing and communications officer, told eMarketer. \"If we thought e-commerce was growing faster before, we're going to see even greater acceleration.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":923,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/us-british-fighter-pilots-first-point-blank-exercise-amid-coronavirus-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Master Sgt.

My credit rating is going down the tubes. Thirty years, 650 square feet \u2014 it\u2019s my life,\u201d he said.\n\nBall said he\u2019s waiting on word from other grants and loans he has applied for, but believes larger operators are in line ahead of him. \u201cThe government has to make some corrections in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have driven all the blue-collar jobs overseas. That\u2019s why we have a high rate of crime. There\u2019s just no opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe grantees were selected by lottery from more than 4,500 applications, Escareno said. With help from five community organizations, the city vetted and picked recipients a week after the application period closed for the Microbusiness Recovery Grant Program. Escareno said all recipients will have the money in hand by Friday.\n\nMoney for the program came from the Chicago Community Trust, which continues to raise money for COVID-19 relief. Escareno said demand was so high, the grant program may be reopened to consider more applicants.\n\n\u201cFrom family-owned coffee shops to mom-and-pop retail stores, our microbusinesses are the beating heart of our communities and local economy,\u201d Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. \u201cWith the Microbusiness Recovery Grant Program, we are putting much-needed relief into the hands of nearly 1,000 of Chicago\u2019s most-impacted local entrepreneurs so that we can reinvigorate communities on our road to recovery.\u201d\n\nOfficials said that more than two-thirds of grantees reported in a survey that they have not received other emergency funding. To be eligible, businesses must have had four or fewer employees, annual revenue of less than $250,000 and be located within a low- or moderate-income community area.\n\nMore than 90% of the recipients were businesses headed by women, African Americans or Latinos, city officials said. On average, businesses getting the grants have been open for more than 10 years, they said.\n\nAld. Emma Mitts (37th) called the grants a \u201ccritical lifeline\u201d to local businesses. \u201cIn less than two weeks, the city established a first-of-its-kind emergency grant program and is now putting those relief funds directly into the hands of our community entrepreneurs,\u201d Mitts said.\n\nThe program is in addition to loans available under the city\u2019s $100 million Small Business Resiliency Fund. Officials said the resiliency fund has approved 316 loans for nearly $12 million, with another 268 loans totaling $9.5 million in the final stages of underwriting.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":935,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/coronavirus-layoffs-furloughs-hospitality-service-travel-unemployment-2020","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Taylor Borden']","title":"The coronavirus outbreak has triggered unprecedented mass layoffs and furloughs.

Previously, the youngest known victim was a 19-year-old man from Riverdale, who died April 10.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, state officials announced the death of a 9-month-old infant that they attributed to COVID, but that death remains under investigation by the Cook County Medical Examiner and has never been officially determined to be caused by the virus.\n\nWill the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously?\n\nI doubt it.\n\nEven now, I know someone is reading this and saying \u201cbut children die all the time,\u201d and that is true. Children die all the time, and I realize more of them have died of something other than COVID-19 in the two months we\u2019ve been in lockdown.\n\nStill, what if he\u2019s just the first child to die as the disease continues to spread, indeed if it accelerates as we accommodate the desires of those who want to visit their favorite bars and restaurants, or more to the point, the more understandable desire for the owners of those businesses to try to make money again?\n\nThere are other vulnerable children. Do we sacrifice them for the sake of the economy, knowing that the financial crisis will take its own toll?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer to that. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to take the risk just yet, but it\u2019s easy for me to say, my family still secure and everyone drawing a paycheck.\n\nSometime in the last two months, Ernesto\u2019s family moved from the Gage Park home to Indiana, neighbors said. A \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign hung Thursday in the window.\n\nIn fact, the neighbors did not know Ernesto\u2019s name, not even the children who lived across the street, because Ernesto did not come out and play with the other children, apparently because of his health.\n\nA GoFundMe page that was opened Thursday to support his family showed Ernesto in a white suit at church. First communion maybe? Sorry, I don\u2019t know my religious rituals. But I see a sweet boy.\n\nOfficials from Marquez Elementary issued a statement saying they were heartbroken to learn of his death.\n\n\u201cErnesto was a cherished member of the Marquez community joining our family in Kindergarten through most of his sixth-grade year. Although he and his family recently relocated, he was still one of our Marshals and kept in close touch with his Marquez friends and teachers. He was a special member of our school community.\u201d\n\n\u201cErnesto loved Fortnite, art projects, science experiments, jokes and riddles, spending time with friends, and is remembered for being an incredibly sweet and loving confidant to everyone he met. We love Ernesto and will miss him with our whole heart.\u201d\n\nI reached a family member by phone. Through her tears, she said she did not speak English.\n\nThe man who came on the line next said politely: \u201cWe have no comment at this time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll have to let their GoFundMe page do the talking.\n\nSince his first surgery for Charcot-Marie-Tooth, Ernesto \u201chas been fighting for his life with his strong spirit,\u201d it states.\n\n\u201cWhile he may have been taken from us at such a young age, we will never forget the importance of unity and family he valued so much. He was constantly surrounded by love and happiness, and we know he\u2019s made an impact on anyone he\u2019s met.\u201d\n\nTake this seriously, folks. Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":950,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/coronavirus-investing-survey-fund-manager-strategy-bets-risks-hidden-gems-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Rebecca Ungarino']","title":"10 big money managers shared with us their favorite hidden gems in the market, and the contrarian trades they're making amid the pandemic","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5eb950c55f726e6df76ff084?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Kera Van Valen, senior research analyst and portfolio manager of Epoch Investment Partners' equity shareholder yield strategies: \"While they may temporarily suspend buybacks, [companies] with strong balance sheets and ongoing cash flows will continue paying dividends.\"\n\nCrystal Cox\/Business Insider\n\n1. Which investments would you call under-the-radar opportunities right now?\n\nMany investors, whether they are pension funds or retirees, need income.\n\nAnd bonds, which used to be the cornerstone of an income-generating portfolio, just aren't delivering unless you venture out on the risk spectrum.\n\nOne can generate a much higher level of income today from a portfolio on high-quality dividend paying stocks. And unlike bond coupons, dividends from stocks can grow over time.\n\n2. What is your most contrarian, or surprising, market call in this environment?\n\nWe are seeing pressure on companies to halt buybacks and dividend payments, and some will be forced to do just that, especially if they benefit from government assistance.\n\nBut dividends are an important part of thoughtful capital allocation. If a company has excess cash that it has no place to invest for a return above its cost of capital, it's prudent to return that capital to shareholders. Otherwise, they are destroying value.\n\nOur view is that well-managed companies will not abandon sound capital allocation policies. While they may temporarily suspend buybacks, those with strong balance sheets and ongoing cash flows will continue paying dividends.\n\n3. Name one stock or investment you're most bullish on right now.\n\nOur approach is not to find some rare gem with undiscovered value. We look for a diversified group of stocks where we have a high degree of confidence they will pay and grow dividends.\n\nHere's one of them: Watsco, the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies in North America. It has a history of returning cash to shareholders, having paid a quarterly dividend since 2009.\n\nThey are also making significant investments in technology. A lot of companies are talking about ecommerce and mobile apps; however, most investors don't associate technology with HVAC equipment distributors.\n\n4. What is one risk within the market you feel investors are missing?\n\nIn a time like this, active management is essential for an income-oriented equity portfolio.\n\nCompanies that have been buying back shares and paying dividends while piling up debt are in for a rough period. For a portfolio to provide sustained income, companies need to be vetted for the ability to pay dividends that are covered by sustainable and growing cash flows, and for shareholder-friendly management.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":959,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/politics\/2020\/5\/14\/21258621\/barack-obama-2020-presidential-race-donald-trump-coronavirus-response-joe-biden-election","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":[],"title":"Obama emerges as central figure in 2020 presidential race","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/n8vDEOxm2Ltts6b9QJoT1u3Fb_4=\/0x0:3153x1651\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19970390\/1209892126.jpg.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president.

As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he\u2019s also running to restore some of the former president\u2019s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America\u2019s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump\u2019s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately \u201cunmasking\u201d Flynn\u2019s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump\u2019s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.\n\nDespite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it \u201cObamagate.\u201d He\u2019s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: \u201cWhat did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.\n\nTrump\u2019s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president\u2019s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign drew a direct connection between the president\u2019s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,\u201d said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.\n\nTrump\u2019s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ\u2019s decision to drop the Flynn case put the \u201crule of law at risk.\u201d He also criticized the Trump White House\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign\u2019s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.\n\nThough Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He\u2019s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.\n\nBut the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he\u2019s told advisers he\u2019s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.\n\nObama\u2019s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":960,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/kiwis-vs-coronavirus-new-zealand-covid19-restrictions-rules\/","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-14","author":"['Konstantin Richter']","title":"How New Zealand beat the coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/GettyImages-1222697010-1200x628.jpg","body_text":"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":968,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/15\/21258490\/coronavirus-vaccines-hiv-prep-protection-malaria-drugs-plasma","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Nicole Wetsman']","title":"An HIV-fighting strategy might help against COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/9DeU8Qw-K0rTAsKzZBerevbCJcw=\/0x371:5184x3085\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19970272\/1221347617.jpg.jpg","body_text":"Though many people are pinning their hopes on a COVID-19 vaccine, another option is available: preventive treatment. At a Senate hearing this week, Anthony Fauci noted that a vaccine \u2014 which is probably months or years away \u2014 isn\u2019t the only way to protect someone from a life-threatening virus.\n\nThese treatments could protect people against infection for a few weeks or months, said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. While most ongoing research studies are focused on finding treatments for people who are already sick with COVID-19, some researchers are looking to see if they can stop people who are at high risk from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s a proven strategy: preventive drugs have been used for decades to help people protect themselves against malaria. More recently, they were a breakthrough in the fight against HIV. There\u2019s no effective vaccine against HIV, but people can take a daily medication that reduces their risk of contracting it through sexual activity by 99 percent. The medication is a pre-exposure prophylactic, or PrEP \u2014 a drug used to prevent disease in people who haven\u2019t yet been exposed to it.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredibly powerful tool that can, for myself personally, protect me from HIV,\u201d says James Krellenstein, co-founder of the PrEP4All Collaboration and an organizer of a COVID-19 working group in New York.\n\nKrellenstein published a report this week outlining the clinical trials underway to find drugs that can prevent COVID-19. Viruses make people sick when they replicate and spread through the body, and most anti-viral drugs are designed to stop that replication process. Giving someone the drug early, when there\u2019s only a small number of virus particles in the body, is going to be more effective than waiting until the virus is everywhere, Caleb Skipper, an infectious disease postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota, told The Verge. In theory, a drug could be even more effective if it\u2019s already in the body when the first virus appears.\n\nSkipper is part of a research team at the University of Minnesota running a clinical trial to see if hydroxychloroquine, which can stop the coronavirus from replicating in a test tube, can help keep health care workers from catching COVID-19. The drug has been the subject of a lot of controversy and hasn\u2019t been able to effectively treat people who are already sick and hospitalized.\n\nOngoing enrollment for Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trial for high risk healthcare workers and first responders anywhere in the US (and parts of Canada soon). https:\/\/t.co\/zDhgb307LQ #MedTwitter pic.twitter.com\/s5ZFXA7JqL \u2014 David Boulware, MD MPH (@boulware_dr) May 5, 2020\n\nThe majority of clinical trials looking at preventive drugs now are testing hydroxychloroquine, Krellenstein found. He argues that research into prophylactics needs to cast a wider net and look at other candidates, too. \u201cVaccines are much an art as a science, and there\u2019s a lot of hit and miss. It would be substantial if we could identify a molecular compound that could really inhibit COVID-19 acquisition,\u201d he says.\n\nSome researchers are looking outside of hydroxychloroquine. At Johns Hopkins, researchers are testing to see if convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich blood of COVID-19 survivors, could be protective. A trial testing how well it protects people who have been exposed to the novel coronavirus from becoming sick will start enrolling participants next week.\n\n\u201cYou could imagine everyone in a meatpacking plant could get this. You could imagine everyone in the White House could get this, people at high risk,\u201d says David Sullivan, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, who\u2019s involved in the plasma research. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for those critical people to get immediate immunity.\u201d\n\nThe trial will test if the plasma confers protection, and if it does, how long it might last. \u201cPlasma is a single dose \u2014 you could go in and get it once and have protection for a month, or six weeks,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWe think that this is one of the essential steps to returning us to a functioning society. But we have to demonstrate that it works.\u201d\n\nIf plasma helps prevent COVID-19, it could be a sign that more refined antibody treatments might also be useful as protection, he says. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to identify the antibodies that are most effective at blocking the novel coronavirus. Then, they\u2019d be able to produce a more targeted cocktail of virus-blocking substances than plasma, which is a general mix of all the antibodies a sick person\u2019s body creates. \u201cConvalescent plasma is the first step towards other products,\u201d Sullivan says.\n\nBoth plasma and antibodies typically require IV infusions, so the logistics of providing them to people at risk of contracting COVID-19 is challenging \u2014 although it may only need to be given once to confer some level of protection. Hydroxychloroquine is a pill, so it\u2019s simpler for people to take, but may have to be taken daily.\n\nSullivan thinks that the limitations aren\u2019t insurmountable. And identifying drugs that can protect people from the novel coronavirus is a critical step toward controlling the pandemic, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck treating people who are sick. That has to be done,\u201d Sullivan says. But the best way to help people is to keep them from getting sick in the first place. It could also help them feel safer leaving the house. \u201cIf I have a treatment that shortens hospitalization, I\u2019m still going to worry about going out and about, if it means I might have to go to the hospital,\u201d he says.\n\nTreatments are important, Sullivan says, but they help put out fires that are already raging. \u201cProphylaxis is like throwing water on a box of matches,\u201d he says. \u201cWet matches aren\u2019t going to light in the first place.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":972,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/premise-health-playbook-for-reopening-offices-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Lydia Ramsey']","title":"A health clinic company that helped essential businesses stay open during the pandemic shares a 27-page playbook for bringing workers back to the office","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5ebc438857853219495dc295?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Premise Health, the largest operator of onsite clinics in the US, built a playbook to help employers safely bring their employees back to the office amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe 27-page guide walks through recommendations about how to return to the office, as well as important considerations about which employees might return and when conversations around coming back can begin to happen.\n\nPremise President Jami Doucette told Business Insider the reason to compile the playbook was that the healthcare company itself was facing the question of \"How do we bring our own folks back?\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThroughout the coronavirus pandemic, Premise Health couldn't let some of of its employees work from home.\n\nPremise is the largest operator of onsite clinics in the US, and the company's workers are essential nurses and doctors.\n\nThe same was true for some of the company's clients.

But it believes it can help scan more patients now during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nCOVID-19 patients with heart problems suffer worse outcomes, said Dr. Christopher Moore, an emergency physician at Yale New Haven Hospital.\n\nCaption's software makes it easier for nurses or frontline to do these heart scans, which can help identify high-risk COVID-19 patients.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nMany people view the coronavirus as an accelerant for business trends that were already happening.\n\nWhile healthcare has been notoriously slow in adapting to the digital world, the virus has sped up some of the efforts, such as an explosion in telehealth.\n\nThe virus also accelerated plans for the artificial-intelligence startup Caption Health. Brisbane, California-based Caption announced this week that its AI software to scan hearts was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, just 25 days after the company submitted it to US regulators. An earlier version won clearance in February.\n\nThe approval allows hospitals to start using the software now in the fight against COVID-19. CEO Andy Page said eight hospitals \u2014including Northwestern, University of Chicago, and ChristianaCare \u2014 are using the software, and he hopes to double that figure by the end of June.\n\nPage joined Caption in 2018, aiming to transition the company from research and development to commercial stage. He previously was president at 23andMe, a personal genetics company, and a C-suite exec at Livongo, a digital health company.\n\nPage said he was anticipating a commercial launch of the software in August, but now plans to do so sooner. The company has about 65 employees and is growing rapidly, he said.\n\nCaption was founded in 2013, and has raised $20 million to date from investors include Kholsa Ventures.

And researchers are still figuring out the relationship between COVID-19 and the heart \u2014 the disease may cause or exacerbate heart issues in some people.\n\n\"It's very clear that patients with pre-existing cardiac problems do more poorly when they have COVID,\" said Dr. Christopher Moore, an emergency physician at Yale New Haven Hospital. More research is needed to figure out if the disease can cause heart problems on its own, he added.\n\nMoore has no financial ties to Caption Health, but wrote a letter to the FDA supporting approval of the software.\n\nProactively identifying high-risk patients could help doctors keep closer tabs on them for severe complications. Heart ultrasounds can detect these patients, but also require technical training to administer.\n\n\"Ultrasound is a very powerful technology, but it's difficult,\" Moore said in an interview.\n\nScanning the heart requires taking several images with an ultrasound, sent by a probe that shoots a beam of sound through the chest. It can be challenging to get good images of the beating heart, especially if the devices aren't used by an experienced operator.\n\nCaption's software allows people without these skills to perform cardiac ultrasounds anyway.

Bolsonaro, who, like President Trump, is a booster of the antimalarial drug that has shown poor results treating COVID-19 in clinical trials, had fired Teich\u2019s predecessor less than a month ago amid a debate over whether Brazil should institute social distancing practices.\n\nWhile Bolsonaro, like Trump, is urging citizens to return to normal life, Brazil is now recording more than 800 deaths per day, the New York Times reported.

Meanwhile, even in the fourth month of US outbreaks, confusion persists about how new testing methodologies and treatments will be deployed.\n\nThe experts, who were not identified by SVB Leerink, were particularly worried about rural and urban disparities in testing the effects as stay-at-home orders are lifted, according to the summary.\n\nOne expert is \"deeply worried\" that the US will return back to where it started, as the positive test rate is still high in several areas that plan to loosen restrictions, according to the summary.\n\nThe experts \"are concerned that once the social distance measures are relaxed there will be a surging number of infected cases,\" the Leerink analysts wrote.\n\nNew York is looking to partially reopen starting May 15, based on a set of criteria used to evaluate outbreaks at the local level. Similarly, California released reopening guidelines last week for counties and businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, testing and tracing capabilities as a whole \"still seem shorthanded,\" particularly in rural areas, according to the experts. As reported by The Atlantic last week, the US needs to double or triple its daily testing, but the federal government has no plans to support that increase.\n\nThe experts also believe further research is required to address a number of questions about COVID-19's manifestation, duration of immunity, and the role of children in its transmission.\n\nHere are 5 key takeaways from the report.\n\nThe role of children in transmission is still unknown\n\nIt's still not clear whether children play a major role in coronavirus transmission, according to the experts. For other respiratory diseases like the flu, children are known to be \"major drivers for community transmission,\" the report said.\n\nBut in those cases, children tend to develop severe symptoms compared to their adult counterparts, which isn't true for COVID-19. Meanwhile, such a small group of symptomatic coronavirus cases in children makes them difficult to study, the experts told SVB Leerink.\n\nContact tracing is a method by which public health officials work with a sick patient to find everyone they've come into contact with. One expert told Leerink that the logic is straightforward, but the logistics are not.\n\nFor 100 coronavirus cases per day, for example, and 10-15 contacts for each case, up to 300 tracing workers with 40-hour work weeks are needed, according to the summary. States like New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts are all planning to hire or hiring contact tracers, they said.\n\nStill a long way to national testing\n\nTesting underpins all other health and economic measures meant to combat the virus, the experts told SVB Leerink. Today, it's not coordinated at a national level, leading to \"significant variability\" among different geographic regions, according to the report.\n\nUntil testing infrastructure is \"formalized,\" country-wide reopening will be problematic, they said.\n\nCurrent coronavirus tests aren't always accurate\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to get faulty antibody tests off the market, but their accuracy is still wide-ranging. One expert pointed out that tests relying on pinpricks tend to perform worse than those relying on blood draws analyzed in laboratories.\n\nMitigation efforts alone will not end the pandemic\n\nWhile social distancing helps, and more people could potentially gain immunity, the only thing that will truly stop the virus in its tracks is a vaccine, according to the experts.\n\n\"We will ultimately need vaccination (or a large number of infection cases) in combination with social distancing to contain spread and allow some return to our usual activities,\" the summary said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":985,"url":"https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/democrats-say-the-worst-of-the-coronavirus-is-yet-to-come-republicans-say-the-worst-is-over\/","publisher":"FiveThirtyEight","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Dhrumil Mehta']","title":"Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.","image":"https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/0515_POLLA-16x9-1.png?w=575","body_text":"Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.\n\nWelcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nSo far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post\/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it\u2019s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.\n\nAccording to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov\/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, \u201cWe are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,\u201d which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.\n\nThe polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post\/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month\u2019s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week\u2019s YouGov\/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality \u2014 including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats \u2014 believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.\n\nConcerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.\n\nAnd the share of Americans who say they\u2019re concerned about the virus\u2019s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same \u2014 hovering at around 87 percent \u2014 for the past six weeks.\n\nThe share of Americans who approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he\u2019s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.\n\nAttitudes toward Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however \u2014 according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials\u2019 work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.\n\nHowever, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places \u2014 despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they\u2019re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn\u2019t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nAccording to a Morning Consult\/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).\n\n71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later). A YouGov\/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was \u201csomething from nature\u201d or \u201ccreated by people, on purpose,\u201d with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.\n\nHalf of Americans said they would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn\u2019t use such a system, according to an Ipsos\/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they\u2019d be likely to use it.\n\nAn SSRS\/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.\n\nAccording to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.\n\nGeneric ballot\n\nIn our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).\n\nCheck out all the polls we\u2019ve been collecting ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nCORRECTION (May 15, 2020, 10:01 a.m.): A previous version of this article reversed President Trump\u2019s job approval numbers: 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 52.0 percent disapprove, not the other way around.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does The U.S. Have A Coronavirus Recovery Plan?","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":995,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/tips-for-interns-starting-during-coronavirus-internship-success-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Kate Macchi']","title":"I started my dream internship just as the coronavirus shut down the country.

People are still encouraged to maintain social distance, wear face masks, and wash their hands frequently.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott has defended the fast clip at which the state is resuming business, saying its death and hospitalization rates are lower than in other states of similar size, such as Florida and California, The Associated Press reported. Texas had 44,485 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,235 deaths as of Friday.\n\nSo far, Texas has conducted 623,284 coronavirus tests, which is about on par with Florida's testing but lower than California's 1.1 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nA woman at a nail salon in Austin on May 8.

Attorney General Ken Paxton censured officials in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio for enforcing restrictions that are stricter than what Abbott has implemented statewide for Texas. The cities have been threatened with lawsuits if they don't ease up, The AP reported.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a few Texas counties and cities seem to have confused recommendations with requirements and have grossly exceeded state law to impose their own will on private citizens and businesses,\" Paxton told The AP.\n\nIn El Paso, county judge Ricardo Samaniego requested that Abbott wait until the number of cases are declining and closely consider data before further lifting restrictions. He's still awaiting a reply, according to The AP, but doesn't expect it to come before Monday's announcement.\n\n\"I'm not fighting his plan; I'm fighting his timing,\" Samaniego told The AP. \"It looks like it would work for us months from now.\"\n\nAbbott, for his part, points to the fact that overflow hospitals in Dallas and Houston were never used. That's an indicator that Texas' healthcare system wasn't overwhelmed, he said.\n\nThe COVID-19 unit at Houston's United Memorial Medical Center on May 6. Carolyn Cole\/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe results of Texas' reopening \u2014 and the effects in other states \u2014 aren't yet fully known, since the coronavirus has a lag time, Fauci said in April.\n\nNew cases and hospitalizations reported today are a reflection of the coronavirus' spread two weeks ago because the average incubation period is five days, and symptoms worsen over a week or two. Then after a person gets tested, it takes a few days for results to come back, which then must be reported to local and state health authorities. If someone is hospitalized, it may take many more days before they get dangerously sick or die.\n\nThat's why the White House guidelines advise states to see a 14-day \"downward trajectory\" in cases before they reopen, The New York Times reported.\n\nIf a state's new infections aren't dropping, it could still start reopening as long as the proportion of test results that come back positive is lower than it was two weeks ago (assuming as many or more tests are administered).\n\n\"They see the decline going in, and they pat themselves on the back and say, 'Look at the good work we've done. Now we can let this happen and open up things,'\" Dennis Perrotta, a retired state epidemiologist in Texas, told The AP. \"And then we get slammed with a second peak.\"\n\nHave a news tip?

And that's the sign of love, not the sign of your typical protest. So I want to thank our great truckers. They like me, and I like them. We're working on something together.\"\n\nTrump made similar comments on a Thursday interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo as truck horns drowned out their conversation. Bartiromo clarified that the horns came from truck drivers who were protesting, and Trump pushed back.\n\n\"Well, they're not protesters,\" Trump said. \"They're supporters of me because we are getting things for the truckers, and all those great truckers that are all over the country. They're honking and they're really very thankful that I'm president frankly.\"\n\nWhy truck drivers are protesting\n\nThe truck drivers were, in fact, protesting rock-bottom rates, not celebrating Trump. Since mid-April, drivers in Texas, California, Arizona, and Washington, DC, have taken to the streets in their big rigs to demand government support.\n\nApril rates for spot-market loads \u2014 trucking jobs tendered in real time rather than through a prearranged contract \u2014 were 54% lower than in April 2019, according to data from the load-board company DAT. Rates in April fell to five-year lows for refrigerated and flatbed loads.\n\nMeanwhile, the $2 trillion stimulus bill that Trump signed into law in late March did not provide any direct support for truck drivers. Several truck drivers who applied for a loan through the Small Business Administration told Business Insider that they were not able to get funding, putting their livelihoods at risk.\n\nFor Joe Plummer, the pay to take a truckload of goods from his home base in North Carolina to Los Angeles had plummeted to $2,700 from $4,700 two months ago.\n\n\"We don't need memes and news conferences saying 'We support truckers,'\" Plummer previously told Business Insider. \"We need fuel to stay low, rates to go up, and some type of financial assistance until we recover.\"\n\nThere are nearly 2 million truck drivers in the US. About 350,000 to 400,000 of them own and operate their own trucks, while many work for small companies in need of financial assistance.\n\nCass Information Systems said April freight volumes hit levels not seen since 2009, obliterating take-home pay for drivers.\n\nTrump has pledged to help truck drivers, but some say they are just a 'political toy'\n\nWhile Trump said truck drivers loved him, their relationship has been a bit rocky in recent years. Several blamed Trump in 2019 for destroying their livelihoods as his trade war lowered US manufacturing output.\n\nTrump has rallied behind truck drivers in recent weeks. He told \"Fox & Friends\" earlier this month that truck drivers were being \"price gouged\" by the brokers who match them with retailers and manufacturers, adding that he was \"going to take care of them.\"\n\nSome drivers, however, have expressed their frustration that Trump is using them as \"a political toy.\"\n\n\"You're a political toy! Placated and being used,\" trucking activist Charles Claburn wrote on Facebook, as reported by Transportation Nation Nework. \"You leave that street (and) it's over. We need more trucks. They see us, now they need to hear us!

We've rescheduled, but the financial and emotional stress hasn't gone away.","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5eb5b501204ad3048c031683?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Countless brides who would have been walking down the aisle this spring are now scrambling to reschedule their plans and salvage their savings accounts due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJaclyn Regan of Staten Island, New York is one such bride: Her New Jersey wedding was canceled six days before it was supposed to happen in March.\n\nThe cancellation has been emotionally and financially difficult for Regan and her fianc\u00e9, Angelo Fallacaro: They lost around $3,000 and are left with now useless, date-specific decor, from champagne flutes to personalized T-shirts.\n\nThe couple has rescheduled their big day \u2014 and Regan says that compared to how others are suffering right now, they know their problems are small.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nOn March 14, one week before our wedding, a manager from the catering hall where we were about to be married called and asked how we felt about postponing.\n\nAt the time, the threat of the coronavirus was still very new, so while the outbreak was on my mind, it really hadn't been a major concern. We live in Staten Island, where at the time only one case had been confirmed. It was still too early to grasp just how devastating this virus was going to be.\n\nSo we sat down with our families, talked over our options, and scheduled a meeting at our venue \u2014 South Gate Manor in Freehold, New Jersey \u2014 for the next day.\n\nThe news wasn't great. The owner of the catering hall had already started to cancel upcoming events. Some of our wedding guests started calling to say they wouldn't be able to make it. Of course I was devastated \u2014 everything was set and ready to go, we were so close \u2014 but there was a strong possibility that Freehold Township would close down entirely, food deliveries would be delayed, and guests wouldn't be able to get to the hall.\n\nThe day was already ruined, six days before it was to happen. We realized it was only logical to postpone.\n\nReorganizing our wedding has been a bump in the road, a big one, but we're making the best of it. This virus is deadly and scary. So many people are sick and so many people have lost their jobs \u2014 I had to throw out a couple of dated items and replace a seating chart. I try to keep it in that perspective. This is obviously not how we planned things, but compared to how others are suffering, it's simply an inconvenience.\n\nIn terms of loss, we were actually in a good position. Because we were one of the first weddings to be cancelled, we had our first choice of dates to reschedule. We wanted to recoup as much as possible, so we opted for the next available Friday, which is July 17. South Gate is a big family business \u2014 the caterer's sister is his florist, his brother is a photographer \u2014 so that made the transition easier. There were just a lot of phone calls and a little bit of juggling to make sure all of the vendors could transfer their services to that date.\n\nThe limos, the DJ, and basically everyone else involved were able to make the switch. Our officiant was the only missing piece \u2014 we'll have to make a change there \u2014 but overall there wasn't major damage.\n\nSome of our flowers were already in transit, so the florist had to accept at least half upon delivery. We had 300 blush roses in our house for days; I was giving them away to friends, neighbors, anyone who would take them.\n\nSome of the blush roses that it was too late to return.. Courtesy photo\n\nThat portion of the flowers ($1,500) and the officiant fee ($500) were a complete loss. I put off estimating our overall losses for a month, basically thinking \"it is what it is,\" but after adding it all up, it's not nearly as bad as I had imagined. We're losing about $3,000, which is nothing compared to the total cost of the wedding which is around $65,000.\n\nBut there's so much that I can't put a price on.\n\nDate-specific overnight gift bags for the couple's hotel guests. Courtesy photo\n\nOur date was meaningful to me. It's engraved on my champagne flutes which are now useless. My honeymoon couldn't be salvaged. We were originally going to St. Lucia, but that was booked up in July so we've switched to Barbados. It's fine; it doesn't matter where we go \u2014 but summer flights and vacations are almost double the price of what I was paying to go away in March. That's an added expense we weren't counting on.\n\nDate-specific water bottles that will have to be redone. Courtesy photo\n\nI made dozens of overnight bags for the guests who were staying in the hotel; they were filled with personalized water bottles and other dated items which have to be scrapped. Our favors will have to be rewrapped and tagged with our new date, the personalized T-shirts my mom made will now never be worn. Our bridal party gifts were dated and have to be redone. I have everything stored in a spare room, and day by day I realize more and more things that will have to be changed.\n\nI'm worried.\n\nBecause we canceled less than a week before the wedding, all of our vendors were already paid in full. I'm confident the payments will be honored and our wedding will eventually go off without a hitch \u2014 but we poured all of our money into this big day that still hasn't happened, and now there will be more expenses to come.\n\nOur new date is only a few months away so we're in the process of reprinting and resending invitations, but I'm nervous about making that move. Will this be over by then? Will we get close to that date and realize we have to postpone once again? Right now I feel as if my life is on hold.\n\nOverall I know we're lucky. I'm a teacher and my fianc\u00e9 is a cop, so we both are still working and we both have our health. A $3,000 loss is tough to bear, especially when so many people are out of work, but it could have been so much worse. My friends and family have been so supportive, and I keep telling myself the worst possible scenario has already happened. It can only get better from here.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1007,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/oklahoma-nail-salon-worker-infected-with-coronavirus-after-reopening-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Charles Davis']","title":"Oklahoma nail salon worker contracted the coronavirus shortly after the business reopened","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5ebde9ff5af6cc32697eb195?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"A nail salon in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, said an employee tested positive for COVID-19 \u2014 just days after it reopened.\n\n\"We have received a positive COVID-19 test from a staff member who was in the salon on May 5-7,\" The Nailspot said in a May 13 Facebook post. \"If you were in the salon on these days you could have been potentially exposed.\"\n\nOklahoma allowed nail salons and other \"personal contact\" businesses to reopen on April 24.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe Nailspot opened its doors for the first time in weeks on May 5.

The agency notified authorities this week that it will no longer be able to support 140 of its 180 facilities in the country.\n\nIt's a new, imminent threat to medical care for women in a country ravaged by years of war and disease. The U.N. says tens of thousands of expectant mothers will be at risk of dying during childbirth if funding isn't secured.\n\nUNFPA, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency, provides basic reproductive healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemeni women. The agency says that without its services, 320,000 pregnant women will be cut off from care and 48,000 could die from complications during delivery. The situation is only expected to worsen with the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"By cutting support to UNFPA, you've basically cut the umbilical cord of the reproductive health system in the country,\" Nestor Owomuhangi, representative for UNFPA in Yemen, told CBS News.\n\n\"It's grave,\" he said. \"It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and\u2026 you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors.\"\n\nWorld's worst humanitarian crisis\n\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic, aid groups were already calling the situation in Yemen the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Years of brutal conflict between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi Arabia-backed government have decimated the country's infrastructure and led to widespread famine and disease.\n\n\"And then you have a situation where you have the coronavirus that has devastated the world, and for Yemen, we are looking at a population that has been resilient in a sense, but has gone through all kinds of catastrophes - of cholera and malnutrition - and therefore their immunity levels are low,\" Owomuhangi said.\n\nPeople in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.\n\n\"They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us,\" Owomuhangi said.\n\nWomen's health and COVID-19\n\nUNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.\n\n\"It's already the minimum service,\" Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. \"These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly \u2013 the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story,\" he said.\n\nEven before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year. When a donor conference was cancelled in April because of the pandemic, it left them in dire straits. UNFPA says it now needs $59 million to continue operations in Yemen until the end of 2020, plus another $24 million to deal with the extra burden of COVID-19 in the country.\n\n\"Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?\" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., \"to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis.\"\n\nOnly a few dozen cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen, but on Friday, the international healthcare nonprofit Doctors Without Borders said that, because testing capacity in the country is \"extremely limited, it is impossible to know the full extent of the spread of the virus.\" The charity Save the Children said it has seen a surge in deaths of people with coronavirus symptoms in the southern city of Aden - approximately 50 people a day over the last week.\n\n\"Our hope is in the hope of the people who believe that we can make a difference,\" Owomuhangi said. \"And for that reason we have no choice but to believe that we can be able to provide support, whatever we can, not to let the population down.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1022,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/heroes-act-coronavirus-relief-house-vote-today-2020-05-15\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Grace Segers']","title":"House passes $3 trillion COVID-19 relief bill","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2019\/02\/13\/7729990f-2f95-4e29-a0e6-d3f0048c4ca2\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/1b805fa52114410a52d741424d50346c\/washington-gettyimages-915269972.jpg","body_text":"On Friday evening, the House passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill providing assistance to state and local governments, hazard pay for frontline health care workers, student debt forgiveness and bolstered Medicaid and Medicare. The bill is known as the HEROES Act, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act.\n\nThe measure, over 1,800 pages long, is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Senate, although Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the Senate will pass further COVID-19 relief legislation. But he said he will work with the White House to determine what's needed and how soon.\n\nMcConnell has backed off an earlier statement that states should be allowed to go bankrupt, conceding that there will have to be another relief bill at some point. However, he said his red line is the inclusion of liability-protection provisions for businesses to keep them from being sued if workers or patrons are infected with COVID-19.\n\nThe House bill will now go the Senate, where Republican senators have already indicated the bill is dead on arrival.\n\nEarlier Friday evening, the House also passed a measure to temporarily allow both remote voting by proxy and official remote committee proceedings during the coronavirus pandemic. The nearly party-line vote, 217 to 189, means that a member present at the Capitol would be able to cast a vote on behalf of up to 10 absent colleagues.\n\nThe pandemic has raised concerns about having lawmakers gather to vote, particularly since many members of Congress are older than 60 and therefore more vulnerable to serious illness caused by the virus.\n\nHouse Republicans opposed the rule change, arguing that members of Congress are essential workers and should return to the Capitol.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said when she announced the legislation on Wednesday that the plan was \"necessary to address the corona crisis,\" arguing that the bill's priorities were \"opening our economy safely and soon, honoring our heroes, and then putting much needed money in the pockets of Americans.\"\n\nThe House votes came as the unemployment rate rises to levels unseen since the Great Depression, with millions of Americans out of work or furloughed.\n\nThe bill includes provisions to assist farmers, protect renters and homeowners from evictions and foreclosures, and extend family and medical leave provisions previously approved by Congress. The legislation would also provide relief for essential workers, such as aviation, rail and Amtrak workers, as well as extend work visas for immigrants.\n\nIt faced opposition from Republicans and more moderate Democrats in the House because of its size, although progressives argue the legislation doesn't go far enough. Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, known for her progressive politics, told reporters Friday that she would not support the bill.\n\n\"I, unfortunately, will be voting no on the bill, and really, this was a difficult decision for me,\" Jayapal said, explaining that the bill did not do enough to ensure paycheck guarantees for struggling workers.\n\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent progressive freshman in the House, told reporters that it was a \"tough bill.\"\n\n\"I think we can go further, especially when it comes to healthcare,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, calling the bill a \"mixed bag.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans argued that the bill was far too large. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, said on the House floor Friday that it was a \"dark day for our country.\" Republican Congressman Tom Cole called the legislation \"massive and unwarranted.\"\n\n\"I'm just mystified why my friends felt the need to inject a clearly partisan bill and think this is going to move us down the road in the right direction. It's not,\" Cole said on the House floor.\n\nIn his weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appealed to the 40 freshman Democrats who flipped Republican seats in 2018, urging them to vote against the bill.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously said it was time to hit \"pause\" on negotiating the next round of coronavirus legislation.\n\n\"The president and Senate Republicans are going to be in the same place,\" he said in an interview on Fox News on Thursday. \"We will let you know when we think the time is right to begin to move again. I think there's a high likelihood we'll do another bill, and I've just indicated what we'll need to be a part of any bill that actually gets a presidential signature and is brought up and passed by a Republican majority in the Senate.\"\n\nKimberly Brown and Nancy Cordes contributed to this report.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1031,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/r-kelly-request-to-be-released-from-jail-amid-coronavirus-denied-2020-05-15\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":[],"title":"Judge denies R.

Penney, one of America's most recognizable clothing stores, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Friday. In doing so, the 118-year-old store became the latest major retailer to succumb to a sales slump during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJ.C. Penney was one of many brick-and-mortar stores forced to temporarily close its locations as the pandemic spread across the U.S. The closures put J.C. Penney a step closer to bankruptcy, the company said Friday.\n\nCEO Jill Soltau said in a statement Friday that J.C. Penney's leadership made significant progress toward rebuilding the company, but \"the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.\"\n\nJ.C. Penney officials said its physical and online stores will remain open during the bankruptcy restructuring. The company has already begun reopening some locations, including in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. The Plano-based clothing store filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Southern District of Texas.\n\nAlthough the pandemic further dented J.C. Penney, the store has been declining for years amid the growth in e-commerce, and is weighed down by $4 billion in debt. It has closed numerous stores in recent years to cut costs.\n\nJ.C. Penney has $500 million in cash and has commitments from lenders for another $900 million to help the company get through its structuring, company officials said. J.C. Penney plans to close more stores as part of the bankruptcy, but company officials didn't specify which ones or how many.\n\nSoltau said bankruptcy \"is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come.\"\n\nJ.C. Penney, which has roughly 85,000 employees, has now joined Neiman Marcus and J. Crew among the retailers to go bankrupt since the virus struck. In its most recent quarter J.C. Penney's sales fell nearly 8%, to $3.4 billion, from the year-ago period, while income was $27 million, down from $75 million a year ago. J.C. Penney missed two debt payments in April and May, which many analysts saw as a harbinger of bankruptcy.\n\n\"J.C. Penney actually embraced e-commerce earlier than most other U.S. department store chains, but the company did not capitalize on this head start,\" Bob Hoyler, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International, said in a statement to CBS News. \"J.C. Penney has not been able to survive on its e-commerce sales alone during the pandemic, so the forced store closures represent months of revenue that will simply never be recouped.\"\n\nThe company's bankruptcy comes days after J.C.

Them' In A Pandemic: Researchers Warn Divisions Could Get Dangerous\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya\/AP Paul Sancya\/AP\n\nAs the pandemic moves from public health crisis to partisan flashpoint, the debate over the coronavirus response in the U.S. is becoming increasingly nasty \u2013 and, in some cases, violent.\n\nIt's not just the clusters of gun-toting protesters at state capitols. In sporadic incidents across the country, disputes over emergency measures have turned into shootings, fistfights and beatings. Stories abound of intimidation over masking. And armed right-wing groups have threatened contact tracers and people who they say \"snitch\" on neighbors and businesses violating health orders.\n\nResearchers who study the links between polarization and violence stress that these incidents are still rare and extreme reactions; polls show that the majority of Americans support and are abiding by distancing measures. But there are fears that the pandemic \u2014 especially landing in an election year \u2014 has the potential to inflame divisions to dangerous levels if left unchecked.\n\n\"If we don't intervene as a nation, as citizens, to begin to correct this identity-based polarization, then the erosion of democratic norms will go even further. And that's the threat of potential social unrest,\" said Tim Phillips, head of the Boston-based nonprofit Beyond Conflict, which tracks polarization and supports peace efforts around the world.\n\nResearchers cite leadership as a key factor in the struggle against polarization. But President Trump draws support through identity politics and has signaled repeatedly that he'll play to his base even in a national health emergency. Take, for example, Trump's refusal to wear a mask despite the advice of his own health authorities and recent coronavirus infections among White House staffers.\n\nTrump has said, with little elaboration, that donning a mask would \"send the wrong message.\" Rachel Kleinfeld, who studies polarization and violence at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the president's decision not to wear a mask is calculated.\n\n\"Trump recognizes that by talking about masking in a certain way, he can play on an identity,\" Kleinfeld said. \"And it's an identity of virility versus fear, an identity of urban versus rural, an identity of race, even, given who's being hit by the virus, and he can do all those things by triggering something that was not polarizing before, which is whether or not you wear a mask in public.\"\n\nPolling shows that masking brings the starkest partisan breakdown of any protective measure: 76% of Democrats say they wear a mask when leaving home, compared with 59% of Republicans, according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nPhillips said Beyond Conflict, in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, will soon release findings that show Americans are indeed polarized, just not as badly as they think. He said news coverage and social media have led to both sides imagining deeper divisions than actually exist \u2014 a point to remember, he said, when looking at scenes of pandemic-related violence.\n\n\"When we see the armed militia in Michigan, when we see people sort of defying the police \u2014 not just mayors and governors \u2014 to open up their stores or open up other locations, we tend to think that that's representative of the other side, that they must all think that way,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"And yet there's polling in the last two weeks, last week, in the United States that across the Republican-Democratic divide, the majority of Americans recognize that there's a public health crisis and we have to do something about it.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/5\/15\/21260747\/coronavirus-pandemic-relief-bill-democrats-congress-house-spending-stimulus-covid-19","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":[],"title":"Democrats push new $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through House","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/7WemHDgu8oTpKho5uYhiDzuKbqY=\/0x0:3826x2003\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19981606\/Pelosi_stimulus_vote.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House on Friday, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.\n\nThe 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November\u2019s presidential and congressional elections.\n\nThe enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.\n\n\u201cNot to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it\u2019s only going to cost more,\u201d warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u201cMore in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.\u201d\n\nRepublicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states\u2019 partial business re-openings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.\n\nRepublicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.\n\n\u201cPhase Four is going to happen,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.\u201d\n\nTrump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet on board.\n\nThe daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that\u2019s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.\n\nMany members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.\n\nTo enhance the bill\u2019s political impact, Democrats named their measure \u201cThe Heroes Act\u201d for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. \u201cWhere do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?\u201d\n\nRepublicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry\u2019s access to banks.\n\n\u201cIt may help the cannabis industry, but it won\u2019t help Main Street,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nPelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers\u2019 salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.\n\nFourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party\u2019s most vulnerable lawmakers in November\u2019s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.\n\nAmong them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure \u201cbloated.\u201d Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, \u201cThis bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were already planning to use the day\u2019s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday\u2019s legislation and face competitive reelection races.\n\nClearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren\u2019t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.\n\nSome congressional aides said the Democratic bill\u2019s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an \u201cemployee retention\u201d tax credit for businesses more generous.\n\nRepublicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.\n\n\u201cThis bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is \u201cgoing nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.\u201d\n\nLiberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, \u201cI can\u2019t tell them yes.\u201d\n\nThe lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/pmis-inflammatory-syndrome-kawasaki-disease-children-coronavirus-link\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Audrey Mcnamara']","title":"What parents should know about the mysterious illness appearing in kids, according to doctors","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/05\/11\/618ea26d-eaa3-4576-bfa0-29de8d51e863\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/4bf28234cfa81387fc582a6dde55da0b\/pediatric-multi-system-inflammatory-syndrome-620.jpg","body_text":"At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic it appeared that young people were largely spared from the virus. Now, doctors believe there's growing evidence that a rare, mysterious illness appearing in children may be linked to the virus.\n\nIt's been dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, abbreviated as PMIS or PIMS. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory to doctors about it Thursday afternoon, referring to the condition as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nSymptoms of the syndrome have been compared to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic-shock syndrome. PMIS, however, is being recognized as a \"new entity,\" according to Dr. Luiza Petre, a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine in New York.\n\nKawasaki disease is a rare but serious illness believed to be triggered by the immune system's response to infection, but an official cause is unknown.\n\nChildren with Kawasaki experience a prolonged fever lasting several days, a skin rash and swollen lymph nodes in the neck; affected children can also develop redness in their eyes, lips, mouth, as well as the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most children recover, but if left untreated, Kawasaki can cause cardiac issues and become life-threatening. Toxic shock also causes fever and a decrease in blood flow, but is triggered by a bacterial infection.\n\nKawasaki disease mostly occurs in children under the age of 5, while a study of PMIS cases in Italy found an average age of 7\u00bd.\n\nWhile an understanding of PMIS is still evolving, children with the syndrome also experience a prolonged fever, rashes, change in the color of their skin or their lips, swollen glands and red eyes. What differentiates PMIS from Kawasaki appears to be complaints of abdominal pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and chest pain.\n\n\"What we're seeing is the immune system is actually going into overdrive, impacting the body in a negative way,\" Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric oncologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children, in New Orleans, who has treated several children for the illness, told CBS News. \"Some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries, and you can have basically a heart attack.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, the level of inflammation in the heart tends to be higher with PMIS, as compared to Kawasaki disease.\n\nAll together, the syndrome has shown to be more severe than Kawasaki. \"That's what's concerning,\" Petre told CBSN. \"And a lot of (PMIS) cases do require ICU, almost 80% of them.\"\n\nPMIS has been reported in over 100 children in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. CBS News has tallied about 200 cases under investigation in 19 states and Washington, D.C., and cases have also been reported in at least six other countries.\n\nDoctors in Italy published a study Wednesday documenting numerous cases of PMIS linked to the coronavirus. Eight out of 10 children they studied with PMIS had antibodies to COVID-19, indicating that they had been infected.\n\nThe fact that the syndrome is appearing in places where coronavirus is prevalent suggests that there could be a correlation, O'Leary said. He cautioned, however, that it's still too early to say anything for certain: \"Some of the things I tell you will be true tomorrow, but some of them may not,\" he said.\n\nCBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula said, \"It's important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic, this is rare. We're still learning a lot more about it.\"\n\nNew clues in mysterious illness potentially linked to COVID-19 in children\n\nA majority of the children with PMIS symptoms reported in New York have also tested positive for COVID-19, but others have not. \"That is something we doctors don't have an explanation for,\" Petre said.\n\n\"If we talk about the frequency of Kawasaki disease, even the specialists in this disease say they've never seen more than five cases at once in one hospital,\" she said. \"So that's something definitely suspicious about the timing between COVID and these cases.\"\n\nAccording to O'Leary, PMIS cases seem to appear about a month after a peak of COVID-19 cases in an area. If the syndrome is brought on by a COVID-19 infection, the lag time for PMIS symptoms is a curious feature, he said. \"It's almost more surprising that most of these kids are (COVID-19) positive.\"\n\n\"That's the mystery, it's a lot like a delayed reaction,\" Petre said of the symptoms' onset.\n\nIf a child does present with PMIS symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor. According to Petre, if a child has a fever that doesn't go down and is resistant to medication for more than a day, a doctor should be contacted.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines for parents earlier this week advising them to call their pediatrician if they notice any of the following symptoms:\n\na fever that won't go away\n\nabdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting\n\nrash or changes in skin color\n\ntrouble breathing\n\nyour child seems confused or overly sleepy\n\n\"In this syndrome early intervention is critical as children can decompensate very quickly, and they should seek medical attention immediately,\" Petre said.\n\nAccording to Petre and O'Leary, if a child is admitted for PMIS, their primary treatment will be supportive care. Fluids and medication would likely be administered to maintain blood pressure, as well as anti-inflammatory medication like steroids or immunoglobulin (IVIG).\n\n\"If you're not really aware of this syndrome that's being described, it could easily be missed,\" said Kleinmahon. \"Fortunately children overall are very resilient. And almost all of the cases, if we're able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this, they're usually doing very well.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/crime\/2020\/5\/15\/21260543\/corrupt-ex-alderman-ambrosio-medrano-released-prison-over-coronavirus-concerns","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Jon Seidel']","title":"Corrupt ex-Ald.

And particularly, looking across the typical demographic of black churches in Chicago, it\u2019s a lot of very faithful, but senior elders, many of whom have challenging underlying health conditions,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nLightfoot noted 93% of Chicagoans who have died from the coronavirus have had underlying medical conditions.\n\n\u201cThis is not playing Russian roulette. This is playing with a gun that\u2019s fully loaded and cocked. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.\n\nLightfoot said she\u2019s aware a \u201csmall handful\u201d of churches have \u201cadvertised that they intend to hold services\u201d Sunday in violation of Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s stay-at-home order.\n\nShe\u2019s been in contact with all of them \u2014 by letter and by phone \u2014 to try to \u201cengage them in a conversation rather than being in conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe let them know what our expectation is. We\u2019re hopeful that we will not have to take any kind of enforcement action. But if we have to, we will,\u201d Lightfoot said.\n\nPressed on what form \u201cenforcement action\u201d might take, the mayor would only say there are \u201ca number of tools that we have as a result of this pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hope, as always, is that our better angels will prevail. That we\u2019ll be able to educate people into compliance,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be in conversation than in conflict. That\u2019s the hand that we\u2019ve extended. ... I hope that they will come to us in the same spirit.\u201d\n\nIn her \u201cDear Members of the Chicago Faith Community\u201d letter, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to \u201cstay the course\u201d and continue holding virtual services rather than meeting in-person \u2014 where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.\n\n\u201cI am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor\u2019s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from noncompliance, no matter the source or the intention,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cYes, limiting services and other important religious convenings \u2014 like funerals, baptisms, bat and bar mitzvahs, breaking fasts and weddings \u2014 is hard. But it remains every bit as important now as ever. ... This moment is very much about the cold reality of the facts ... how this virus is transmitted, and how ruthlessly it attacks.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Lightfoot had responded to Sunday services held the day before, in defiance of the order, by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,\u201d she said then.\n\nBut the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor\u2019s order.\n\nHer letter invites religious leaders to join her in a \u201cconversation\u201d about \u201cwhat a gradual reopening will look like for protection of faith workers and congregants.\u201d\n\nThe conversation began Friday during a phone call with religious leaders and will continue with the creation of what Lightfoot called a \u201cworking group across the various faith traditions to really get granular\u201d about ways churches, mosques and temples can reopen safely.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that we\u2019ve got real guidance on everything from cleaning to face coverings,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cCan you sing with a mask?

At times, it seems that he is the last subscriber to the \u201cGreat Man\u201d theory of history.\n\nWell, none of us have control over our own obituaries\n\nThe problem is that history tends to be written by the survivors \u2014 a heel turn late in life, for instance, will obliterate any contemporary admiration. In Los Angeles, this is most clearly borne out by William Mullholland. Mulholland \u2014 an obsessed engineer whose dream was to supply Los Angeles with enough water for generations of growth \u2014 performed an examination on the St. Francis Dam hours before it collapsed, killing hundreds in one of the worst disasters in California\u2019s history. Brilliant and witty as Mullholland was, he is now known primarily for that disaster and his abysmal behavior in the Owens Valley water conflict, which inspired the movie Chinatown.\n\nWell, none of us have control over our own obituaries, assuming we are lucky enough to get an obituary at all. But it is certainly curious to see a man with such an obvious interest in his legacy make moves that may destroy it. This brings us to the reopening of the Tesla Fremont plant in apparent violation of an Alameda County health order prohibiting the factory from operating.\n\nLast week, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that some manufacturing in the state would be allowed to resume on May 8; but if the state and the county disagree, the more restrictive order is the one that matters. And although some counties may go slower than the state in reopening business, no one may go faster, according to Sonia Angell, the head of the state\u2019s department of public health.\n\nThe immediate action began with tweets: Musk railed against the Alameda County order to continue sheltering in place and threatened to leave California. He also filed suit against Alameda County. Tesla began making cars again at its Fremont, California factory last weekend, The Verge\u2019s Sean O\u2019Kane reported. Workers who had been placed on furlough were called back. On Monday, Musk tweeted confirmation of that reporting and said, \u201cIf anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.\u201d Shortly after that, Nevada Gigafactory workers received an email calling them back to work as well, O\u2019Kane reported.\n\nCalifornia should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020\n\nOn Tuesday, US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Musk: \u201cCalifornia should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!\u201d Later that evening, Alameda County announced it had received Tesla\u2019s safety plan for Fremont and that \u201cTesla can begin to augment their minimum business operations this week in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week.\u201d On Wednesday, an internal email sent from Tesla said that the company is ramping up its production this week to get to full capacity, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nFremont is located in one of the six counties that make up the San Francisco Bay Area, which was the first in the country to issue shelter-in-place orders and close non-essential businesses \u2014 a move that Musk resisted at the time, causing a county health official to remark Musk had created a public health risk. But the Bay Area\u2019s quick action \u2014 along with a little bit of luck \u2014 ensured that the cities in it were spared the full horror of the outbreak, at least so far. Though the first community-transmission cases were detected here, only about 350 deaths from COVID-19 had been confirmed as of the beginning of May; University of California San Francisco epidemiologist George Rutherford estimated that the Bay Area\u2019s action had saved more than 1,000 lives.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has been progressive and forward-thinking in how they\u2019ve handled COVID-19, and that shows in their numbers,\u201d John Brownstein, who leads the Computational Epidemiology Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, tells The Verge.\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the country, major outbreaks have occurred at meat packing plants. One report from a Chinese restaurant showed that a single person\u2019s breathing infected 10 people from three families, two of which were sitting at separate tables, over the course of an hour and a half. Another report, of an outbreak in a South Korean call center, showed that one infected employee in the call center resulted in 94 cases \u2014 though how much of that is attributable to touching shared objects and how much was airflow remains unknown. A choir rehearsal with a single sick person resulted in 45 cases. At one Staten Island Amazon warehouse, there have been at least 35 cases; across 125 Amazon warehouse facilities, workers have recorded at least 606 cases. At least one Amazon warehouse worker has died of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nThere are still things we don\u2019t know about how the virus spreads, but we do have some clues from these reports: closed environments where people spend a lot of time in proximity seem to be risks, says Brownstein, who is also a professor at Harvard Medical School. Brownstein thinks there are ways to mitigate risk from these environments, but those decisions will vary by location and should be made by local and state governments.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that offended me about what\u2019s being proposed here is the civil disobedience aspect,\u201d says Mark Cullen, director of the Center for Population Health Sciences at Stanford, in an interview. \u201cAny time you take what turns out to be brilliant planning on the part of our six counties \u2014 and to snub the value of that very publicly, make this \u2018fuck you\u2019 libertarian statement, and say \u2018if you don\u2019t do what I want, I\u2019ll move to another state\u2019 \u2014 highlights what\u2019s wrong with public health thinking and policy. It\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another unknown: what happens if businesses that are reopening must shut down again, says Liliana Tenney, a senior instructor at the Colorado School of Public Health. Until there\u2019s legislation to protect these workers, we should respect local, state, and federal restrictions \u2014 and err on the side of caution, Tenney says. That protects all citizens, but particularly workers who face the choice of either working at places like Tesla or unemployment.\n\n\u201cMost employers are very nervous about this return to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen through our experience is that most employers are very nervous about this return to work and the return to operations,\u201d Tenney tells The Verge. \u201cAnd they are doing everything in their power to enact safety measures but also to pause and take it slowly.\u201d\n\nAll of the experts I spoke to agreed there are ways to make workplaces like Tesla safer. One is to group workers into cohorts, so if one person in the group gets sick, the number of people who are exposed is smaller. Screening people for coronavirus on a daily or weekly basis will also make it less likely a disastrous outbreak will occur, particularly if it\u2019s paired with contact tracing. Personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, may make workers safer, too. Managing the facility \u2014 spacing people out, increasing ventilation, and disinfecting surfaces more frequently \u2014 will also lower risks to the workforce.\n\nA \u201creturn to work\u201d playbook from Tesla incorporates these ideas, which the company says were inspired by measures implemented at the Chinese Gigafactory. Measures include increased cleaning, providing hand sanitizer, enforcing social distancing, temperature checks at the entry of the factory, adjusting work shifts, reducing the number of people allowed on company shuttles, and providing personal protective equipment. One of the assembly lines is, famously, a tent in a parking lot, which may also provide better ventilation than indoor lines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay six feet from people.\u201d\n\nProduction lines are moving more slowly than usual, according to internal Tesla correspondence seen by CNBC. Three Fremont employees told the outlet that their temperatures were taken at the factory entrance, dispensers for hand sanitizer had been placed, and they\u2019d been given surgical masks. Scheduled break times were meant to reduce contact in bathrooms and dining areas.\n\nStill, several employees feel they are being pressured to return to work, NBC News reported. One worker said that her supervisor told her that if she didn\u2019t return to work as directed, she was in danger of being fired. Internal Tesla emails viewed by NBC said that employees who didn\u2019t return to work would no longer receive unemployment insurance, and would have to take unpaid leave. A worker told NBC that staying away from people in the plant was difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay six feet from people,\u201d the anonymous employee told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a production line. There\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d Another worker told The New York Times that the production line hadn\u2019t changed much, making it difficult to avoid other workers.\n\nThat was echoed in comments to Joseph Geha, a reporter for the Bay Area News Group: \u201cThe work that we do requires us to constantly be in close proximity to people,\u201d the worker said. (The negative views are not uniformly held: a worker told Geha that they were fine with the factory reopening.) Another worker told The San Jose Mercury News that tools used on the production line are shared and aren\u2019t being cleaned or sanitized between uses.\n\n\u201cI think Tesla did a pretty good job, and that\u2019s why I had it to the point where on May 18, Tesla would have opened.\u201d\n\nOn one level, the kerfuffle is bewildering. Musk has spent years presenting himself as an enthusiastic acolyte of science. What\u2019s more, in an interview with The New York Times on May 9th, an Alameda county official said that the county and Tesla had been close to an agreement to reopen the plant on May 18.\n\n\u201cWe were working on a lot of policies and procedures to help operate that plant and quite frankly, I think Tesla did a pretty good job, and that\u2019s why I had it to the point where on May 18, Tesla would have opened,\u201d said Scott Haggerty, the county supervisor for the district where the Fremont plant operates, according to The New York Times. \u201cI know Elon knew that. But he wanted it this week.\u201d\n\nThe May 18 restart would have put Tesla squarely in line with other automakers\u2019 efforts to reopen their plants. Mercedes-Benz fired up its Alabama facility on April 27. BMW\u2019s South Carolina plant started up on May 4; GM began production on May 11, as did Honda, Subaru, and Volvo. Toyota planned to restart its US production this week. Fiat Chrysler will resume on May 18, as will Ford. Volkswagen has postponed starting up its plants indefinitely.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, car sales cratered in March. In April, though, they seemed to slightly recover, though sales were still down 50 percent compared with April 2019. So why start the fight with Alameda at all?\n\n\u201cAs the world comes back online, Tesla will be competing against other automakers who are literally throwing out all the stops.\u201d\n\nJust before the coronavirus-related health orders closed plants, Tesla was launching its Model Y SUV. SUVs, along with pickup trucks, were among the few bright spots in the market these last few months, says Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds. Dealers have also been offering remarkable incentives, such as zero percent interest loans for as long as seven years. Different areas in the world are recovering at different speeds, Caldwell points out. So Musk might want his factories up and running for when markets \u2014 in the US or elsewhere \u2014 recover. And Tesla makes cars at just two places: Shanghai and Fremont.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not producing at either factory they have no global production,\u201d Caldwell says. \u201cAnd as the world comes back online, Tesla will be competing against other automakers who are literally throwing out all the stops.\u201d\n\nThe Model Y is particularly important, says Karl Brauer, the executive publisher at Autotrader and Kelly Blue Book. \u201cHe\u2019s got enough demand in the US and globally that he can probably sell most \u2014 if not every \u2014 Model Y about as fast as he can build them.\u201d\n\n\u201cElon rightfully feels that taking a non-conventional approach has served him relatively well.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another factor, and it\u2019s political. Before starting his standoff with Alameda County, Musk was already agitating to open Fremont on a private call with President Donald Trump and some other CEOs. Musk told Trump that he did not view returning to work as a significant risk, and the president agreed, The Washington Post reported. SpaceX, Musk\u2019s commercial space company, is heavily reliant on government contracts; if Musk were trying to curry favor with Trump, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\nThere\u2019s also Musk\u2019s image to consider, says Brauer. \u201cElon rightfully feels that taking a non-conventional approach has served him relatively well for the last 15 years that he\u2019s been at Tesla,\u201d Brauer says. \u201cSo if it\u2019s unconventional to break a government mandate if he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a necessary level of caution, it plays into his image and his customer base, which likes his unconventional approach.\u201d\n\nBut the question may be if Musk loses more than he gains by aligning himself with Trump and others who have persistently tried to convince Americans that stay-home orders aren\u2019t necessary, Brauer says. He might gain new customers \u2014 people who ordinarily might not care about electric vehicles but want to support Musk for pushing back against government overreach. Longtime Tesla customers, though, might feel alienated, particularly those who are more collectively-minded.\n\n\u201cI drive a fucking Tesla.\u201d\n\nCullen, the epidemiologist, is among that group. \u201cI drive a fucking Tesla,\u201d Cullen tells The Verge. \u201cWhen the cheap ones came out, I bought one. I love the car. I don\u2019t love Musk.\u201d\n\nIf Musk reopens Tesla successfully, and without sickening his workers, we should all expect an \u201cI told you so!\u201d tweetstorm. But if Fremont workers get sick and bring COVID-19 with them into the places where they live, seeding outbreaks like we\u2019ve seen with meatpacking plants and other close-quarters facilities, Musk stands to lose a tremendous amount of confidence the public has placed in him. Historically, Musk has been a connoisseur of risk \u2014 but now he\u2019s gambling with his legacy.\n\nIf Alameda County\u2019s COVID-19 case counts spike two or three weeks from now, Musk\u2019s role in seeding an epidemic will likely be the first line in his obituary. Under the Great Man theory of history, the man in question takes all the blame.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1085,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/companies-making-coronavirus-immunity-tests-serology-blood-2020-4","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Blake Dodge']","title":"Companies are racing to bring new coronavirus antibody tests to the US.

Generally, antibodies stick around for weeks, months, or sometimes years after infections \u2014 and they often confer some level of immunity to the disease in question.\n\nIt's not yet understood how long and how well antibodies might protect a person from contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Nevertheless, experts have said large-scale antibody testing is necessary to help safely reopen the country. Employers are thinking about using it to determine which people should go back to work, and when. States, hospitals, academic centers, and laboratories are rolling them out to healthcare workers, children, and every day people with growing frequency.\n\nBut the accuracy of coronavirus antibody tests is being called into question, partly due to earlier, relaxed approval requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration. Companies rushed their kits into the US healthcare system after varying degrees of study; when problems with those tests began to pop up, the FDA released tougher approval criteria on May 4.\n\nThat said, larger healthcare groups are now offering tests to US consumers by the millions while researchers continue to independently study the performance of tests.\n\nQuest Diagnostics is offering tests through Abbott Laboratories, PerkinElmer's Euroimmun business, and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, for instance. Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) is only offering Euroimmun's test, according to a spokesperson for the company, but for way less money than Quest's program.\n\nThe costs of antibody tests currently available to consumers ranges widely, from free (through some medical insurance policies or population surveys) to more than $100. Primary care physicians can order antibody tests for patients. You can also find them through government survey programs. New York City, for example, offers antibody tests to any children with COVID-19 symptoms through NYC Health + Hospitals, which is also using Abbott's kit.\n\nIf you're symptomatic and can't take a diagnostic test to detect the virus itself, such as through a spit or nasal swab sample, medical experts told Business Insider that it's best to wait a while before getting an antibody test. (The body takes some time to make them, so antibody tests become most accurate starting about two weeks after symptoms begin.)\n\nThe following list includes companies that have emergency authorization from the FDA, plus one with a high-performing test that doesn't yet have agency approval. Results are ranked by test sensitivity, or ability to detect true positives, though separate scores pertaining to specificity, or ability to detect true negatives, are also included. The scores are based on internal studies conducted by the companies, as well as external ones where available.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1087,"url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2020\/05\/15\/kristof-americas-true-covid-19-death-toll-already-exceeds-100000\/","publisher":"The Mercury News","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Nicholas D.

We\u2019ve crunched the numbers, state by state, and it appears that somewhere around 100,000 to 110,000 Americans have already died as a result of the pandemic, rather than the 83,000 whose deaths have been attributed to the disease, COVID-19.\n\nThat\u2019s my estimate reached with the help of a Harvard statistician, Rafael Irizarry, based on a comparison of death rates this spring with those in previous years. Some states have been largely unaffected \u2014 death rates in some even appear to have dropped, perhaps because of less driving and fewer car accidents \u2014 but others have seen huge surges in deaths.\n\nOverall, in a bit more than two months, the United States lost more Americans to the coronavirus than died over seven decades in the Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.\n\nHere\u2019s how we reached our estimates; they are not definitive, for they are based on preliminary data, and I invite discussion.\n\nThe starting point is that the cause of death is often uncertain. Most people who die don\u2019t get an autopsy, and many never had a coronavirus test. The precise number who died from COVID-19 is in some sense unknowable.\n\nStill, one standard approach to measure the impact of a pandemic like this is to look at \u201cexcess deaths,\u201d meaning mortality greater than the average for a particular time period.\n\nFor example, for the seven weeks ending April 25 in the United States, about 70,000 more Americans died than is normal for those weeks (death is seasonal and normally declines over the course of spring and summer). That 70,000 figure for excess deaths does not include Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which were excluded because of missing or dubious data.\n\nThe official number of COVID-19 deaths in that period for the rest of the country was 49,100. That suggests an undercount of more than 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths as of April 25.\n\nAdd those 20,000 missed deaths to today\u2019s total of 83,000, and you already get more than 100,000 pandemic-related deaths. But the undercount probably continued after April 25, albeit at a lower rate.\n\nWe don\u2019t have good enough mortality data to assess excess deaths in late April and early May, a period in which more than 30,000 Americans are reported to have died of COVID-19. Testing increased significantly, and over time, doctors seemed more willing to list COVID-19 as the cause of death.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably less underreporting as time goes on,\u201d notes Robert N. Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. In New York City, a study likewise found enormous underreporting in the first half of April, then gradually diminishing by the beginning of May.\n\nIn the period we looked at, the undercount also diminished. Initially, there were more than twice as many excess deaths as reported coronavirus deaths, but by April 25 there were only 40% more. If the undercount thereafter were 10%, that would add a few thousand to the total, possibly bringing it closer to 110,000.\n\nThese numbers are uncertain, but the implication is that somewhere around 25,000 more Americans died as a result of the pandemic than are recorded in the death tallies.\n\nThis kind of analysis can\u2019t determine if they died directly from the virus or indirectly. Some presumably perished from heart attacks or strokes because they feared going to hospitals and delayed calling 911, or because ambulance services were stretched thin. In other words, a modest number presumably died because of the virus without being infected by it.\n\nOne reason to think that a great majority of the excess deaths are directly caused by the virus is that in some states that seem to have meticulous reporting, such as Massachusetts, the number of excess deaths and the number of COVID-19 deaths are not so far apart.\n\nIrizarry, who is also chairman of the department of data science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, notes that our new estimates are built on several layers of uncertainty. It typically takes two months for deaths to be reported in a reasonably complete way, so one critical issue is how to adjust for lags in reporting. The CDC tries to estimate what the death total will eventually be based on incomplete reporting, and our estimates depend on its algorithms.\n\nThe mortality figures show enormous variation by state. Texas and California appear to have suffered more deaths from the 2018 flu epidemic than from the coronavirus so far. And according to the CDC numbers, some states, including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Rhode Island, actually experienced fewer deaths than normal in the seven weeks ending April 25. The reason might be a decline in driving and a drop in accidental deaths.\n\nIrizarry calculates that about 70% of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.\n\nThe idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee Tuesday that he didn\u2019t know if the real death toll was 50% higher than the official figures, but that \u201calmost certainly it\u2019s higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,\u201d said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many COVID-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of \u201crespiratory failure\u201d or \u201cmultisystem organ failure.\u201d\n\nDr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, \u201cWe signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.\u201d\n\nSkarimbas said that she would list COVID-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list \u201crespiratory failure\u201d unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether COVID-19 was listed as the cause of death.\n\nThe undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official COVID-19 death counts.\n\nExcess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a variety of techniques to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath exceeded 1,000, perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now 2,975.\n\nCOVID-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.\n\n\u201cWe have saved thousands and thousands of lives,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cHopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.\u201d In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.\n\nNicholas D.

Before the pandemic, Leta and her boyfriend would get \"a few staples and a few novelty snacks and coffee,\" but inevitably certain items would always expire before she could use them. \"You buy some perishables and end up going out to eat,\" she says. \"You could get bored with the resources you already had and buy others.

That worries Steve Coll, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University and a staff writer at the New Yorker. (He was also among the founding fathers of Future Tense; it launched when he was president of New America, a partner with Slate and Arizona State University in Future Tense.) \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose journalism as a court of last resort,\u201d he said during Thursday\u2019s Future Tense web event, \u201cFree Speech Project: Symptoms May Include Censorship,\u201d which examined the pandemic\u2019s impact on free speech around the world. In a conversation with Andr\u00e9s Martinez, editorial director of Future Tense, Coll discussed what we stand to lose if censorship becomes another casualty of COVID-19.\n\nWhen governments fail, journalism can succeed. Coll said that without the Indianapolis Star\u2019s investigative work, Larry Nassar, the former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics physician accused of sexually abusing hundreds of young women, may have not been brought to justice. Now smaller media organizations are folding, larger ones are laying off staff, tech companies are taking a larger role in moderating speech, and governments are quelling dissent and expanding surveillance in the name of the crisis. Together, those trends threaten free speech when we need it most.\n\nAlthough threats against it are as old as free speech itself, Coll said there has been a global shift toward authoritarianism in the 21st century. He described this as a moment when governments aren\u2019t even trying to pretend to value free speech anymore: \u201cRegimes like Turkey and Egypt are jailing more journalists than ever,\u201d and attacks on the credibility of independent journalism are on the rise.\n\nBuilding on this sentiment, Martinez said that global threats against free speech are a \u201cparallel epidemic.\u201d As the entire world responds to the coronavirus pandemic, regimes are getting away with rationalizations of national security that would have been challenged in the past, said Coll. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s embrace of populism is a strategy that is echoing throughout the world,\u201d he said, citing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s efforts to kill press freedom as an example of the impact of the United States surrendering leadership of global human rights promotion.\n\nSpeech isn\u2019t dying out everywhere, though: \u201c[E]ven as there\u2019s a closing of government protections of speech across the world, there\u2019s a huge structural opening of speech online,\u201d said Coll. The advent of online speech has offered new platforms for expression; Coll pointed out that while dissenters in Egypt may have been taken off the radio, dissidents like Mohamed Ali, now exiled in Spain, can write and share things that would have resulted in his immediate arrest in his home country.\n\nWhile online speech was once heralded as a boon to free speech and democracy, it has also created a pathway for viral misinformation. Martinez said that \u201c10 years ago that structural opening was the cause of great optimism \u2026 but in more recent years we\u2019ve been concerned about how these platforms can be weaponized.\u201d Now, legitimate concern about misinformation is being weaponized during the pandemic. As an example, Martinez pointed to countries like Vietnam using COVID-19 as an excuse for silencing dissent.\n\nMartinez asked Coll, a former managing editor of the Washington Post, whether tech platforms should impose editorial judgment on online speech\u2014whether, for instance, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s role at Facebook may come to resemble the Sulzberger family helming the New York Times.\n\nFacebook is attempting to preempt regulation by engineering its own system of content moderation and even establishing a free speech oversight panel, but Coll said we should be cautious about giving platforms authority to decide what constitutes permissible speech: \u201cIt\u2019s always the case that policies that are adopted to silence outside voices silence a lot of other voices.\u201d\n\nDespite the alarming trends, Coll has hope for the future of journalism. \u201cWhat we think of journalism today at [Columbia\u2019s School of Journalism] is lashed to the scientific method, has a public function, and seeks to justify its protection in the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1101,"url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2020\/05\/15\/opinion-coronavirus-radically-alters-doctor-contact-with-patients\/","publisher":"The Mercury News","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Blake Gregory']","title":"Opinion: Coronavirus radically alters doctor contact with patients","image":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/050620-Dr.-Blake-Gregory.jpg?w=374&h=283","body_text":"For primary care physicians, laying hands on patients builds connection and trust. The physical exam is both a ritual and a privilege of the doctor-patient relationship, forged out of the assumption that it can guide treatment to improve the patient\u2019s health.\n\nBut social distancing of the COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered the way we connect with each other physically \u2013 and the way doctors interact with their patients.\n\nWhen the Bay Area in March implemented a shelter-in-place policy to contain the spread of COVID-19, Alameda County\u2019s Highland Hospital scrambled to comply. Literally overnight, our whole model of providing primary care transformed: We had to find ways to treat patients from a distance. Within a few days, we pivoted from providing exclusively office visits to conducting 90% of appointments by phone.\n\nSuch a rapid transformation would have been previously unimaginable. Despite technology that allows us to phone or video conference from almost anywhere across the globe, healthcare delivery systems have been slow to embrace telemedicine platforms. In December 2018, the American Medical Association reported that only 15% of physicians work in organizations that use telemedicine to care for patients.\n\nFinancial barriers were partly to blame for the poor adoption of telehealth among many safety-net institutions. A 2019 report by the RAND Corporation showed that most safety-net systems lost money on telemedicine because reimbursement was much lower than for office visits.\n\nRelated Articles Letter: I\u2019m not a Trump fan, but I think he deserves credit\n\nLetter: Protesters had no face coverings and weren\u2019t social distancing\n\nPhotos: All Bay Area counties join coronavirus phase 2 reopening, allowing storefront retail pickup\n\nTrump says he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine in case he gets coronavirus\n\nHumboldt County coronavirus protester\u2019s \u2018slaves\u2019 sign goes viral Such barriers, however, have faded into the background in the setting of a global pandemic. COVID-19 has been a catalyst revolutionizing healthcare delivery over a matter of days rather than years.\n\nJust as healthcare organizations have had to adapt to COVID-19, I find patients are equally flexible and resilient. When I call patients for a telephone visit, they are grateful. Many of my patients have mobility problems or take multiple buses to get to clinic; they appreciate the convenience of remaining home while also having their health needs addressed.\n\nDuring this pandemic, patients are safer in their own houses. One of my patients recently commented: \u201cThank you for calling, doctor. I am glad we could talk over the phone so I don\u2019t risk exposing myself.\u201d\n\nThe positive experience reported by our patients is consistent with published data on the subject. Massachusetts General Hospital, which has provided telehealth services since 2012, boasts remarkable patient and provider satisfaction with its program.\n\nTo be sure, certain conditions require a physical exam to truly understand what is going on. And regular face-to-face contact will continue to be the foundation of any therapeutic relationship. Office visits are not obsolete, but it is my hope that COVID-19 will permanently transform the way we provide care, even after the pandemic has passed. The flexibility to choose between an in-person assessment and a telehealth visit is good for patients.\n\nFinancial incentives will be essential to maintaining telehealth services over the long term for public hospital systems such as Highland. On March 18, the California Department of Managed Care issued an unprecedented directive to its health plans to \u201creimburse providers at the same rate, whether a service is provided in-person or through telehealth.\u201d\n\nReimbursing remote visits on a par with office visits will help safety-net organizations stay afloat financially during this crisis. It is unclear, however, whether reimbursement on this scale will continue after COVID-19 has died down. Continuing to robustly reimburse telehealth post-COVID-19 will sustain the tremendous innovation and improvement that has proved to be the bright side of this pandemic.\n\nAnd it will help us stay close to patients, even at a distance.\n\nBlake Gregory is the medical director of the Highland Wellness primary care clinics at Highland Hospital\/Alameda Health System.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1103,"url":"https:\/\/washingtonmonthly.com\/2020\/05\/15\/will-covid-19-get-policymakers-to-start-taking-loneliness-seriously\/","publisher":"Washington Monthly","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['John Gomperts']","title":"Will COVID-19 Get Policymakers To Start Taking Loneliness Seriously?","image":"http:\/\/kwtri4b8r0ep8ho61118ipob.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/iStock-1130052240-scaled.jpg","body_text":"Target shoppers turned more to same-day services to cut down on time in stores as Americans sheltered in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer announced Wednesday that its Drive Up curbside pickup, in-store pickup and Shipt delivery grew by 278% in the three-month quarter, which ended May 2.

Andrew Cuomo said that 66% of new hospitalizations in New York for Covid-19 were people who had been staying home. \"This is a surprise: Overwhelmingly, the people were at home,\" Cuomo said. \"We thought maybe they were taking public transportation, and we've taken special precautions on public transportation, but actually no, because these people were literally at home.\" The \"shocking\" data came from a survey of more than 100 New York hospitals and about 1,300 new patients, Cuomo said. It raises the question: \"Of the people who are staying home, how rigorously are they staying at home?\" Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who focuses on risk assessment of infectious diseases, tells CNBC Make It. It's possible that as we enter the ninth and tenth week of fairly extreme prevention measures, people are feeling fatigued or getting too relaxed, says Joseph Vinetz, professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine and physician scientist in infectious diseases. \"Just because we're tired doesn't mean that the virus cares,\" he says. \"Viruses have no emotions; they just do their thing.\" According to Cuomo, \"much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself.\" So from masks to groceries, here's a reminder checklist of the measures epidemiologists and infectious disease experts say you should still absolutely be following, even if you live in a place that's re-opening:\n\nUse masks carefully\n\nSince early April the Centers for Disease Control has suggested that people wear masks or cloth face coverings outside of the home to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. In addition to having a face mask to use, \"people have to be very careful about how they put them on and how they take some off,\" Morse says. Wash your hands before putting your mask on your face. Fit is key: Your mask should cover your nose and mouth snugly, but comfortably. \"There's a wire that goes over the nose piece that you have to mold to your nose,\" Vinetz says. \"Then you have to tuck [the mask] under your chin.\" \"It's not hard [to wear a mask], but somebody has to kind of show people how to do it right,\" he adds. (This helpful video demonstrates how to wear a mask.) Indeed, wearing a mask can feel somewhat uncomfortable, but both for effective prevention and sanitary reasons, it's important to keep it on during your entire outing, instead of removing it to take breaks or talk to people. When you take your mask off, you should remove it without touching the front of it, and wash your hands afterwards, Morse says. \"If [masks] become contaminated and you touch them \u2014 even if your hands are clean \u2014 when you then touch your face afterwards you can infect yourself,\" he says. Reusable cloth masks should be cleaned regularly, per the CDC, which means after each time you wear it, or whenever it becomes soiled. You can wash masks in a washing machine with hot water, and tumble dry them with high heat.\n\nSteer clear of people on the street\n\nMost of us have heard that we need to be at least six feet from other people when out in public. \"That's not a magic number,\" but it's believed to be the distance necessary to prevent respiratory droplets from reaching you if someone sneezes or coughs, Morse says. Physical distance can be hard to come by. \"There's a limit to how far you can, especially in New York City, keep apart,\" Morse says. Try to avoid looking at people face-to-face when you're outside in crowded places, Morse says. \"It sounds strange,\" but it keeps you out of people's line of breath, he adds. You can also try to stagger how you're walking so that you're side-by-side with others, rather than directly behind someone.\n\nKeep washing your hands diligently\n\nHand hygiene is still incredibly important, because it's easy to accidentally touch your face and infect yourself. \"You always want to make sure your hands are clean,\" Morse says. Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer at all the normal times, he says. For example, wash your hands after going to the bathroom; after touching garbage; and before, during and after food prep. \"Also after you touch something on the outside and you come back inside,\" he says. That includes touching doorknobs, opening packages or pressing elevator buttons. Wearing gloves may give you a false sense of security, Vinetz says. If you do wear gloves, you should assume that your hands are dirty, and avoid touching your face. \"If anybody is wearing gloves, I look at them and say, 'You're contaminated, don't touch anything,'\" he says.\n\nBe strategic about running errands\n\nWhen you're running essential errands or frequenting businesses as they begin to open, you should still be extra careful. For starters, you definitely shouldn't be venturing out if you're sick, according to the CDC. Take fewer trips to the store to reduce the amount of exposure you have to other people, and order your food and medication for delivery if possible (and don't accept deliveries in-person), per the CDC. Opt to pay for your items online or over the phone, and use a contactless payment method if you can. If you do go to the store, stay at least six feet from other people and wear a cloth face covering or mask, the CDC says. Some stores have delineated a \"safe distance\" on the floor in checkout lines, and wipes available for patrons to disinfect shopping carts. But even still, you should not touch your eyes, nose or mouth throughout the duration of your trip. Once you're finished shopping, use hand sanitizer and wash your hands with soap and water when you're home.\n\nHandle packages and groceries gingerly\n\nMany people are relying on deliveries to get their groceries and other supplies with minimal contact. But there's evidence that the Covid-19 virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days. When you get a package or bring home a shopping bag, Morse suggests opening it outside of your home. \"Leave it outside the door, and then with clean hands, I would lift out the things that were inside,\" he says. If the contents look like they need to be cleaned, you can wipe them with a disinfectant, he says, but it's not totally necessary. Put the items on a surface that you can clean easily afterwards, and of course wash your hands, Morse says. \"There's only so much you can do, you know, within reason,\" he says.\n\nFollow elevator etiquette\n\nRiding the elevator with someone is a comparatively short time to be exposed to their germs, but you should still be mindful. \"Minimize the number of people in an elevator,\" Morse says.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1125,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-to-pay-mortgage-during-coronavirus-pandemic","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Laura Grace Tarpley']","title":"3 options for people struggling to pay their mortgage during the global health crisis","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5e7d01b3ba85ee0204798668?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Personal Finance Insider writes about products, strategies, and tips to help you make smart decisions with your money.

Here are three possible paths you can take moving forward.\n\n1. Ask your lender about assistance for home owners impacted by COVID-19\n\nFederal mortgage loan companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are making exceptions for homeowners who have been financially impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nYou can apply for forbearance for up to 12 months without facing penalties, and the companies won't report forbearance to credit unions. Beginning July 1, 2020, people with a Fannie Mae- or Freddie Mac-backed mortgage can choose to repay their deferred amount in one lump sum when they sell, refinance, or pay off their home entirely.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are offering mortgage modification programs to decrease monthly payments, and they are temporarily suspending evictions and foreclosures.\n\nMost private lenders are also providing relief for homeowners who have been impacted by COVID-19. In California, over 200 banks and credit unions have agreed to waive mortgage payments for 90 days without hurting borrowers' credit scores.\n\n\"The first step, if you're looking for relief, is just to call your bank up and get someone on the phone,\" says Andy Taylor, general manager of Credit Karma Home. \"It might be a long queue to get through, but bear with it, because it's important. And ask what your options are.\"\n\nTaylor says institutions will probably ask for proof of economic hardship before agreeing to alter your mortgage payments. You may be able to show pay stubs or a letter from your employer to verify you qualify for assistance.\n\n2. Look into refinancing with a small company\n\nMaybe your lender isn't offering exceptions during the outbreak, or you just want to explore other options. Depending on what type of loan you have and how much of your mortgage is left outstanding, refinancing may be a good option.\n\nWhen you refinance your mortgage, you take out a brand new loan with a new interest rate. If your credit score and financial history are strong, you might be able to score a lower rate than you have now.\n\n\"Probably the best way is to find your local mom-and-pop credit union,\" says Taylor. \"Someone who isn't going to have a nationwide footprint, who isn't going to be as inundated as someone who's advertising globally online.\"\n\nLenders have been slammed with refinancing applications the past few weeks. But some small companies might be less overwhelmed, giving them the ability to act more quickly and give you personalized attention.\n\n\"Or find a local mortgage broker,\" Taylor continues. \"Mortgage brokers can often unlock loan products that you wouldn't be able to find as a typical consumer, because they can shop around for a greater variety of loan products that are out there.\"\n\nAs an added bonus, you'll be helping local credit unions and mortgage brokers that might be hurting financially during the coronavirus pandemic. \"You can support them, get a better rate, solve your cash flow problem, and pay a little less out of pocket every month,\" says Taylor. \"That's a good thing all around.\"\n\n3. Tap into your home equity\n\nHave you gained equity in your home? Maybe your home's value has increased, or you've paid down your mortgage substantially. Look for ways to liquidate that equity to access cash for mortgage payments.\n\nTaylor says homeowners with equity might consider cash-out refinancing.\n\nCash-out refinancing is a little different from regular refinancing. You still get a brand new loan, but now the loan amount is for more than what you owe.\n\nSubtract the amount you owe from the amount you receive as a loan. You get to pocket what's left. You're allowed to spend that money on other financial needs \u2014 like mortgage payments.\n\n\"You could both simultaneously cash out the equity in your home \u2014 take a little bit of money that you've built up \u2014 and also lock in a lower rate,\" says Taylor. \"That solves two problems. One, it can solve a cash flow problem, namely you're paying a lower amount every single month. And two, it means you can use that money for things like paying for the mortgage itself.\"\n\nAnother option opening a home equity line of credit, Taylor says. A HELOC is a second mortgage that works sort of like a credit card; use this line of credit used to pay for things, then pay back the borrowed money plus interest each month.\n\nWhile money from your HELOC doesn't go toward mortgage payments, it can help you stay afloat by covering expenses like utility bills or car payments.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1128,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/15\/21260204\/mcdonalds-dine-in-changes-restaurants-fast-food-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":[],"title":"How McDonald\u2019s dine-in experience will change due to coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/3KFTKONS-yFNyL0Ne7EppI3lV7E=\/0x292:4080x2428\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/18337513\/AP19203511927597.jpg","body_text":"As more businesses slowly reopen during the coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019s clear the customer and employee experience will be vastly different.\n\nFast food giant McDonald\u2019s says it will introduce several new safety standards once dine-in rooms reopen to protect customers and workers from the spread of the virus.\n\nThe restaurant said it will close some seating and tables to encourage social distancing, and require employees to wear masks and gloves.

The bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. As businesses reopen, many are requiring shoppers and employees to wear a face mask. Costco, for instance, will not allow shoppers into the store without wearing a face mask. Many employers are requiring all employees to wear a face mask while at work. In some jurisdictions, all citizens must wear a face mask if they are outside of their own home. \u2043 TN Editor\n\nWith the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception.\n\nThis is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness (asymptomatic) or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection--mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mainly intubation and use of a ventilator (respirator), may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals.\n\nBy wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Russell Blaylock, MD\n\nAs for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, \"None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask\/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.\"1 Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.\n\nIt is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history.\n\nNow that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications.\n\nThere is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask (cloth or paper mask) in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 \u00b5m2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange (breathing) to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2\n\nThey found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and\/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death.\n\nA more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3 Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance.\n\nUnfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind--which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.\n\nWhile most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels.\n\nThe importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7\n\nPeople with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9 Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases.10\n\nThere is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.\n\nIt gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13\n\nIt is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them.\n\nOne should not attack and insult those who have chosen not to wear a mask, as these studies suggest that is the wise choice to make.\n\n[For additional research questioning the value of face masks read: FACE IT: The Evidence Proving the Effectiveness of Community Mask Wearing Doesn't Exist; The WHO Agrees.

Two of the three pillars supporting shutdowns have fallen, so can America's economy really come bouncing back, or was that wishful thinking, too?\n\nWhich part of the spider web is essential, and which is not?\n\nEconomic activity is a web of connections. The Defense Logistics Agency has a Small Business Innovation research grant opportunity out, DLA202-012, \"Learning from the Coronavirus: An Economic Assessment on the Effects of Pandemics on the Supply and Demand for Strategic & Critical Materials in the Defense Industrial Base.\" This topic seeks a model to predict how strategic supplies of raw materials and pharmaceuticals critical for the defense sector will be affected under the new paradigms of COVID-19. Although the defense industrial and medical sectors were deemed \"essential,\" many defense supply chains were negatively impacted by the shutdown. Surprised?\n\nEven though the \"essential\" businesses might have been excused from lockdowns, they were not generally excused from extreme social distancing requirements, impacting their work. They had to spend time and effort adapting to the new requirements, and the new materials they required to operate, such as disinfectants, hand sanitizers and acrylic glass, might have been in short supply. Even once operating, the \"essential\" businesses' suppliers might have been deemed non-essential. The businesses and materials that their employees required to maintain their personal lives might have been non-essential, thus affecting their work. Even businesses in free states might have found themselves relying on \"non-essential\" businesses in slave states, with no alternative suppliers available.\n\nThe \"essential\" businesses depended on the \"non-essential\" businesses, and the fall of one brought the other down. The only non-essential \"businesses\" that continued to pay their employees, regardless of whether they worked or not, and suffered no ills were the federal, state, and local governments. Despite continuing strong, these non-essential \"businesses\" managed to push the other businesses down farther. From an economic standpoint, the wrong thing was shut down. What part of the web is non-essential? The kid with the stick.\n\nThe lesson of economic decline is important for economic recovery. Fully one quarter of our economy is lying beaten and bruised in the mud, and those people are not going to just spring up, brush the dust off, and continue as if nothing happened. Nearly 78% of Americans lived paycheck-to-paycheck, including 10% making more than $100,000 per year. Some had too much in their homes, either in mortgages or Section 8\u2013inflated rents. Many others, like Millennials, are lifestyle-poor. What little excess money they had went into economic consumption. Now laid off for almost two months, they are behind on their rents and utilities. Even if they were hired tomorrow, they have one sixth of a year to make up. No extra consumption until 2021; it's beans and rice to the end of the year.\n\nWhat does that drop in consumption mean? Likely a short bounce followed by a drop, like an overloaded aircraft trying to take off. Businesses might take their loans and re-open and re-staff quickly, only to find in the next few months that 20% of their business is missing. That means layoffs come August\u2013October. Even if the re-opening were to be staged, it would have the effect of prolonging the agony and likely lead to a worse drop. For example, rather than a few homeowners putting off improvement projects, a large number of unpaid landlords would start putting off projects, or banks might see loan defaults and then be unable to make merchant loans to entice people to finance projects. Quickly reopening, contractors might lose out on 20% of one sixth of a year's work, but prolonging the shutdowns mean contractors lose out on 20% of one third of a year's work or more.\n\nA quick recovery seems unlikely, and whoever was whispering economic nonsense into the ear of President Trump seemed to have as cavalier an understanding of economics as the health and safety experts had of viral pandemics. Were they the same people?\n\nWho are these health and safety advocates? At the end of April, the faculty, staff, and graduate students of the Harvard School of Public Health began a media blitz to counter President Trump's desire to open our economy. A review of their articles reveals that they are pushing such important epidemic-ending health concepts as single-payer health care, seizure of pharmaceutical companies, mass tracking of all people and their associations, travel papers, forced testing and vaccination, and other socialist nonesuch.\n\nIf you ever questioned who the health and safety experts were, you should have no doubts now. CNN will host a panel of coronavirus experts led by Greta Thunberg. That's right: the 17-year-old student from Stockholm, Sweden. This will be a panel of socialists advocating socialism under the guise of science, health, and safety, consisting of former acting CDC director Richard Besser, former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and TV doctor Sanjay Gupta, led by the most credentialed among them, activist Greta Thunberg. So much for the health and safety experts!\n\nIf you want to know who ruined our economic web, look no farther than the kids with the sticks: the socialists masquerading as scientists. The third pillar of the shutdown has fallen; a quick bounce back is highly unlikely; and even if one does occur, it will probably be an overexertion followed by a several months\u2013 to year-long depression. Whoever was advising President Trump on the economics of shutdown was apparently as knowledgeable of economics as the health and safety experts were of pandemics. Perhaps they were in cahoots to spread socialism?\n\nly unlikely, and even if one does occur, it will probably be an overexertion followed by a several months to year-long depression.

He has accused the country of not reporting accurate numbers and of censoring research regarding the coronavirus.\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline,\" Pompeo told Christian radio program Focus on the Family, earlier this week, Newsweek reported.\n\nThe news comes as tensions between the US and China appear to be escalating. While Trump initially praised President Xi Jinping's response to the outbreak in January, the president and his administration have since blamed it for deliberately starting the virus.\n\nTrump added to White House speculation in April when he said that he had evidence showing that the coronavirus originated from a lab in Wuhan, China, but that he would not reveal what it is.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump suggested that China's handling of the novel coronavirus is proof that Beijing \"will do anything they can\" to ensure he isn't reelected in November.\n\nAt the time of writing, the US has seen more than 1.4 million confirmed cases and 88,507 deaths, according to Worldometer.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1152,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/who-urgent-need-for-data-on-coronavirus-related-illness-children-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":[],"title":"WHO urges medical workers to report cases of the mysterious inflammation disease that's affecting children and appears linked to coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5ec030eb191824613450a874?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"The World Health Organization is calling on medical workers to report cases of a newly-identified inflammation condition affecting children and adolescents that appears to be linked to the coronavirus.\n\nThe illness, called \"multi-system inflammatory syndrome,\" is similar to toxic shock syndrome, requires intensive care and is sometimes fatal.\n\nSymptoms include a rash, heart problems, problems with blood coagulation, or acute vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has released a medical brief warning doctors about a newly-recognized condition linked to the coronavirus that affects children and adolescents.\n\nKnown as \"multisystem inflammatory syndrome,\" the illness has reportedly caused organ failure and shock in children and adolescents and testing suggests it's related to COVID-19.\n\nPreliminary case reports have defined the illness in those aged 0-19 who may have been exposed to coronavirus.

But instead of leaving so many super fans dance-crying to the 1974 winner Waterloo (ABBA), the song contest has instead decided to air a live two-hour special, Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, Saturday on public broadcasting channels in more than 40 countries. (The U.S. is not one of them, so anyone living in that country will have to watch on Eurovision's YouTube channel, where the show will be live-streamed.)\n\nThe show is hosted in the Netherlands, where the contest was supposed to be held this year at the Ahoy concert hall. (The venue has been converted into an emergency hospital for coronavirus patients). All 41 contestants will perform remotely, though this year fans won't be able to phone in their votes for the winner.\n\nEurovision Song Contest YouTube\n\nThe pre-pandemic 2020 favorites included the nerd-disco gem Think About Things by Iceland's Dadi og Gagnamagnid; the bodice-ripper Cleopatra by Azerbaijan's Efendi; and the auto-tuned hallucination jig that is Uno by Russia's Little Big.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the show, several Eurovision performers past and present participated in sweet, low-key home concerts. Fans who missed the signature pyrotechnic drama also turned to Eurovision.TV to look up the vampire-opera \"It's My Life\" by Romania's super-soprano Cesar (2013) or the Hellenic solid-gold dancing in My Number One by Greece's Helena Paparizou, the 2005 winner.\n\nThe Eurovision song contest began in 1956 to bring together a continent shattered by World War II. Seven countries competed that first year, and the winner, Refrain by Switzerland's Lys Assia, is about lost love and innocence. The contest grew to include more countries, including those not in Europe, like Israel.\n\nIn the early years, performers were often backed by live orchestras. They sang in their native language: Vivo Cantando (1969), Hallelujah (1979), Ein bisschen Frieden (1982). As newlyweds in Athens in the 1970s, my parents lived next-door to the 1976 contestant from Greece, folk singer Mariza Koch, who sang this beautiful song in Greek. When I moved to Greece more than a decade ago, I befriended the 1995 contestant from Cyprus, who sang this Eurovision cult classic, also in Greek.\n\nThese days, it's mainly the French and Italians crooning in their native tongues, with these award-winning exceptions.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has also expanded far beyond Europe and now includes Australia, though it did lose Hungary this year.\n\nHungary's national public broadcasting association said it wanted to focus its resources on \"Hungarian pop singers\" though one report said pro government media called the contest a \"homosexual flotilla.\" Hungary has never won the contest but came in fourth in 1994 with this ballad sung by Friderika Bayer.\n\nMany fans observing social distancing cannot hold Eurovision parties at home this year. Some made up for it with online watch parties, which involved tuning in remotely to watch reruns of previous contests. At Saturday night's Eurovision alternative, a featured performance will be the unity anthem Love Shine a Light by Katrina and the Waves, the 1997 winner. The super fans might sing along and also hope that ABBA will too.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1156,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/economic-indicators-show-continued-impact-coronavirus-recession-economy-downturn-lows-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Carmen Reinicke']","title":"These 7 economic signals flashed red this week, showing the continued damage being inflicted by coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5eb35590fc593d2f504f9a64?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"While many states across the US have begun to slowly reopen, economic data continues to show devastation from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEconomists agree that the US is already in a recession.

But some showed glimmers of hope that a recovery may be coming as some states begin to reopen.\n\nHere are seven economic signals that flashed warnings this week.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIn just two short months, the US economy has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and sweeping shut downs to contain the spread of the disease.\n\nLast week's April jobs report showed that the US economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate spiked to 14.7%, the highest since the depths of the Great Depression. Since the eye-watering report, more have been released showing further damage to the US economy.\n\nEconomists and industry watchers agree that the US has been thrown into a recession from the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns. Now, all eyes are watching US economic data to gauge the extent of the damage and weigh what shape a recovery might take.\n\nInitially, some argued that a swift, V-shaped recovery was possible. But as coronavirus-induced layoffs persist, and many consumers are still stuck at home, it now appears that any rebound will be more muted.\n\nThere have also been a few glimmers of hope as many states across the country slowly reopen. For example, even though April's jobs report showed devastating losses, 18.1 million workers were classified as temporarily unemployed, suggesting that they may be able to quickly re-enter the workforce when lockdowns are lifted.\n\nRead more: 'We have a depression on our hands': The CIO of a bearish $150 million fund says the market will grind to new lows after the current bounce is over \u2014 and warns 'a lot more pain' is still to come\n\nIn addition, some reports this week \u2014 while dismal \u2014 may represent a low point before a rebound.

John Lennon\u2019s 1980 death stunned a live television audience on ABC\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d; Osama Bin Laden\u2019s 2011 death earned an announcement during an MLB game on ESPN. The emergence of COVID-19 was not nearly as sudden or surprising in any given moment.\n\nBut if the pandemic did have a specific arrival point, it was the night of March 11.\n\nIn a span of roughly two hours, the NBA went from postponing a game due to a player \u2014 Jazz center Rudy Gobert \u2014 testing positive for the virus to indefinitely suspending the season.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced an unprecedented European travel ban. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson became the first American celebrities to test positive. The ill-fated 2020 NCAA Tournament announced it would play without fans.\n\nAnd during those same two hours, the Hawks and Sharks played a regular-season NHL game like nothing was happening at all.\n\nAs far as the participants in the game knew, nothing was happening.\n\nBut the 21,275 fans who packed the United Center that night knew. What began as another typical game day became a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The fans learned the scope of a crisis that ultimately would ban crowds and sports while in a crowd watching sports.\n\n\u201cIn the morning, it was not a big deal,\u201d said Andrew Cameron, a student at Joliet Junior College, who was in attendance. \u201cThe next day, it was the biggest deal on the planet.\u201d\n\nThis month, the Sun-Times interviewed 18 of the fans lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to be at the game that night.\n\nThey sat in the 100 and 300 levels and in suites and boxes. Some are season-ticket holders. Others were attending their first Hawks game of the season, or ever. Many were Chicagoans, but others traveled from Edmonton or northern Wisconsin to attend the game.\n\nTogether, they experienced perhaps the strangest Hawks game in history.\n\nDaytime\n\nSusan Leibforth received the text from her sons, both Hawks season-ticket holders, a few days in advance: Would she and her husband, Bill, want their tickets for the Sharks game?\n\nFor Bill, in his mid-70s, the answer was no. He already had heard of the health risks of the virus and decided going to a large public gathering wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\nSo Leibforth invited her two granddaughters and one of their friends instead.\n\n\u201cI decided I was just going to be very careful,\u201d she said. \u201cI talked to the girls before we went and said, \u2018Try not to touch the rails,\u2019 and all the things that were new to us then. And I gave them each a little hand sanitizer.\u201d\n\nPatrick Dennis and his girlfriend, Sarah, then Illinois State seniors, also were sharing hand sanitizer and developing a healthy game plan while driving up Interstate 55.\n\nMonths before, Dennis had decided between the Hawks\u2019 March 11 game against the Sharks and the March 13 game against the Senators for a late birthday present, given that both games aligned with his spring break.\n\nHe eventually picked the Sharks matchup, a Wednesday night, because of his wariness of Friday traffic in Chicago. It was to be his third NHL game.\n\n\u201cThe thought crossed my mind as I was driving up,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cI made my girlfriend hand-sanitize everything, don\u2019t touch your face when we\u2019re in the United Center, don\u2019t get too close to other people if we can \u2014 which is kind of a fool\u2019s errand when you\u2019re at a professional sports event.\u201d\n\nAs Leibforth and Dennis drove in, Bob Bednarz \u2014 a season-ticket holder in Section 331 \u2014 sat at dinner with two friends, one a nurse.\n\n\u201cI was asking them, as people in the medical field, \u2018What is your opinion [about COVID-19]?\u2019 \u201d Bednarz said. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018It\u2019s bad, but as long as you keep good hygiene, you wash your hands and you don\u2019t do anything crazy, it shouldn\u2019t affect your day-to-day life.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter that dinner conversation, Bednarz went to the United Center reassured, expecting little to come from the coronavirus.\n\nTracy McGrath, exuberant about receiving last-minute tickets from her boss, felt the same as she waited in security with her boyfriend.\n\n\u201cHe did [feel hesitation] and kept bringing it up, and I kept saying, \u2018You\u2019re crazy, we\u2019re fine. Just stop. Nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s fine,\u2019 \u201d McGrath said. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t really grasp it.\u201d\n\nWhile waiting, she received an email: Her office was closing. She wasn\u2019t to come in Thursday, denying her a chance to thank her boss in person. It was stunning news, but it was just the beginning of a very busy night for her phone.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the arena, Section 333 season-ticket holder Erin Berry ran into her Hawks sales representative and wasn\u2019t quite sure how to behave.\n\n\u201cWe joked, \u2018Do we shake hands? Do we not shake hands? Is that still allowed?\u2019 \u201d Berry said, laughing. \u201cI can remember us making a joke about that, and I was like, \u2018I literally just washed my hands, it\u2019s fine.\u2019 We shook hands, and I was like, \u2018That was still kind of weird.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPuck drop\n\nThe United Center was officially sold out again, marking the building\u2019s 531st consecutive sellout.\n\nBut it was a late-arriving crowd, partially because of the early start \u2014 7 instead of 7:30 p.m. because it was NBC Sports Network\u2019s Wednesday night national game \u2014 and partially because of the coronavirus.\n\nCary Jacobs, another longtime season-ticket holder, noticed the difference in his section.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there were a lot of people that did not go to that game,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThe two aisle seats were empty, and at least four of the seats on the other side of me were empty. And then there\u2019s another group in the row in front of me where there\u2019s five or six season-ticket holders ... and only one of them was there.\u201d\n\nThat had a big impact on the supply-demand curve in the resale market, which already had been ugly for 2019-20 Hawks tickets because of the team\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cJust for kicks, I decided to go online to look at what the ticket prices were at that time, and you could get a ticket basically where we were sitting for $4,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cWe had paid $60 for them, and my girlfriend was not terribly happy to hear that.\u201d\n\nYet the arena eventually filled up, with only slightly more empty seats than usual scattered around during the first period, which ended with a 1-0 Sharks lead.\n\nThen at 8:04, as the second period began, the first domino \u2014 in what would become a transformative night for the nation \u2014 fell.\n\n\u201cI happened to be checking out my phone on Reddit, and just from looking around there, the first thing I saw happened to be the [Europe] travel ban,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cI turned to my girlfriend, and I was like, \u2018Holy crap, this is really getting serious.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the plush BMO Harris Club, where Silvia Hernandez was attending her first hockey game with a business group, there was significantly more alarm.\n\n\u201cAt that time, we had coworkers \u2014 one in Malta, one in the U.K.,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Oh, no. They have to get on the first flight back.\u2019 We were just panicking during the game to figure out what they were going to do.\u201d\n\nAt 8:06, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson released a statement about their positive diagnosis. That revelation brought far less direct impact to Hawks fans than the travel ban but arguably even more sentimentality.\n\n\u201cOnce Tom Hanks had it, I was like, \u2018Oh, anybody can get it,\u2019 \u201d Hernandez said.\n\nDoomsday\n\nEight hundred miles southwest, the Thunder-Jazz NBA game had been called off relatively early. It became official at 7:40. The sports world already was paying close attention to the developing situation there.\n\nSeveral Hawks fans, including Section 306 season-ticket holder Matt Lavieri, mentioned they were among those watching for news out of Oklahoma City.\n\nWhen the bombshells dropped, they dropped fast and hard.\n\nAt 8:27, Gobert tested positive. At 8:30, Patrick Kane gave the Hawks a 2-1 lead. At 8:31, the NBA halted its season. At 8:34, Saad scored.\n\n\u201cI clicked on [an Adrian Wojnarowski tweet], and I thought it was just going to be a trade or something,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cAnd the tweet says, \u2018NBA season suspended.\u2019 And I was just like, \u2018Oh, my god.\u2019\n\n\u201cA few seconds after that, Saad scores, and we just sit down and mull over it and think, \u2018Is that real? The NBA season is suspended because of coronavirus?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAcross the upper bowl, McGrath\u2019s cellphone erupted with 10 times as much buzzing as when her work closed.\n\n\u201cMy phone started blowing up during the game, from Twitter to Facebook to my friends texting me going, \u2018Are you OK? What\u2019s happening? Are you leaving the game?\u2019 \u201d McGrath said.\n\n\u201cYou go into it not thinking about anything but the game. But then when my phone starts blowing up and everybody around you is looking at you like you\u2019re crazy, then it starts to hit you that there\u2019s all this happening, and it\u2019s bigger than sports, and it\u2019s bigger than what\u2019s happening right there in that moment.\u201d\n\nThe news reverberated through the arena even faster than any contagious disease possibly could.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a ripple,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cYou overheard somebody talking about it and thought, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s actually true.\u2019 And you check your phone, and it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, crap, it\u2019s actually true.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe arena was like up, down, up, down,\u201d said Gary Winthrope, who got free tickets in Section 109 from a hesitant friend. \u201cEverybody was looking at their phone, then looking at the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit surreal where you\u2019re kind of in two places at once,\u201d Bednarz said. \u201cYou\u2019re in this environment where everything seems great and you\u2019re celebrating, but at the same time, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, crap, what\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the time, no one in the arena knew if the game would be finished or if the slate of West Coast NHL games scheduled later that night would be played.\n\nOn the TV broadcast, NBCSN commentators Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk made no mention of the elephant in the room until the second period ended, when they teased a \u201cmajor NBA announcement\u201d to be discussed during intermission. Minutes later, Darren Dreger reported that the NHL was crafting a statement.\n\nFinally, at 9:12, the league announced it would defer its decision \u2014 which turned out to mirror the NBA\u2019s \u2014 to the next day. The Hawks game, already in the third period by then, would finish normally.\n\nThat didn\u2019t mean the atmosphere went back to normal, though.\n\nAftermath\n\nDominik Kubalik added a cherry onto the Hawks\u2019 dominant 6-2 win with a rocketing slap shot in the final minutes, making him the only rookie to reach the 30-goal mark so far this season.\n\nBut many fans already had left by then, either because of the blowout or the pandemic. And those who remained didn\u2019t want to touch each other, making the goal more awkward than celebratory.\n\n\u201cBlackhawks fans, we\u2019re a family. Everybody talks and high-fives after a goal,\u201d Winthrope said. \u201cAnd after Kubalik\u2019s goal, everyone stood up, but no one was high-fiving. It wasn\u2019t like what it usually is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was maybe [half] of the people, but a quarter of the reaction,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cIt was less of a get-up-and-scream and more of a \u2018Yay, maybe this will end soon.\u2019 Because I really do think people were scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a win, but it almost didn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d Lavieri said. \u201cIt almost felt like we lost.\u201d\n\nAt the final horn, many of those who remained took pictures of the emptying arena or the \u201cBlackhawks Win!\u201d message on the scoreboard, seemingly aware they wouldn\u2019t see either sight again for quite a while.\n\nIndeed, most of the fans interviewed said they felt certain at that point that the NHL soon would pause its own season, or at least switch to holding all games without fans.\n\n\u201cAll the conversations I could hear \u2014 and the conversation I was having with the person in front of me \u2014 were all like, \u2018OK, this is probably it for the year,\u2019 \u201d Jacobs said. \u201cWhen the game ended, everybody was like, \u2018See you next season.\u2019 Once that [NBA] story came out, everybody got the feeling that we wouldn\u2019t be back.\u201d\n\nFor those already in the concourses, it was a mad dash to the safety and seclusion of their cars. There was little milling around, socializing or even self-relieving.\n\n\u201cI saw almost nobody in the bathroom after the game because I get the feeling people didn\u2019t want to go somewhere like a public restroom that was so possibly highly contaminated,\u201d Cameron said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a postgame tradition for me, no matter who I go with, to walk to the atrium and browse the store and look at the jerseys,\u201d said Justin Ligeski, who attended the game with Cameron. \u201cThat was the first time the switch flipped in my head: \u2018I can\u2019t do that. I need to go home.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBobby Ziegler had it even worse. He\u2019d bought with friends a monthly plan that gave them standing-room tickets to all 11 scheduled Hawks home games in March. But he realized that night they wouldn\u2019t be seeing the final seven.\n\nPlus, he\u2019d ridden the El to the game \u2014 a decision he greatly regretted in retrospect.\n\n\u201cI took the Green Line down, and going home, I was very cognizant not to touch anything,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cI remember my son saying that, in New York, they were already starting to shut the subway down. I was worried if I was going to have to walk home. It was that crazy.\u201d\n\nIn the locker room, the Hawks were just starting to find out all that they\u2019d missed.\n\nThe NHL had implemented a closed-room policy two days before in response to the coronavirus\u2019 spread, so a shell-shocked Patrick Kane, Duncan Keith and coach Jeremy Colliton were instead escorted one by one to talk to the media.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything until just now, seeing it on the TV,\u201d Keith said. \u201cIt makes you wonder what\u2019s going to happen, and it really could be something where we\u2019re doing the same thing [as the NBA].\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess things are getting pretty real around here,\u201d Kane added with a nervous chuckle.\n\nLooking back\n\nMonday marked two months since the March 11 Sharks-Hawks game and the night that flipped 2020 on its head.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been any hockey since, and the AHL \u2014 fittingly, though coincidentally \u2014 commemorated the anniversary by canceling the rest of its season.\n\nThe NHL reportedly continues to evaluate dozens of potential resumption scenarios, but none would begin anytime soon and none would involve fans in the building. The United Center, after all, is filled with thousands of pounds of food and couldn\u2019t host a hockey game if it tried.\n\nMany Chicagoans even might be struggling to remember what pre-coronavirus life was like \u2014 or how nice it was to have numerous live sporting events to consider attending or watching every night.\n\nBut the 21,275 who chose to take in the last game they possibly could have aren\u2019t having any trouble remembering that experience now. They might not forget it for the rest of their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, that could\u2019ve been super risky,\u2019 \u201d Bednarz said. \u201cWho knows how many people \u2014 at the game even \u2014 had [coronavirus] or caught it. But what are you going to do about that? It\u2019s crazy to think about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe historical impact that it\u2019ll have for me are just the feelings I had, sitting in that seat, throughout the whole third period,\u201d Ligeski said. \u201c \u2018What am I going to do after this game? What is life going to be like?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a \u2018Where were you?\u2019 moment,\u201d Winthrope said. \u201cLike a \u2018Where were you when O.J. was [acquitted]?\u2019 kind of thing. And now, \u2018Where were you when coronavirus hit big?\u2019 I was at a sold-out United Center watching the Blackhawks play. And that\u2019s just so weird to me.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1185,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/5\/16\/21260998\/everyone-has-a-story-how-will-world-remember-pandemic","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":[],"title":"\u2018Everyone has a story\u2019: How will world remember pandemic?","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/lZqsnHzlvnRnXwLU3UQ_5tSU9uo=\/0x0:4653x2436\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19981928\/merlin_91221837.jpg","body_text":"Artist Obi Uwakwe was driving through Chicago\u2019s empty streets, camera on his lap to document life during COVID-19, when he saw something that made him stop: a casket being carried out of a church while a few mourners stood by, their faces covered.\n\nThe 43-year-old raised his camera and took a photograph. Later, it would become one of the images Uwakwe used to create paintings inspired by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cTo see maybe six people there, everyone wearing a mask,\u201d he said, \u201cit brought everything together.\u201d\n\nAround the world, people like Uwakwe are creating photographs, paintings, emails, journals and social media posts that will shape how the world remembers the coronavirus pandemic for years and centuries to come. Museums and historical societies already are collecting materials, often with help from people accustomed to capturing and sharing even the most mundane moments around them.\n\nThe result, historians say, will be a collective memory more personal than perhaps any other moment in history.\n\n\u201cEveryone is touched by this. Everyone has a story,\u201d said Erika Holst, curator of history at the Illinois State Museum, one of hundreds across the U.S. gathering pieces of a generational treasure trove. Collecting the items in real time allows historians to nudge people for the stories behind them \u2014 a luxury rarely available, Holst said.\n\n\u201cUsually as historians, we get a lot of numbers \u2014 the number of people who died, the number who got sick, the economic effect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always capture what it felt like.\u201d\n\nThe enormity of the event is forcing historians to balance capturing ephemeral moments and those that will transcend time.\n\nAt the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History, a task force is looking into how to gather and preserve objects, images and documents that could become part of permanent collections. But the pandemic itself is challenging the group\u2019s ability to collect because the museum is closed, so curators are asking potential donors to hold onto items.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to take the long view on this, so (we are) focusing now most on objects that are ephemeral, things that might disappear, that might get thrown away or just used up,\u201d said Benjamin Filene, the museum\u2019s associate director of curatorial affairs.\n\nUnlike during other national crises, people have a camera in their pocket at all times, documenting whatever they deem relevant and sharing it on social media, from the cloth mask they sew and the sourdough bread they baked to the cheer for front-line workers and the Zoom meeting of school students.\n\nBut not every quilt made or puzzle finished can tell the story of what happened in the U.S. in the spring of 2020.\n\n\u201cThere is sort of this overwhelming mass of information, but that information is not necessarily being captured in a way that\u2019s going to be preserved,\u201d Filene said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also the possibility that it is so fragmentary that how much will it translate to somebody else five years from now or 25 or 50 years from now? We don\u2019t just need a thing; we want the story that goes with the thing.\u201d\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture has been working with doctors, nurses and other health workers who have offered to donate personal protective equipment. Senior curator for history William Pretzer said cultural organizations nowadays do \u201crapid-response collecting\u201d and no longer wait until materials are considered memorabilia.\n\n\u201cYou collected stuff because you had historical perspective on that event. You collected the Civil War 20 years after the Civil War. You collected World War II experience in the 1950s,\u201d Pretzer said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do it immediately. Beginning in some ways with 9\/11, however, it became clear that rapid-response collecting, collecting on the spot meant that you got the original evidence.\u201d\n\nPretzer said the museum wants to \u201cgo behind the statistics\u201d showing the virus has disproportionately affected people of color. and explain the reasons for the disparity and what can be done about it in the future.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it\u2019s not a race or color or ethnicity that determines this disproportionate impact. It\u2019s the underlying conditions,\u201d Pretzer said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the economic role? What kinds of jobs are available in that community? What kind of access to health care do people have? What type of access to healthy foods have they had? What access to transportation? What is education like in those communities?\u201d\n\nTechnology is helping historians collect material and tell stories as well. The Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum and publishing house, is using technology known as a \u201cspider\u201d to crawl the web and collect information about how the pandemic is affecting the hard-hit city. Among its finds: the city\u2019s cellphone alert system\u2019s webpage.\n\nThe Maryland Historical Society is sharing posts on its blog and on social media using its own hashtags, #LettersFromtheHomeFrontMD and #CollectingInQuarantineMD. An April 16 entry includes a letter from a woman identified as Lauren from Darlington, Maryland, explaining her fears of contracting COVID-19 while at work. She said she works for the U.S. Postal Service, while her husband is an electrical foreman.\n\n\u201cI have two young children at home and I can not afford to stay home and only receive two-thirds of my pay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are both exposed to the world ... My mother can not get this disease, it may kill her.\u201d\n\nHeather Voelz of Taylorville, Illinois, submitted a photo to the Illinois State Museum of her kids on Easter. But she said most of what she\u2019s recording are things that \u201cwouldn\u2019t mean much to anyone but us.\u201d Voelz and two of her children, ages 3 and 5, are keeping a kids\u2019 journal she found online, and Voelz plans to put the pages in their baby books.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t fully grasp what is happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they will someday.\u201d\n\nZofia Oles, 18, of suburban Chicago started taking photos for her school photography class but kept at it to remember her senior year. Some photos show Oles dancing alone in her room, she and her brother going to the store and neighbors gathering \u2014 at a distance \u2014 in a parking lot.\n\n\u201cI want to have a memory of how it looked so when I am able to be with my friends again, I can appreciate how it was,\u201d she said.\n\nUwakwe said recent weeks remind him of the days after 9\/11, when streets were quiet and there was a collective sense of grieving, helping and appreciation for people on the front lines.\n\nUwakwe didn\u2019t walk around with a camera back then. In the years since, he\u2019s thought about those missed images. It\u2019s what ultimately moved him to get in his car and capture what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cThe more I sat, I thought: \u2018I don\u2019t want to regret not doing it again.\u2019\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1188,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/columnist\/2020\/05\/16\/coronavirus-upgrades-these-sub-100-gadgets-can-improve-work-play\/5200822002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Marc Saltzman']","title":"Tight on cash, but want cool tech?

She hadn\u2019t received the results by the time she arrived for her first day. Her temperature was taken on the way in, but she only gave verbal confirmation that she was not infected.\n\nThe worker, who asked not to be identified because employees at the plant were told to refrain from speaking to the media, was given two moveable plastic sheets on poles to provide a barrier between her and the workers next to her, and new protective equipment, including a face shield and a mask, which made the already grueling work even harder.\n\n\u201cThe face shield is s***,\u201d she told Yahoo News. \u201cIt fogs up and drips down my face.\u201d\n\nThe Smithfield Foods pork processing plant, Sioux Falls, S.D. (Kerem Yucel\/AFP via Getty Images) More\n\nThe Smithfield plant, one of 14 meat-processing facilities to reopen after outbreaks spread among the workforces, is under intense oversight from the CDC.\n\nAs COVID-19 ravages meatpacking plants throughout the country, beef and pork options are dwindling in grocery stores. Consumers are beginning to realize just how much of their meat consumption depends on a flawlessly executed assembly line of some 2,000 workers and a supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. Now, new internal reports from the government warn that some parts of the country may see meat shortages by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cAnalysts suggest that meat supply chain disruptions could see 20 percent higher prices than last year and potential spot shortages of meat in certain markets by the end of May,\u201d says an internal government senior leadership briefing slide dated May 12, and reviewed by Yahoo News.\n\nThe briefing, marked for official use only, was produced by the Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA separate DHS document, dated May 13, says that while there won\u2019t be general food shortages in the U.S., the country is likely to face shortfalls in some areas. \u201cCOVID-19 probably will reduce the variety of food available in the United States as certain food processing facilities close for days or weeks to mitigate COVID-19 spread,\u201d the document says. \u201cThe food and agriculture workforce is especially vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 due to close working quarters and a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).\u201d\n\nWhile some consumers are already being caught by surprise as the site of empty meat shelves at the grocery store, the government has had multiple warnings. For over a month, DHS, HHS and FEMA reports warned of breakdowns in the supply chain, ranging from outbreaks of infection among meat-processing workers, to shortages of chemicals and equipment needed at those facilities, according to more than a dozen daily updates reviewed by Yahoo News.\n\nDHS, HSS and FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThose warnings came after an internal government briefing from the beginning of April, previously reported by Yahoo News, predicted possible food shortages, including for meat.\n\nSince that time, at least a dozen meat plants owned by meat giants Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods, Cargill, USA Holdings and JBS have paused operations, though only two are still closed as of May 14. At least 213 meatpacking and processed food plants and nine farms have confirmed cases, and approximately 14,259 meatpacking workers have tested positive for COVID-19, with 65 deaths, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network.","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1193,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/flour-shortage-baking-quarantine-coronavirus-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Katie Nixdorf', 'Elizabeth Mccauley']","title":"With quarantine baking on the rise, flour mills barely have enough bags to package flour with","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5ebef3123ad8611c4b363bb6?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Flour producers are seeing an increase in demand as Americans turn to baking in quarantine.\n\nOne mill in upstate New York is operating 18 hours a day to keep up, but barely has enough bags to package flour with.\n\nThe supply chain hasn't quite kept up with the shift in demand, which might be why flour is still missing from grocery store shelves.\n\nView more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.\n\nThese days it seems like everyone has picked up baking as a quarantine hobby.\n\nThat is, if you can find the necessary ingredients. Consumers across the country have reported a lack of yeast and flour at supermarkets since the pandemic started.\n\nBut flour producers are telling another story: that they aren't in danger of running out.\n\n\"There's not a flour shortage,\" flour miller Thor Oechsner told Business Insider Today. \"The mills are running. We can't get it packaged quick enough to get it out, the way that demand has flipped.\"\n\nOechsner is the co-owner of Farmer Ground Flour, a small company from Trumansburg, New York, that sells mostly wholesale to bakeries and food co-ops. Now, it has lost many of those orders, but demand from individual consumers and supermarkets is higher than ever.\n\nAnd that means changing how the flour is packaged \u2014 which is the real challenge for him.\n\n\"Our mill is set up to pretty efficiently build 25- and 50-pound bags going wholesale to bakeries. We are not super well set up to do 2-pound bags. I mean we can do them, but not at this quantity,\" he said.\n\nSince the flour is packaged manually, it is more time-consuming to fill smaller bags.\n\n\"For the first three weeks of the whole COVID-19 thing, we got more orders for 2-pound cases than we get normally in almost a year. So it's just this exponential explosion, these 2-pound bags,\" Oechsner said.\n\nThe packaging challenges may explain why some consumers are seeing flour sold in unmarked bags or large quantities.\n\nMeanwhile, the shift in demand means flour mills are working overtime. The mill that Oechsner co-owns is operating 18 hours a day. It's also impacting the supply chain, making it hard for flour producers to get the supplies they need.\n\nBut Oechsner says he still doesn't know if the increase in demand is enough to make up for the wholesale orders he's lost.\n\n\"I think at this point everybody at the mill is so hunkered down trying to fill these orders that nobody exactly knows how this is shaking out financially, just because it's seriously all hands on deck to try to get, you know, even come close to filling these orders,\" he said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1199,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/manhattan-district-attorney-drops-high-profile-case-over-coronavirus-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Greg B.

At issue are accusations that the lead prosecutor in the case, Diana Florence, withheld evidence undermining her star witness.\n\nOne of those defendants was Henry Chlupsa, a former executive of an engineering firm charged with bribing the witness, a city bureaucrat, for inside information to win multi-million-dollar contracts.\n\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber convicted Chlupsa in November following a three-week non-jury trial. Weeks later, Chlupsa's attorney, Nelson Boxer, learned that the DA's office had failed to turn over thousands of internal emails and interviews with the informant in which he claimed he never took bribes from anyone.\n\nIn January, Nelson asked Farber to vacate the conviction and dismiss the indictment.\n\nBid to 'conserve resources'\n\nIn a court filing Monday, Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Moore Jr. agreed the conviction should be vacated, conceding the DA's office hadn't handed over the disputed material as it should have.\n\nMoore insisted, though, the criminal charges against Chlupsa were still viable. But because of the COVID-19 restrictions on grand juries, the DA decided not to bring a new case against the now 77-year-old Chlupsa, Moore said.\n\n\"In an effort to conserve resources, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic, and for the other reasons described below, the People will not be seeking to re-present new charges against the defendant to a new grand jury,\" Moore wrote.\n\n\"In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, no new grand juries will be convened for the foreseeable future,\" he noted.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, grand juries \u2014 which in New York consist of 23 citizens meeting in a room to hear evidence \u2014 vote on whether to hand up an indictment.\n\nAn indictment is a formal allegation that must be resolved either by plea or trial. Law enforcement is required to bring a case to a grand jury within six days of arrest or release the defendant.\n\nBut with COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the criminal justice system and making it impossible for 23 New Yorkers to gather in a relatively small room, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order suspending that rule. The state Office of Court Administration shut down grand juries until further notice.\n\nDanny Frost, a spokesperson for Vance, said the Chlupsa case is the only major case dropped by the Manhattan DA so far due to the virus crisis.\n\nFrost said prosecutors handling other ongoing grand jury investigations are still able to issue subpoenas and continue pursuing cases. But he acknowledged that because the grand juries cannot meet in person, they cannot vote to indict.\n\nThat's put all cases pending when the virus struck are now in a state of suspended animation. The stuck-in-time cases include major white collar fraud, public corruption and racketeering prosecutions.\n\nProbes go on\n\nIt's not just a challenge for Vance's office: The city Department of Investigation, for instance, had multiple pending cases before grand juries when the virus all but shut courts.\n\nDiane Struzzi, a DOI spokesperson, said Tuesday that the agency's investigators are finding ways to work around the frozen state of grand juries.\n\n\"Not convening grand juries has had an impact on how cases move forward, but that situation has not resulted in the abandonment of any DOI case or a slowdown in DOI's work,\" Struzzi said.\n\nShe added that DOI investigators are instead \"focusing on case aspects that can be accomplished consistent with remote work and social distancing.\"\n\nThat's led to prioritizing investigations that involve a lot of email and records review over cases that require door-knocking and interviewing witnesses, Struzzi said.\n\nThe judge who convicted Chlupsa must still approve the motion to vacate that conviction.\n\nOn Tuesday, Boxer, Chlupsa's attorney, stated, \"After a long, hard fight, it's a big step towards justice for Henry.\"\n\nBut he disagreed with the DA's assessment that it was still possible to bring a case against his client. Boxer contended the case was fatally damaged by the DA's office withholding of evidence.\n\nThe Chlupsa decision by Vance marked the second time charges against defendants in the big construction bribery case overseen by Florence have been tossed. In February, another judge threw out the case against another engineer, Kyriacos Pierides, calling the scope of the withheld evidence in that case \"staggering.\"\n\nAs THE CITY revealed in January, Florence resigned from the DA's office and was replaced as head of Vance's Construction Fraud Task Force. Vance has said his office is reviewing the handling of the bribery case \u2014 scrutiny that Frost said Tuesday was ongoing.\n\nFlorence has said she turned over the material as soon as she learned of its existence. In her resignation letter, she charged she faced a \"hostile work environment,\" \"bullying\" and interference with pending legal cases while for Vance.\n\nThis story was originally published by THE CITY, an independent, nonprofit news organization dedicated to hard-hitting reporting that serves the people of New York.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1201,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/16\/21261213\/obama-criticizes-trump-coronavirus-speech","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Jill Colvin']","title":"Obama criticizes U.S. leaders\u2019 virus response in online graduation speech","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/96VMU6pF_kfjz1EKztZ5llu6Lqc=\/0x0:5063x2651\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19982260\/Obama_Graduation.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized U.S. leaders overseeing the nation\u2019s response to the coronavirus, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials \u201caren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d\n\nObama spoke on \u201cShow Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,\u201d a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.\n\n\u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Obama said. \u201cA lot them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d\n\nLater Saturday, during a second televised commencement address for high school seniors, Obama panned \u201cso-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs\u201d who do \u201cwhat feels good, what\u2019s convenient, what\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is why things are so screwed up,\u201d he said.\n\nObama did not name President Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials in either of his appearances. But earlier this month, he harshly criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic as an \u201cabsolute chaotic disaster\u201d in a call with 3,000 members of his administrations obtained by Yahoo News.\n\nThe commencement remarks were the latest sign that Obama intends to play an increasingly active role in the coming election. He has generally kept a low profile in the years since he left office, even as Trump has disparaged him. Obama told supporters on the call that he would be \u201cspending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can\u201d for Joe Biden, who served as his vice president.\n\nAs he congratulated the college graduates Saturday and commiserated over the enormous challenges they face given the devastation and economic turmoil the virus has wrought, the former president noted the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed while jogging on a residential street in Georgia.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest: A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe see it in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn\u2019t submit to their questioning.\u201d\n\n\u201cInjustice like this isn\u2019t new,\u201d Obama went on to say. \u201cWhat is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing, that the old ways of doing things don\u2019t work.\u201d In the face of a void in leadership, he said, it would be up to the graduates to shape the future.\n\n\u201cIf the world\u2019s going to get better, it\u2019s going to be up to you,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a perilous time for the nation\u2019s historically black colleges and universities, which have long struggled with less funding and smaller endowments than their predominantly white peers and are now dealing with the financial challenges of the coronavirus. Even at the better-endowed HBCUs, officials are bracing for a tough few years.\n\nObama\u2019s message to high school students came at the end of an hourlong television special featuring celebrities, including LeBron James, Yara Shahidi and Ben Platt, and was less sharp-edged than his speech to the college graduates. He urged the young graduates to be unafraid despite the current challenges facing the nation and to strive to be part of a diverse community.\n\n\u201cLeave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us \u2014 sexism, racial prejudice, status, greed \u2014 and set the world on a different path,\u201d Obama said.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1224,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dollar-general-tj-maxx-could-struggle-in-covid-19-world-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Mary Hanbury']","title":"Retailers with limited or no online offering such as TJ Maxx, Ross, and Dollar General are at risk of becoming 'irrelevant' in a post-pandemic world, analysts say","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5b22d7481ae66221008b4ed2?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"A select group of brick and mortar retailers was defying the retail apocalypse before the pandemic hit and reporting quarter after quarter of strong sales growth despite having a limited or nonexistent online offering.\n\nThese stores found a way to circumvent the threat of Amazon and e-commerce in general by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online.\n\nAnalysts say that the narrative has changed now and the pandemic could lead to a permanent shift in customers' shopping habits, putting any retailer without a strong ecommerce offering at greater risk.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US, a select group of brick and mortar retailers was defying the retail apocalypse and reporting quarter after quarter of strong sales growth, proving that stores still had a place in an increasingly digital world.\n\nWhile other brick and mortar chains crumbled as Amazon and e-commerce, in general, became more dominant forces, these select stores found a way around to compete by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online. This meant that many of them either didn't need to have an online store at all or at best, only needed to offer a very minimal e-commerce experience for their customers.\n\nTJ Maxx, Ross Stores, Primark, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree are among the retailers who fit into this category. These stores are using deals and discounts and the thrill of a treasure hunt shopping experience to keep customers coming back.\n\nAs soon as the pandemic hit, their situation drastically changed, however. Many of these retailers, which had relied almost entirely on in-store sales, saw business dry up almost overnight thanks to enforced store closings and having a limited online offering, or none at all, to fall back on.\n\nIn the short term, this has meant an immediate hit on sales but analysts say even as stores begin to reopen, it is the long-term impact of the pandemic that these retailers should be concerned about as it could result in a permanent change in how consumers shop.\n\nSome shoppers might be too scared to go back to stores and will switch to digital options for good, and the lack of any vaccine for COVID-19 means that there is a high chance of a second wave of infection, putting any store without a strong online presence at greater risk in the future.\n\nThe narrative has changed\n\nIn the past, off-price stores and dollar chains had defended their lack of a strong online presence by highlighting the simplicity of their business model.\n\n\"There was some justification in this because online selling adds complexity and cost and can erode margins. The continuous positive results from players like Primark and TJX [the parent company of TJ Maxx] justified their positions,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nBut \"the coronavirus crisis has changed much of this narrative,\" he said. \"In the short term, not being able to transact online has severely damaged brands without an online presence. Their sales have simply faded away and there is no means by which they can capture some of the demand that still exists. Potential customers have also diverted to competitors,\" and \"given the risk of a second wave or even a future pandemic, many of them will likely review their e-commerce needs.\"\n\nPhotos of lines outside TJ Maxx stores as they reopened in the US this week indicate that some shoppers are more than happy to resume their old shopping ways. But analysts say this won't be true of everyone, and while there might be a short-term burst after weeks of lockdown, many customers will continue to be cautious and avoid stores. If a second wave of infection was to hit later on, and stores were closed again, these retailers are back to square one.\n\nA recent survey conducted by investment bank Jefferies of 500 female shoppers, who had previously shopped at a TJ Maxx or Marshalls store, found that 60% said they would make some change to the percentage of their spending done in stores once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted; 28% said they would spend more on apparel online initially after stores reopened, and around 60% said they would avoid trying on clothes in stores after COVID-19.\n\nDoug Stephens, retail industry expert and founder of website Retail Prophet, said that until we find a vaccine for coronavirus or achieve some level of herd immunity that is long-lasting, we should not expect to return to \"the normal retail landscape\" anytime soon.\n\n\"Let's think about the people that are 45-50 and over,\" he said in a recent conversation with Business Insider. \"They are the highest risk group, and if nothing else they are going to be saying to themselves every time they have a need to go to a store: 'Do I really need to go to a store where I am potentially going to have to wear face coverings, be socially distanced, wait in line to get in, wear gloves, use hand sanitizer, or could I just order this online?'\n\n\"I really think it is going to come down to that,\" he said.\n\nRetailers without an e-commerce offering risk becoming irrelevant\n\nThe pandemic has meant that many more shoppers are testing online services than otherwise would have, becoming more comfortable with this option and possibly more loyal to it. This, in turn, puts extra pressure on those retailers that don't offer e-commerce services and makes them more at risk of becoming \"irrelevant,\" experts say.\n\n\"It's certainly possible they will survive,\" Calvin Carter CEO and founder of digital consultancy agency Bottle Rocket, said in an email to Business Insider, referring to these chains with no online stores or with significantly scaled back e-commerce services. \"But they will be irrelevant, which is the beginning of the end for any company in any industry. When you no longer meet your customers where they are and center your offerings around their needs, you immediately become both irrelevant and at risk of disruption from competitors.\"\n\nNot all of the e-commerce free or e-commerce light chains are so vulnerable, however, he said. While consumers might look to avoid busy malls and high traffic areas, Carter said that stores in rural areas, for example, are likely to suffer less. This could put a chain such as Dollar General, which mostly has stores in suburban and rural areas, in a stronger position. Dollar General has operated an online store since 2011.\n\nDollar General predominantly has stores in rural areas.

Once in the store, these retailers bank on customers spending more than they might have planned; the margins on each item are slim but they make money from customers buying in large quantities.\n\nMeanwhile, as online consumers \"tend to behave substantially more rationally, it is hard to fully replicate the essence of the shopping trip\" online,\" UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School Professor Katrijn Gielens told Business Insider.\n\nThere are ways around this, however. Carter suggests that TJ Maxx, or an off-price store of that kind, could consider having digital personal shoppers that help customers to discover items in new ways online, thereby replicating the treasure hunt experience.\n\nOff-price stores also face a separate challenge: the designer brands that they stock generally don't want customers to be able to find deals and discounts on their products online as it devalues the brand.\n\nTJ Maxx, which launched its online store in 2013, circumvents this issue by making it impossible for its customers to search by a brand on its site. But while this might keep vendors happy, it doesn't necessarily make for a slick online shopping experience. Both TJ Maxx and Marshalls reopened their websites this week with a cap on the number of daily orders, provoking a backlash among customers.\n\nGielens said that rather than use their websites for transactions, these stores could also look at how they could become digital versions of showrooms to give customers a better idea of what they might expect to see in stores to encourage any reticent shoppers that it is well worth their while to make a visit to that store.\n\n\"The opposite of showrooming, webrooming, is occurring more and more. Even when you do not necessarily want to push your consumers online, by offering insight into what you have to offer you can persuade them to visit the store,\" she said.\n\nThe cost of offering e-commerce services is a major factor for most of these retailers and in some cases, adding this option may \"destroy the very essence of their business model,\" Gielens said. If not carefully implemented, it could completely undermine their reason for their existence, she added.\n\nAt some low-cost chains, the cost of shipping and fulfilling the order of an individual item might even exceed the price of that item, making it near impossible to make money from this.\n\nGielens said these retailers really have two options: to double down on their competitive differentiation, i.e. not having an online store and work hard to keep giving customers a reason to visit (which would also mean making changes to make the shopping experience safer), or to invest in digital options and \"reluctantly admit that they must approach it [retail] in a new and different way.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1230,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/coronavirus-uncertainy-national-conventions-local-leaders\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Adam Brewster', 'Lacrai Mitchell']","title":"Local leaders weigh in on COVID uncertainty surrounding national conventions","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2016\/07\/22\/0f75a321-ef3a-41c2-b4c4-8d0ce849f9ff\/thumbnail\/1200x630g2\/44c907fae2caed967c7cbb5746e1b843\/2016-07-22t031025z1712104060ht1ec7m08shiqrtrmadp3usa-election-republicans.jpg","body_text":"There's no crying in baseball this year, because there is no baseball. There's also no basketball\n\nand no Olympics. America's favorite sports are on hiatus, and swaths of the nation are under stay-home orders. At least voters will be able to tune in for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, which are still scheduled to take place in August in Milwaukee and Charlotte, respectively. (Granted \u2014 watching Donald Trump and Joe Biden accept the nominations of their respective parties is not exactly the same as watching a thunderous dunk from Greek Freak Giannis Antetokounmpo.)\n\nLocal and state leaders usually look forward to the spotlight afforded by the conventions, which typically draw thousands from around the country. But this year is different, given the COVID-related constraints. CBS News talked with community leaders, business owners, health experts and elected officials in both cities about their hopes and fears surrounding the conventions this year.\n\nDEMOCRATS STRESS \"FLEXIBILITY\"\n\nDemocrats have already begun to make concessions, announcing their convention would be postponed by a month, to August 17 because of the virus.\n\nThis week, the DNC advanced a resolution to allow delegates to attend the convention remotely and empower convention planners to make health-based decisions about the event without going through the usual lengthy approval process, a tacit acknowledgment that the convention could look different this year. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said this week he expects and hopes to have \"an exciting and inspiring convention in August in Milwaukee,\" but \"does this mean that a precise format has been decided? No.\"\n\n\"We certainly don't want to plan an event that's going to put anyone's health at risk,\" DNCC spokesperson Katie Peters told CBS News. Peters said planners are \"building in as much flexibility\" as possible, to \"scale up or scale down as the nation continues to learn more about the direction that this health crisis is going.\"\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley says the data will dictate when officials need to make a decision about how to conduct the convention, but for now, \"I don't think that it is appropriate for us to talk about a timeline.\" Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says there remain a wide range of \"contingency options\" due to the pandemic.\n\n\"When people leave, I want it to be clear that the event posed no risk to public health,\" Barrett said.\n\nThis is Milwaukee's first national political convention, so a virtual convention would be disappointing to business owners, elected officials and local activists. Even so, some who favor holding the convention if it's safe are concerned about its safety.\n\n\"I don't want the people I represent to get sick and die because of this,\" said Democratic State Representative Daniel Riemer, who represents part of Milwaukee. He believes some sacrifices may have to be made and wants to hear assurances from party leaders and health experts.\n\n\"I would want them to look me in the face, so to speak, and to be able to look the people of my community in the face and say, 'You are no more at risk because this is happening and here's why,'\" Riemer said.\n\nThe convention was not only a chance to show off Milwaukee but also presented an opportunity to highlight the city's challenges, says Angela Lang, executive director of the Milwaukee group Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. But she, too, worries about the thousands of visitors who might infect Milwaukee residents.\n\nWe \"need to make sure that we're walking the walk and making sure that everyone is safe,\" Lang said. \"If that means not having an in-person convention and not risking the health and safety specifically of black and brown communities, we need to do that as a party.\"\n\n\"FULL STEAM AHEAD\" FOR RNC\n\nAs one of 11 cities to ever host both parties' political conventions, Charlotte will hold this year's Republican National Convention just eight years after the Democratic National Convention was there in 2012. Charlotte won a bid for the convention in 2018, over the objections of some residents.\n\nRobert Dawkins, political director for the grassroots community organization Action NC, explained that Charlotte residents feared the gathering could attract radical right-wing groups and white supremacists, but now, they might welcome it, if reluctantly.\n\n\"It's been hard and simmering bad feelings about this convention coming here for the past year,\" said Dawkins. \"You're going to find now that people are like, 'Charlotte's taken such a beating that if this convention goes along and has to still be in person, we're going to turn our noses and just let you do it just because COVID has cost us so much money.'\"\n\nIn April, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel tweeted the party is \"full steam ahead\" in planning for the event, which is scheduled for August 24-27. And the party is bringing in a health adviser to ensure the safety of convention attendees. McDaniel told the Washington Post that she's checking to see whether the federal government can provide protective equipment for both conventions.\n\nCharlotte Assistant City Manager Angela Charles told CBS News that while COVID-19 has changed what it means to host an event safely, she's confident \"we've got the right people around the table to host it safely and securely.\"\n\nCharlotte City Councilwoman-at-large Dimple Ajmera, who voted against hosting the convention in 2018, has been receiving numerous emails from constituents.\n\n\"One resident said, 'Well, how can we go from gathering up just a few people now, to 50,000 in August?'\" Ajmera recalled. \"Some residents have said this feels like a slap in the face and this is not about politics, it's about people's lives.\"\n\nAnother council member, Larken Egleston, who was one of four Democrats to vote in favor of hosting the convention, said it's too early to know how either convention should be modified, but called it \"foolish optimism\" to think it can be executed as originally planned.\n\n\"Some leadership around the RNC has said things like 'full steam ahead,'\" said Egleston, who is hoping to be a delegate for Joe Biden at the Democratic convention. \"That decision lies with our governor, with our state health director, with our county health director, and not with the president, not with the chair of the Republican National Convention.\"\n\nCity Council member-at-large Braxton Winston III predicted that \"we're in trouble\" if we can't figure out how to \"make democracy work in a socially-distanced reality.\"\n\nHe proposed top Republicans could meet at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, while state delegations meet at large stadiums in their home state, such as the Staples Center in Los Angeles or Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, to allow people to spread out.\n\n\"You're able to connect those folks through technology, but they are still able to meet together and caucus amongst each other,\" said Winston.\n\nNorth Carolina state Senator Rob Bryan is the sole Republican representing Mecklenburg County in the state's general assembly. He reiterated that everyone, regardless of party, wants to keep people safe.\n\n\"Conversations go much better if you don't accuse the other person of wanting to kill people or you know, 'you want to kill all these businesses, you don't care because you've got a job still,'\" Bryan said, echoing what he's heard from some North Carolinians.\n\n\"IF YOU HAVE INFINITE RESOURCES AND A REALLY GOOD PLAN...\"\n\nHealth experts in Wisconsin and North Carolina agree it's too early to tell what the pandemic will look like by convention time. It will depend on things like how well people follow social distancing and hygiene practices, testing and contact tracing abilities, as well as whether there's an effective treatment or vaccine \u2014 or flare-ups of the virus as states reopen. Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers this week that he does not expect to see a vaccine by the time school begins in the fall, which would put it out of the reach of the conventions, too. These metrics will likely determine what type of event could be safe.\n\n\"You're going to have a second wave, no matter when you open,\" said Dr. Colby Ford, of the University of Charlotte's Bioinformatics Department. \"It's just how large is that second wave going to be, and can we hold off on reopening or reconvening in social settings until we have a way to combat the virus.\"\n\n\"If there is a secondary wave, I think it's going to be difficult to really move ahead with plans for a significant convening here in Milwaukee,\" said Dr. John Raymond, president and CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin.\n\nExperts are concerned about bringing people from across the country into a single city for close interactions. Some states and cities may have the virus under control by August, while others may not.\n\n\"We have to put a bunch of people in the same place, the same city at the same time and that's really just asking for trouble because even if we reduce the number of people that come to the convention by 90%, it's still a lot more people in Charlotte than we normally have,\" said Ford.\n\n\"If you have infinite resources and a really good plan, it's possible,\" said Dr. James Conway, an infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Global Health Institute. He recommended testing attendees and workers at the convention site and other businesses, along with screening for temperatures, frequent and thorough cleaning of event spaces, \"abundant\" hand sanitizer, social distancing and masks.\n\n\"The testing literally has to be, 'Are you shedding the virus right now?' and doing that on a reliable basis, at least at the beginning, and ideally you would do it every day.\" Conway said. \"Anybody with a fever gets turned around and asked to leave and then goes and gets tested.\"\n\nBut mass testing and other precautions could come at a huge cost and might pull resources away from state and local officials. Barrett suggested Congress should provide funding to help cover health costs related to both conventions, as they do for security.\n\nCONVENTIONS COULD BE \"STIMULUS PACKAGE\" FOR BUSINESSES\n\nIn the past, convention week has been a boon for local businesses in the host city. The Democratic National Convention generated $230.9 million for Philadelphia in 2016 and brought in nearly $164 million for Charlotte in 2012, a record for a single event held in the city.\n\nAccording to a report by the 2012 Tampa Bay Host committee, the Republican National Convention that year produced $214 million for the city, about $25 million more than the 2016 RNC generated for Cleveland.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was part of a series of events that would put Milwaukee \"on the big stage with bright lights,\" said Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. In addition to the convention, the Ryder Cup is supposed to take place about an hour outside of the city, and the Milwaukee Bucks were a favorite to make the NBA finals.\n\n\"The big stage and bright lights \u2014 those lights are flickering,\" Sheehy said. \"They haven't gone out, but they're clearly flickering.\"\n\nSome businesses were banking on a boost from the convention to keep their budgets afloat, like the Middle C Jazz club in Charlotte. It had only been open for four months before it closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"The RNC to Middle C would be a stimulus package [of] far greater value than anything that we could get through the government to help us survive as a new important business in Charlotte,\" said Larry Farber, the club's managing director.\n\nDespite the potential economic benefit, most small business owners agree that health and safety are paramount. They're waiting for public health guidance on how they should proceed.\n\nBen Hebl, who owns Pourman's, a bar in downtown Milwaukee, has furloughed his 11 employees and closed his bar due to COVID-19. Even a small scale convention would \"cushion the blow,\" he says. But Hebl is worried about the risks that could come with people traveling to Milwaukee.\n\n\"I wish more than anything we could have it,\" Hebl said. \"If people started dying, I would be upset that we made that decision because I don't value money over human lives.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based businessman Eric Burg insisted that there is \"absolutely a way\" to conduct a convention in August, by taking precautions, like using LED-sanitized stations. The event side of Burg's company, Apple Rock Displays, has seen an 80% loss in revenue due to COVID-19 but his team stayed afloat by making PPE, including face shields and masks for businesses.\n\n\"There are ways to do this and everyone knows how to do it,\" Burg said. \"You just have to conquer your fear and be able to get comfortable with it.\"\n\nEleanor Watson contributed to this report.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1232,"url":"https:\/\/slate.com\/human-interest\/2020\/05\/coronavirus-restarting-business-child-care-travel-restaurants.html","publisher":"Slate","publish_date":"2020-05-17","author":"['Megan Wiegand']","title":"6,000 people on what they\u2019re comfortable doing in our new world: A Slate survey.","image":"https:\/\/compote.slate.com\/images\/437af4e1-e83e-4fb6-ac9b-d92a9969828c.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0","body_text":"As the national conversation turns, perhaps prematurely, from flattening the curve to reopening businesses and restarting life, we\u2019re all trying to figure out which parts of normal we\u2019re comfortable resuming. Is it OK to bubble with another family this summer? Is it fine to go to the beach? Is it time to return to the office? When can we have child care again? As we enter this next phase of the coronavirus response, what\u2019s reasonable and what\u2019s not seem more and more determined not by government decree but by who you are, what your circumstances require, and sometimes just by how you feel.\n\nLate last month, we asked readers what they think they\u2019ll be comfortable doing when their city or state lifts stay-at-home orders. In other words: When you\u2019re allowed to do these things, will you? More than 6,100 people responded to the survey, which included questions about getting back to office work and routine errands, child care, dining and entertainment, travel, and interpersonal habits we can\u2019t believe we had to ask about, like hugging.\n\nThis survey was designed to identify how Slate readers feel and should not be taken as representative of the U.S. population. But the results did show noteworthy patterns among respondents. A hesitation to resume activities runs deep, though people who identified as Republicans were more willing to get back to normal than those who identified as Democrats, often by margins of 20 to 30 percentage points. Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to answer a question with \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSome activities, such as going to movie theaters, shaking hands, or hosting parties, remain a relic of the Before Times. Others, such as going to national parks and visiting the doctor for routine checkups, seem doable to many. Men were more likely than women to pick \u201cyes\u201d\u2014as in, \u201cyes, I will do this thing\u201d\u2014in almost every category. Young people age 18 to 24 were more likely to say yes to getting back to the things they used to do, sometimes by large margins, particularly activities that involve socializing.\n\nMany respondents also wrote in to explain their answers to our questions and elaborate on their feelings. Quite a few parents, such as Dina in California, wrote about their need to get their kids back to day care or school: \u201cIt\u2019s just not healthy for any of us. \u2026 She gets way too much screen time, and we get no work done. It\u2019s miserable and unsustainable.\u201d Others wrote about the need to visit the doctor, get a haircut, or go back to work\u2014with proper precautions. Will in Alabama notes that some activities might not be a choice: \u201cMy \u2018Yeses\u2019 are actually \u2018Maybe, if I fucking gotta.\u2019 \u201d Others, such as Gretchen from Arizona, grappled with the uncertainty and anxiety of the future: \u201cAll of my \u2018I don\u2019t knows\u2019 are the ones that are the most emotional to me. They all seem like they are a bad idea based on the current situation, but I really don\u2019t think I can go an entire year without hugging someone. \u2026 My parents are in their 80s, and are out of state, and I don\u2019t want the last time I saw them to be the last time ever!\u201d Below are the results.\n\nWork and Routine Activities\n\nRoutine activities and errands\u2014such as returning to the office, shopping at nonessential businesses, and getting a haircut\u2014produced some of the most evenly divided yes and no responses, when compared with questions about kids, travel, and entertainment.\n\nReturning to the office tied with sending kids back to school for the largest amount of uncertainty in the survey, with 20 percent of respondents checking \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Many people wrote that they hoped to keep working from home, some permanently, but others had bosses who\u2019d made it clear that they were eager for employees to get back, or simply had to return for much-needed paychecks.\n\n\u201cI will go back to my job so I can pay rent. Period. I don\u2019t have the option of working from home, so when my store reopens, I\u2019ll be going back.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jessica, California\n\n\u201cThe boss of my company has informed us that we will be back in the office in two weeks, as long as the governor doesn\u2019t extend the stay at home order, and it looks like he probably won\u2019t. I\u2019m concerned about it. I share an office with someone, and I\u2019m getting some messaging from my boss about \u2018clean desk initiatives\u2019 and sanitation practices, but \u2026 if someone is an asymptomatic carrier, we are all sealed in a building getting prolonged exposure to that person, and maybe not knowing about it for weeks. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s a rush to get back in the office. We\u2019ve been handling everything working from home.\u201d\n\n\u2014Barbara, Louisiana\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a psychotherapist, so to go back to the office would require me to sit in close proximity to about 20 different people a week for an hour at a time each. \u2026 As long as insurance continues to cover telehealth sessions, I will keep doing that for the foreseeable future, even though I absolutely despise doing Zoom therapy\u2014it\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d\n\n\u2014Marissa, Illinois\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 78, have immunity issues, and have mild COPD. Getting the bug would almost certainly kill me. On the other hand, I need the money I get from working at the local supermarket. It\u2019s going to be a tough call.\u201d\n\n\u2014Norman, New York\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already shopping in person at liquor stores\u2014if I can do the mental gymnastics required to call that essential, I expect I\u2019ll be able to go to a nonessential business like my local bookstore once it opens.\u201d\n\n\u2014Margaret, Massachusetts\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely conflicted. Personally, I want to avoid crowds and avoid being in a store where I may try on clothes someone carrying the virus just tried on. However, I\u2019m also a fashion designer. My company, and my job stability, is partially dependent on people returning to stores. How can I want people to shop from the selfish perspective of hopefully keeping my job, while also not wanting to do that myself?\u201d\n\n\u2014Jessica, New York\n\n\u201cIt feels stupid dangerous to go to a hair salon, but I really need it for my mental health. I live alone and am getting increasingly depressed. My only coping mechanism is to put the pandemic out of my mind, but I\u2019m reminded every time I look in the mirror or hop on a conference call. I can\u2019t do blond at home, so I\u2019m hoping that if my hairdresser and I both wear masks and are the only ones there, it will be OK.\u201d\n\n\u2014Cece, Tennessee\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane thinking you can get personal services done like a haircut or mani\/pedi while socially distancing! I\u2019m not dying over beauty. I\u2019ll be DIY\u2019ing it until the virus is well under control. And the beauty police can take a hike for judging otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u2014Robyn, Virginia\n\nOur question about resuming routine doctor\u2019s appointments got one of the highest tallies of yeses. It also offered some of the smallest margins among different demographics. Men and women said yes to going to the doctor in nearly equal numbers. It was also the smallest margin between Democrats and Republicans, with 60 percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans saying they would schedule health care appointments. That still leaves plenty who remain apprehensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 40 this summer, with a family history of breast cancer, and will need to start getting mammograms. And my son needs to go to the dentist. But what is \u2018necessary\u2019 and what is \u2018elective\u2019 now?\u201d\n\n\u2014Sarah, Texas\n\n\u201cI have chronic health issues, that while not acutely life-threatening, do significantly impact my quality of life. I was undergoing testing in order to pursue new treatment approaches when my state\u2019s stay-at-home order was issued. It is hard to put those doctor\u2019s appointments on hold when I know I might find a way to feel much better.\u201d\n\n\u2014Breein, Idaho\n\nMany respondents hoped for expanded absentee voting or voting by mail for the remaining primaries and the November general election. But barring that, many swore to vote by any means necessary: \u201cswim through COVID,\u201d \u201cdraped in plastic wrap,\u201d and \u201ccrawl through clouds of Ebola\u201d were just a few choice phrases respondents used to describe what they would do to vote. One notable finding: While respondents age 18 to 24 were often more likely than their elders to say they\u2019d be comfortable resuming an activity, voting was one place where they backed off. Compared with respondents ages 25 to 65, fewer young people expressed a willingness to vote in person on Election Day. People over 65 were also less willing to venture to the polls.\n\n\u201cI will vote by mail but if not available because Republicans are trying to suppress voting, I will not be disenfranchised. I would rather be dead.\u201d\n\n\u2014Chris, California\n\n\u201cI would want to show ID when I vote in person on Election Day.\u201d\n\n\u2014Charlie, New York\n\n\u201cI would not \u2018feel comfortable\u2019 going out to vote in person. I, however, live in Mississippi and have no reason to believe that the officials of this state will make any allowances for voting other than in person. And I will vote.\u201d\n\n\u2014AZ, Mississippi\n\nChild Care\n\nQuestions about child care saw some of the thinnest gender gaps, with moms and dads in largely equal numbers wanting to send kids back to day care, school, or camp\u2014or keep them home. Sending kids back to K\u201312 produced a high level of uncertainty: 20 percent of respondents said they didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d send their kids if their districts reopened, the same percentage who were unsure about returning to the office. And the two are correlated for many respondents.\n\n\u201cI need some time away from my kids! Either a nanny\/babysitter or back in school. I don\u2019t care. I need a break!!!!!\u201d\n\n\u2014Sasha, Maryland\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t send my kids back to day care because \u2026 my kid and his day care is bar none the reason I get sick above all others.\u201d\n\n\u2014Graham, California\n\n\u201cI would hire a nanny or babysitter as soon as possible. \u2026 I have a newborn and a 6-year-old, and if I don\u2019t get help soon, I see myself spiraling into [postpartum depression]. I would hire someone I trusted who is also following proper social distancing as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2014Austin, Missouri\n\n\u201cOnce we [send the kids to day care], we may as well do everything else. I am so tempted, because I am struggling so much with my kids, but they are so touchy-feely and unhygienic\u2014if we send them to camp\/afterschool we may as well just have a houseparty and bob for apples.\u201d\n\n\u2014Brenan, Illinois\n\n\u201cIf my office \u2018allows\u2019 us to return to work, I assume that means work from home is no longer allowed. Therefore, I would need some sort of child care, whether I felt it was safe or not. Likewise with school. I don\u2019t have the luxury to choose not to send my children to school if schools reopen.\u201d\n\n\u2014Laura, Illinois\n\n\u201cMy high school kid is really struggling to focus in online school, and I\u2019m at work and not able to monitor him. It feels like the same result as if he had dropped out, and I\u2019m worried about his ability to keep up.\u201d\n\n\u2014Meg, Idaho\n\n\u201cThe kids need school and activities. My kids are 9 and 5. They have become anxious, lonely, and bored, all of which contribute to more emotional acting out and some noticeable depression (especially in the older child). It is worth the relatively small risk to send them out so that they can be more socially stable.\u201d\n\n\u2014Monica, California\n\n\u201cMy daughter has asthma and is high risk. I dread having to send her back to school before a vaccine. I may not, even if schools open. For us, this doesn\u2019t feel theoretical\u2014it\u2019s life or death.\u201d\n\n\u2014Monica, Washington\n\nWe also heard from a few teachers who aren\u2019t certain about the prospect of going back.\n\n\u201cWhen we reopen, I\u2019ll be headed to the school building, even if it\u2019s unsafe. I\u2019m dedicated to the kids and in a low-risk category, so if I get sick it\u2019s likely not the end of the world. I\u2019ll be fighting tooth and nail for safe policies, the right to wear masks (usually we\u2019re not allowed to cover our face or heads at school except for religious reasons), and even if other teachers are relaxing the rules, I\u2019ll be very strict with my students. They deserve to have an education without getting sick and killing their grandparents.\u201d\n\n\u2014Catherine, Washington\n\n\u201cIf schools go back in the fall, I have no choice but to be around 1,200 kids and 300 adults a day. I\u2019m terrified, as my partner is autoimmune compromised.\u201d\n\n\u2014Robin, Georgia\n\nFew respondents will be thrilled to send their kids to day camp if allowed, and even fewer were eager to send kids to sleepaway camp. But as with sending kids back to school, many parents are relying on camps to provide summer child care.\n\n\u201cI said yes to a lot of kid-based [survey questions] because working full time and having a 6-year-old has been impossible. I don\u2019t necessarily think these are the safest out of all the things listed, but I need some other form of child care, so I\u2019m willing to take the associated risks. My daughter\u2019s summer camp has confirmed it will run with lots of precautions in place, and I\u2019m planning on sending her.\u201d\n\n\u2014Celia, Colorado\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would send my child to day camp because I worry about that being a place the virus can spread. They are outside, and that seems safer, but I don\u2019t know that it is a place that is clean\u2014not washing hands enough, touching shared objects. It\u2019s hard to keep kids 6 feet apart. But if I have to go back to work full time, the only other option is sending her away to my sister, who is a teacher and would be off. And I hate the idea of not seeing my child all summer so I can work.\u201d\n\n\u2014Erica, Connecticut\n\nDining, Entertainment, and Socializing\n\nPeople age 18 to 24 were more likely than any other age group to say they are comfortable going to a restaurant, to a movie, or on a date. Entertainment-related questions also represented one of the largest gulfs between Democrats and Republicans, with Republicans expressing far more eagerness to resume these activities.\n\nPretty much everyone prefers outdoor to indoor dining, but there is a real partisan divide when you dig into the numbers. About 71 percent of Republicans are OK with eating outdoors at a restaurant, versus only 34 percent of Democrats; 50 percent of Republicans say \u201cyes\u201d to eating indoors with social distancing measures, while only 13 percent of Democrats say the same.\n\n\u201cI have been craving a meal at a certain Mexican restaurant that has free queso with your chips, a \u2018salsa bar,\u2019 margaritas you need two hands to hold, and the best carne asada tacos ever. It seems a small thing, but it makes me salivate to think about after over a month of cooking at home. Also, the restaurant is locally owned and operated, so my money will stay local for sure.\u201d\n\n\u2014Lori, Oklahoma\n\n\u201cAs much as I have missed eating out and want to support our local restaurants, I don\u2019t see how they can provide the distancing and cleanliness required. We are a tourist destination with most coming from Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. I am concerned that Georgia and Florida leadership has not taken the situation seriously and thus many tourists from those states could travel here carrying the virus into our restaurants.\u201d\n\n\u2014Geneva, North Carolina\n\nAbout even numbers would attend a dinner or host a dinner, but no one\u2019s in the mood for a party, with 89 percent of respondents saying no.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t think I could stand the change in behavior that would be necessary for an in-home dinner party. Every interaction would be so strange\u2014do we just freely pass dishes and wine bottles? Should we not all squeeze onto the couch for a movie night? How do board games work now? My friendships are strong enough to survive the awkwardness and boundaries, but it would be heartbreaking to pull ourselves back from connection again and again.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jess, Colorado\n\nAlmost no one wants to go to a movie theater: 91 percent of respondents\u2014the highest tally of the survey\u2014rejected the idea of going to a theater without social distancing policies. And 71 percent of respondents are hesitant to go to the theater even with distancing measures.\n\n\u201cI absolutely live for movies. I\u2019m 74. I have doubts that I will ever attend a movie again, I cannot imagine feeling safe.\u201d\n\n\u2014Penny, Colorado\n\n\u201cI would potentially go to an outdoor concert if it was guaranteed that we would all be really spread out and there were spread-out areas for going to the bathroom so not everyone was clustered around the port-a-potties, or ideally if it was short enough that I wouldn\u2019t need to use the restroom while I was there. And no food or beverage service because people would congregate in line. It would have to be a large venue with capacity capped at a much lower number than usual, or a small neighborhood concert in the park.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kelly, Oregon\n\n\u201cWhy not just drink a nice hot cup of Plague Espresso?\u201d\n\n\u2014John, Oregon\n\nDating showed one of the largest gaps between men and women, with 38 percent of men and 24 percent of women willing to get back to it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely single, and this experience has made me aware of how much I want a romantic relationship. Realistically, that\u2019s going to require some physical contact at some point.\u201d\n\n\u2014Yana, Pennsylvania\n\n\u201cI think for dates, it is just an acceptable risk for me. I cannot stay inside for forever, and I will let my date decide the level of contact they are comfortable with, but a walk outdoors seems pretty safe to me.\u201d\n\n\u2014Brian, North Carolina\n\n\u201cI feel like dating is so awkward normally. A date right now is just going to be even more awkward. People get so weird in general when you tell them deal breakers early on. I imagine trying to have a convo about social distancing\/when you can get close would just bring out everyone\u2019s inner weirdo. I\u2019m busy enough dealing with my own inner weirdo.\u201d\n\n\u2014Brenda, Texas\n\n\u201cTo go on a date, I\u2019d need to know more details about the other person\u2019s stance on mitigation\/distancing. In some ways it feels like any in-person meetup logistics conversation will sound a bit like a safer sex conversation\u2014what are your risk factors, what are your exposure risks, what are your mitigation practices, do our practices line up?\u201d\n\n\u2014Mary, D.C.\n\nTravel\n\nMany respondents expressed concerns about crowds and only wanted to venture to places close to home. But visiting a beach or national park was one of the more acceptable activities.\n\n\u201cThe beach is a big part of our lives. I think we could easily maintain proper social distancing while sitting under an umbrella, tossing a football, and boogie boarding. We have always tended to go to the beach before noon or after 5 p.m. anyway, just to avoid crowds and the hottest part of the day, so we\u2019d continue to do that. It would be a huge boost to our happiness and our ability to sustain social distancing for many more weeks\/months.\u201d\n\n\u2014Megan, California\n\n\u201cDespite consistent warnings from the governor, our open space and state park trailheads have been packed. We\u2019ve been avoiding those and will continue to do so, but we might consider doing some backcountry camping in the coming months. Definitely no campgrounds or anywhere with shared facilities.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kathleen, Colorado\n\n\u201cI think this may be an urban\/rural divide question. We live out in the sticks right near a national park, and have been going there regularly throughout lock-in. My wife and I rarely see a soul, and when we do, it\u2019s \u2018howdy!\u2019 and wave from a distance. If we still lived in L.A.? Definitely would not be going to Venice Beach or Griffith Park, nor to our own park now if there were a bunch of people\/cars. Ultimately, it\u2019s situational.\u201d\n\n\u2014Alex, Vermont\n\n\u201cRenting a vacation house just seems unethical right now. We don\u2019t want to unwittingly spread the virus to rural communities just because it would be nice to get away. And going to a beach or national park also seems unnecessary. We\u2019ll be able to do those things again but why expose others, and ourselves, to risk for something so optional?\u201d\n\n\u2014Robin, Wisconsin\n\n\u201cFor a rental vacation house, I\u2019m fairly confident in my cleaning skills so would come prepared to clean all surfaces and bring my own linens. I might also rent Saturday but not show up until Sunday to give anything in the air time to settle. And it would have to be in driving distance and not require a stop on the way.\u201d\n\n\u2014Amy, North Carolina\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of flying anywhere or staying in a vacation house, other than to meet new and interesting people to breathe on and get breathed on by in return? And isn\u2019t going on vacation an insult to all the people who\u2019ve been sent on involuntary vacation over the past two months?\u201d\n\n\u2014Jess, Texas\n\n\u201cThe only reason I say I don\u2019t know rather than no is because I already have a vacation booked for July. They make it so hard to cancel!\u201d\n\n\u2014Belinda, Missouri\n\n\u201cI had to cancel my honeymoon because of the pandemic, and as much as I am itching to get on a trans-Atlantic flight and take a sorely needed vacation, it\u2019s definitely not the first thing I\u2019m doing. I want to be clear of a second wave before I get on a flight.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ben, New York\n\n\u201cMy father has been locked down in a nursing home and can no longer work a phone. So, I have to go there and see him in person to assess how he is doing. I could be risking the lives of the entire nursing home and all the workers just because I need to see my ailing father. This is a horrible Sophie\u2019s choice, and I really should not do it, but I know I will.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mark, Texas\n\n\u201cI am terrified to visit my 86-year-old grandmother. We just lost my grandfather in December of 2019. Now not only can we not visit her, but she is also alone for the first time in 60 years. It breaks my heart that she is alone and sad. The idea of losing Gram is terrifying, so I am staying away.\u201d\n\n\u2014Melissa, Montana\n\n\u201cMy mother is 91 (and a half!) years old and lives in a different state. We had to cancel our trip to see her in April. The last thing I want to do is go visit her and carry the virus to her, in which case she would likely die from it. \u2026 But let\u2019s face it, at her age every day is a gift, and I don\u2019t want to put off visiting her for so long that she dies in the next year while I wait for a vaccine, meaning I would never see her alive again.\u201d\n\n\u2014Susan, California\n\nPhysical Contact\n\nShaking hands elicited one of the most decisive responses. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said no to handshaking, and many called the tradition \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cgross\u201d and hoped the pandemic would hasten its demise. Hugging was the single largest divide among age groups: 65 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would hug friends, compared with 36 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds, 27 percent of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 16 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds. About one-fifth of respondents said they were unsure about hugging a friend.\n\n\u201cI think I will really miss shaking hands, but it\u2019s not always necessary and just seems like both an unnecessary risk and an easy way to protect someone else.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sean, Ohio\n\n\u201cShaking hands, screw it, dumb tradition. Just hit \u2018em with the curtsy before they can offer and see what they do. Or, if you\u2019re truly second level, give them the extended-hand \u2018psyche\u2019 and hair brush-back. Frankly, that should be the new normal.\u201d\n\n\u2014Russell, Kentucky\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unsure about shaking hands, as I had a [tradesman] come over who held out his hand, and I shook it before I thought about it. Habit?

Unfortunately, there were no masks to be found, and the only thing drinkers were distancing from were their inhibitions. Just hours earlier, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had struck down a statewide \"safer at home\" order that, among other things, closed \u201cnonessential\u201d businesses and ordered people to stay in their homes, with limited exceptions. The order itself was fairly standard for states across America.\n\nFor weeks, Republicans had argued that their lawsuit against the order was needed simply so the legislature could have some say in the reopening plan. \"We want not a Democratic plan, not a Republican plan, we want a Wisconsin plan where we're all working together,\u201d Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke said May 7.\n\nBut now it appears their plan all along was to thwart any plan. Now that they\u2019ve been granted a seat at the table, Republicans have set the table on fire and thrown it out the window.\n\nGOP argued Dem order was confusing\n\nThe governor\u2019s unilateral \u201csafer at home\" order was set to expire May 26, at which point a gradual reopening would continue to take place. (Some business restrictions have already been lifted.)\n\nBut Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature challenged the order, complaining that the governor, through his health secretary-designee, had both cut them out of the process and exceeded his authority. They took Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to court, emerging victorious on Wednesday.\n\nThe ruling leaves Wisconsin without any statewide rule or guidance in place for businesses, citizens and local governments. After the decision, Republicans said they didn\u2019t see any need for any new rules, instead turning the state into a patchwork of local COVID-19 regulations, stretched throughout nearly 2,000 counties, cities, villages and towns. (Ironically, in the lawsuit, GOP attorneys argued that the statewide order was confusing \u2014 but without the order, every local government may now have different regulations and expiration dates.)\n\nThis is all taking place in a state that has weathered a decade of all-out partisan war, dating to the days of 2011 when tens of thousands of people occupied the state Capitol protesting Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s plan to virtually eliminate public sector collective bargaining. After an attempt to recall Walker failed, state politics has grown more bitter, culminating in Republicans forcing citizens to vote in-person during a spring election on April 7.\n\nFalse choices:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.\n\nThe lawsuit itself was based on a preposterous argument: The legislature argued that the health secretary\u2019s \u201corder,\u201d which, according to state statute does not require legislative oversight, was instead a \u201crule,\u201d which can be vetoed by lawmakers. But the extremely broad statute granting the executive branch emergency powers explicitly separates the two, saying the department \"may promulgate and enforce rules or issue orders for guarding against the introduction of any communicable disease\u201d (my emphasis). In fact, the legislature specifically added the authority for the governor to issue unilateral orders back in 1982, when the state was grappling with the rapid spread of AIDS.\n\nBasically, the Wisconsin Legislature argued in favor of disregarding a law passed by \u2026 the Wisconsin Legislature.\n\nRush to bars doesn't inspire hope\n\nNonetheless, as pointed out by liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet in her dissent, four conservative members of the court who won elections by campaigning against the idea of judges writing new laws went ahead and wrote a whole new law merging \u201corders\u201d with \u201crules.\u201d\n\n\u201cA majority of this court falls hook, line and sinker for the legislature's tactic to rewrite a duly enacted statute through litigation rather than legislation,\u201d wrote Dallet, adding that \u201cthis decision will undoubtedly go down as one of the most blatant examples of judicial activism in this court's history.\u201d (One conservative justice, Brian Hagedorn, sided with the liberal judges in the three-justice minority.)\n\nCoronavirus pause:People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon\n\nHaving been abandoned by the state, at least 17 communities immediately instituted stay-at-home orders of their own to continue the success the state has had in mitigating the damage of the virus. But on Friday, despite an attorney general opinion that said local governments do have the power to issue such orders as long as there are no criminal penalties attached, at least eight local governments rescinded their orders, leaving their communities unprotected. (The state\u2019s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, kept their regulations, believing they are lawful.)\n\nUltimately, it is now up to the state\u2019s citizens to practice responsible distancing, wear masks and take other necessary precautions. But the rush to get back to the bars does not inspire confidence that everyone will be taking this seriously enough. At the end of a long night of drinking, beer goggles no doubt make COVID-19 look pretty enticing.\n\nChristian Schneider, who lives in Madison, Wisconsin, is a senior reporter at The College Fix and author of \u201c1916: The Blog.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @Schneider_CM","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1245,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/05\/17\/856767177\/coronavirus-may-mean-lights-out-for-summer-camps-this-year","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-05-17","author":"['Tovia Smith']","title":"Coronavirus May Mean Lights Out For Summer Camps This Year","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/05\/15\/gettyimages-511095945_wide-3c47da3d9b7bb75824988b0dcbb1e62cec08a5d9.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Coronavirus May Mean Lights Out For Summer Camps This Year\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption PeopleImages\/E+\/Getty Images PeopleImages\/E+\/Getty Images\n\nSummer camps around the nation are grappling with whether or how they can open this summer, as the pandemic continues. The prospect is especially challenging for overnight camps, where hundreds of kids play, eat and sleep together, and the very idea of social distancing is completely anathema to the camp experience.\n\nLittle wonder a growing number of sleepaway camps have already capitulated to COVID-19.\n\n\"The cancellation of camp this summer is profoundly disappointing for all of us after what already feels like an eternity of frustration and uncertainty,\" wrote Shannon Donovan-Monti, executive director at Chimney Corners Camp in Western Massachusetts, in an email to parents this week. \"There are no words that can take away the heartbreak of depriving our children and ourselves of something that has given us such joy and connection to others.\"\n\nEleven-year old Maddie Prince was among the many Chimney Corners campers who took it hard. \"It makes me sad that I can't be with my friends,\" she said.\n\nCamp is where she \"grows up more,\" she said, and where she is happiest. \"You don't have any tech and it's really easy to forget all of your worries,\" she added.\n\nNational Will Summer Camps Open This Year? Will Summer Camps Open This Year? Listen \u00b7 4:52 4:52\n\n\"I would argue that kids need camp this summer more than ever before,\" said Dayna Hardin, president of CampGroup, which runs 15 camps from Maine to Michigan, including 13 overnight camps that are still hoping to open. She says the overnight experience might be just what the doctor ordered for kids who have been suffering through months of isolation and anxiety. And she argued that kids may actually be safer from infection at overnight camp than at home.\n\n\"We are looking at this like we are the castle,\" Hardin said. \"Our kids are going to enter the castle and we are going to pull up the drawbridge and we will be our own isolated community.\"\n\nBut a strict \"no in, no out\" policy would certainly crimp camps' style. It would mean no field trips, no visiting days and no socials or sports tournaments with other camps. Staff would have to remain on campus for days off. And laundry and food deliveries would pose challenges.\n\nCamp life inside the \"bubble,\" as some are calling it, would also change. Instead of playing tag, kids would have to fill their time with non-contact activities like making crafts.\n\n\"Camp is going to look very different,\" said Matt Fragala, managing principal consultant at Environmental Health & Engineering, the group hired by the American Camp Association (ACA) to recommend best practices and guidelines for camps. Specifics will depend on state and local mandates, but Fragala said recommendations will include constant disinfecting, spreading kids out for sleeping and eating at a distance and in shifts in the dining hall. The goal, Fragala said, is to \"control some of the mayhem the best way we can. It's going to be a change from business as usual at camp. But there's a balance we have to try to meet to keep everybody safe and to minimize potential risk.\"\n\nCamps are also expecting to have to split kids up into smaller units, said ACA president and CEO Tom Rosenberg. \"These would be like families where [kids] would be able to socialize somewhat normally,\" he said. \"But between the family circles, there will be physical distancing.\"\n\nThe same rule would apply to wearing face masks, according to Rosenberg. Campers would wear them when outside their \"family\" group, he said, and staff who interact with more than one \"family\" group, like a food service worker or an archery instructor, would likely have to wear a mask all day.\n\nCamps would be expected to regularly monitor campers and staff for symptoms of COVID-19, for example by taking temperatures every day. But whether camps would test for COVID-19 is an open question. Some camps see testing as a requirement; they won't even consider opening unless they could test kids before and during the session. But other camps say they would not test, relying on taking campers' temperatures daily and watching for other symptoms. That's an approach some parents find irresponsible.\n\n\"That keeps me up at night,\" said Fina Barouch, a Boston-area physician and parent of two campers. She said she will not allow her kids to go to camp.\n\n\"It only takes one person to be shedding virus when completely asymptomatic, and my concern is that this could turn into something like the nursing home pandemic, where it just spreads exponentially,\" Barouch said.\n\nThe CDC has issued its guidance for camps, recommending general precautions like social distancing, screening and extra disinfecting. The agency also directs camps to follow state and local laws, but in most cases camps are still waiting to hear what those will be, and they're growing increasingly frustrated that they don't have more information to help them make their decision.\n\nA few state and local governments have already decided to ban sleepaway camps this summer, including Georgia and Minnesota, and Connecticut is expected to do so. Officials in Vermont have indicated they want to allow overnight camps to open, with extra precautions that are still being worked out. But the vast majority of jurisdictions are still wrestling with the issue.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the issue comes up every day in conversation with other states.\n\n\"The tough part,\" he said, \"is figuring out, especially when it comes to some of the stuff that involves the joys of being a kid, figuring out some way to do this, where you have at least enough rules to make sure it can be done safely, but you don't destroy the whole spontaneous nature of what those are supposed to be about.\"\n\nIndeed, one camp director said an overnight camp that cuts so many core traditions would be like Disney World without the Magic Kingdom or Mickey Mouse.\n\nCamp consultant Lauren Kasnett Nearpass, co-founder of Summer 365, agrees that if the restrictions become so onerous that camp no longer feels like camp, it may no longer be worth it.\n\n\"If you have to remove the magic completely,\" she said, \"if it's going to look and feel so different, then perhaps you know, we just power forward to 2021.\"\n\nThe prospect of a watered-down camp experience gives pause even to die-hard campers like 15-year-old twins Sasha and Amanda Fine, who were looking forward to the perks and privileges they would enjoy as members of the oldest bunk at their camp this summer.\n\n\"Trust me, I want camp more than anyone,\" said Sasha. \"It's just that we can't have camp like this. Like it's taunting us.\"\n\nA month ago, Amanda said, her friends were all in favor of going to camp this summer no matter what. But now, she said, rather than a heavily compromised and shortened 2020, most would rather wait and have a \"normal\" summer in 2021.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1254,"url":"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/us-journal\/a-coronavirus-turf-war-in-klickitat-county","publisher":"The New Yorker","publish_date":"2020-05-17","author":"['Charles Bethea']","title":"A Coronavirus Turf War in Klickitat County","image":"https:\/\/media.newyorker.com\/photos\/5ebafee2e1c76e3f6a417886\/16:9\/w_1280,c_limit\/Bethea-SocialDistancing-Primary.jpg","body_text":"\u201cIt was unsettling,\u201d David Postman, Inslee\u2019s chief of staff, told me recently, referring to this stretch. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I was very alarmed. People were trying to outdo each other.\u201d Meanwhile, the Facebook page for the Klickitat County sheriff\u2019s office was quiet. Merrit Monnat, the farmer in Goldendale, told me that, after Songer\u2019s initial messages, people took the virus more seriously in the area, though maybe not seriously enough. \u201cYou still go to the grocery store and most people aren\u2019t wearing masks,\u201d she said. Keethler worried that the work that the state had done in March was at risk of coming undone. \u201cWe\u2019re entering into a period where some of our efforts are now being undermined,\u201d she said.\n\nThe day after Inslee\u2019s press briefing, I went to see Songer, in Goldendale. As you drive east up the Columbia River gorge, the green of the lower Cascades gives way to yellow, then to brown. Trees disappear. The central and eastern side of Klickitat County has been farming and ranching land for a hundred and fifty years. White turbines loom in the hills above the valley: the county now produces more wind power than any other county in Washington. For a long time, there was a lumber mill in Goldendale, and more recently there was an aluminum plant. Both those industries are gone. The city\u2019s largest employer is a waste-removal company: one of the biggest landfills in the country sits on the eastern edge of Klickitat, near the town of Roosevelt.\n\nSonger\u2019s citizen deputies include Ray Willis, a seventy-nine-year-old cattle and hay rancher, whom I spoke to outside his home. He was standing, unmasked, next to his pickup truck, which bore a decal signalling his membership in the Klickitat County Sheriff Posse Patrol. \u201cI listen to Songer before I listen to the governor,\u201d Willis told me. \u201cThat\u2019s for dang sure.\u201d He added, \u201cBob Songer\u2019s got a pretty good head on his shoulders. He thinks about stuff. I\u2019m not sure about our governor.\u201d\n\nThat opinion was echoed by Keith Kreps, a fifth-generation cattle rancher, who spoke to me inside one of his family\u2019s large, old barns north of White Salmon. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the guns last year,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cOur sheriff is usually right.\u201d For ranchers like Willis and Kreps, who can go days or weeks without venturing into town, a virus that is often transmitted in large gatherings does not seem all that personally threatening. Kreps operates on forty-four thousand acres. He was worried about the price of beef, which had plummeted, he said, when meat-packing plants began closing, and then rebounded a bit when some came back online. Kreps was afraid that, with the country entering a recession, and the market for beef falling, thieves would come to shoot his cattle, then sell it cheaply in neighboring communities. He said it had happened before, in the seventies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that we live where we do,\u201d Kreps told me, \u201cbecause we are away from where you have to do all that social distancing.\u201d Just then, a rare visitor pulled up: his daughter-in-law, who had come to say hello. Like Kreps, she was not wearing a mask. After they spoke, Kreps returned to his worries about the commodity business. \u201cThey shut down all these packing plants, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s hurting us big time, all across the country,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe need to get these guys back to work. Because if you have fat cattle to be your best prime rib, and they keep backing up, well, then they get fatter. Bigger costs more. We got to get those packing plants up, even if we got to go run around the clock.\u201d Kreps wasn\u2019t oblivious to the danger of meat-packing plants right now, he said. Along with nursing homes and prisons, meat-packing plants have emerged as one of the major sites of coronavirus outbreaks in the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get safe in the workplace,\u201d Kreps told me. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all the horror stories about bosses saying you\u2019ve got to come to work during the pandemic or you\u2019re fired or whatever.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to get this to stop. We\u2019ve got to develop a vaccine. That\u2019s No. 1. But it\u2019s going to take a long time. I\u2019m not a scientist, but I know that.\u201d On my way out, he offered his hand.\n\nBy the time I spoke to Kreps, Klickitat had had three confirmed coronavirus deaths, and just nineteen confirmed cases\u2014though only \u201cabout four hundred\u201d people in the county had been tested, Kristi Ridgeway, a clinical-division manager with the Klickitat County Health Department, told me. Most of the county\u2019s cases have come in the central zone, which includes Goldendale. \u201cSeveral of them, we were able to connect the dots\u2014they gave it to each other,\u201d Ridgeway said. \u201cThere was a gathering of folks\u2014I can\u2019t tell you more than that. Can\u2019t tell you the town. But it was in mid-March, around when the governor was discussing that we need to limit socializing in groups.\u201d Although Washington\u2019s stay-at-home order was statewide, reopening is happening on a county-by-county basis\u2014larger counties will reopen when they see a declining number of cases, and smaller counties will reopen after they\u2019ve gone three weeks with no new cases. All of this, of course, depends on widespread testing. Ridgeway said that Klickitat had the capacity for such testing\u2014\u201cup to eight or nine thousand, if we had to, in our hospitals,\u201d she said. The county has two hospitals\u2014a community hospital, in Goldendale, and a private hospital, in White Salmon\u2014both of which are conducting tests; hospital groups and clinics have volunteered to send mobile testing groups to the county\u2019s harder-to-reach populations, but this has not happened yet. \u201cUltimately,\u201d Ridgeway said, \u201cit\u2019s up to people to decide if they want to be\u201d tested, \u201calong with medical providers. Sometimes people with symptoms don\u2019t want to be tested.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1271,"url":"https:\/\/www.americanthinker.com\/blog\/2020\/05\/the_75pages_buried_in_pelosis_1815page_heroes_act_that_would_keep_democrats_in_power_forever.html","publisher":"American Thinker","publish_date":"2020-05-17","author":"['Dennis Sevakis']","title":"The 75-pages buried in Pelosi\u2019s 1,815-page \u2018Heroes Act\u2019 that would keep Democrats in power forever","image":"https:\/\/www.americanthinker.com\/images\/bucket\/2020-05\/220983.png","body_text":"Well, here you have it, folks.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/2020\/05\/18\/facebook-coronavirus-survey-small-business-struggles-sandberg-column\/5208116002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Sheryl Sandberg']","title":"Our new small business report shows scope of COVID struggles and optimism: Sheryl Sandberg","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/17\/USAT\/c8537b3c-1aba-458a-b41e-fe92a02e5a06-EyeSeeMe.jpg?crop=1199,674,x0,y6&width=1199&height=674&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"Sheryl Sandberg\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThink of your favorite small business. It might be the corner shop where you grab coffee on the way to work, the barbershop where you get your hair cut, or the restaurant you take your kids to on special occasions. Now imagine how much you\u2019d miss it if it disappeared.\n\nIf you live in University City, Missouri, it might be EyeSeeMe \u2014 a book shop with a difference. Inspired by their four kids, Pamela and Jeffrey Blair created a place where black children can discover role models and learn about African American history. It has become an important part of the community, serving people in their store and working with schools, day care and colleges to educate kids across the local area.\n\nBut the coronavirus pandemic turned everything upside down. Their store, like so many others, closed its doors. Pamela and Jeffrey have used all their creativity to try to make their business work online. They\u2019re pushing online sales, selling subscriptions to boxes of books delivered every two weeks, and hosting story time readings with authors on Facebook Live. But they\u2019ve had to rely on the goodwill of their community to stay afloat, raising money through a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nA measure of COVID-19 shutdowns\n\nSmall businesses like EyeSeeMe are the heartbeat of our communities, and they're in real trouble. The new State of Small Business Report by Facebook and the Small Business Roundtable shows just how much.\n\nBased on a survey of 86,000 owners, managers and workers in U.S. companies with fewer than 500 employees, the report is a sobering snapshot of the struggle they find themselves in. Since the first shelter-in-place orders, it has been clear that many businesses were going to take a big hit, but now we can hear from the people behind the businesses just how big it is.\n\nNearly a third told us they have stopped operating entirely. For the smallest businesses \u2014 those run by the self-employed or for personal income \u2014 the situation is worse. More than half are no longer operating. That is especially bad for women, who run the majority of these businesses.\n\nA particularly concerning finding is that fewer than half of those surveyed said they expected to be able to rehire the same workers when they reopen. And many businesses that remain in operation face two big challenges: cash and customers. Nearly three in 10 said the biggest challenge they face over the next few months will be cash flow, while 20% said it will be lack of demand.\n\nLike Pamela and Jeffrey, many are trying to pivot their operations online. Just over half said they were increasing their online interaction with customers, with more than a third now doing all their selling virtually.\n\nRunning a small business is tiring in the best of times. But as the report illustrates so starkly, the challenges of staying afloat during this turmoil can be overwhelming. Nearly half of all owners and managers report feeling burned out trying to take care of business and household responsibilities at the same time.\n\nFew expect their businesses to fail\n\nYet despite all this, there is huge resilience and a surprising amount of optimism. More than half of those surveyed said they are optimistic or extremely optimistic about the future of their businesses, and a small fraction \u2014 just 11% \u2014 expect their business to fail if conditions persist for the next three months.\n\nFacebook is in the business of small business. Some 160 million businesses use our apps every month \u2014 nearly one business for every 55 people on the planet, all using Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp to reach customers. Big brands use them, as do local coffee shops, barbershops, restaurants and, yes, bookstores. And for every one of those 160 million, there are people earning livelihoods and customers using products or services.\n\nThe State of Small Business Report is the first of an ongoing series tracking the situation facing small businesses across the country. These were planned before the virus struck, and we had anticipated that they would paint a much brighter picture of American businesses. Instead, the findings bring home the scale of the crisis our economy is facing and can point us to where help is most needed.\n\nAbove all, we hope that the optimism of small business owners is well-founded, and that future reports will tell a story of recovery and better times to come.\n\nSheryl Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook.

What would top that is if many were to drive away in the battery-powered cars manufacturers have devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to develop. It may take state aid to tip the balance in electric vehicles\u2019 favour.\n\nAutomakers\u2019 outlook is brutal. Assuming factories reopen in full in the second half of 2020, global vehicle production would still decline by 21% from last year, IHS Markit predicts, the worst contraction since the financial crisis. Reflecting such pain, the Refinitiv Global Automobiles & Auto Parts index has fallen by nearly one quarter.\n\nStill, the importance of Ford Motor and General Motors in the United States, Germany\u2019s Daimler and Volkswagen and China\u2019s Dongfeng Motor to their respective country\u2019s economy should put automakers at the centre of any post-virus stimulus plans. And the International Monetary Fund has called for governments to pursue a green economic recovery.\n\nThese environmental and economic issues converge around electric vehicles, which by rights should become more appealing to drivers now. Air pollution, after all, might worsen the disease, adding to the concerns about climate change that first fuelled their adoption. Shares in Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, which accounted for around a fifth of global electric vehicle sales last year, have nearly doubled in 2020, signalling that carmakers should flog more than the roughly 2% of total auto sales the segment accounted for in 2019.\n\nBut battery-powered cars are in general more expensive, even though the affordability gap to vehicles running on fossil fuel has halved over the past five years. Jefferies analysts reckon the recent oil-price crash has widened gas guzzlers\u2019 advantage to some $8,000 over the average ownership period. That\u2019s a big hurdle when joblessness has skyrocketed.\n\nGovernments can help by, say, rehashing for electric vehicles the popular cash-for-clunkers programmes rolled out after 2009 in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. Tripling the number of electric cars sold last year to 6.5 million with a $6,500 subsidy per vehicle, roughly the upper limit of what Germany currently offers, according to Deutsche Bank, would cost some $42 billion, or less than 1% of the combined 2019 GDP of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.\n\nPricey, yes, but hardly prohibitive.

REUTERS\/Nick Oxford\n\nThe complaint is the latest salvo from voting rights activists, who have filed dozens of lawsuits around the country to increase ballot access, such as universal vote-by-mail, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWisconsin was at the center of the battle in April, when a last-minute effort by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to postpone the primary election was stymied after Republican legislative leaders challenged his order in court. With many polling places shut down due to a lack of poll workers, many voters waited in long lines, risking infection.\n\nMonday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Madison, the capital, said tens of thousands of voters were disenfranchised after they \u201cencountered obstacles at almost every stage of the election process,\u201d including crowded poll places and thousands of absentee ballots that were either not delivered or arrived too late.\n\nThe burdens fell disproportionately on minority, disabled and immuno-compromised voters, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Disability Rights Wisconsin, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities and three individual Wisconsinites.\n\nA spokesman for the state elections commission, which was named as a defendant, declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nAlso on Monday, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey and other groups sued New Jersey in federal court, arguing that the state\u2019s signature-match requirement for mail-in ballots disenfranchises thousands of voters, particularly immigrants, minorities, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nThe two lawsuits join a plethora of others as activists warn that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could throw November\u2019s election into chaos without immediate steps to make it easier for voters to cast ballots by mail.\n\nMany of the lawsuits are backed by Democrats, who argue they are trying to protect voters\u2019 rights in a public health crisis and that Republican resistance is intended to disenfranchise minority and other voters who tend to vote Democratic. Marc Elias, the attorney leading the party\u2019s efforts, has pending cases in 17 different states\n\nRepublicans have argued that loosening restrictions could increase the potential for voter fraud, though examples in the United States are exceedingly rare.

One of the oldest of economic fallacies is that money is wealth; that is, the notion that if you create pieces of paper, put some kind of government stamp on it announcing that it is \u201cmoney,\u201d and spread it around among the members of society, you thereby conjure up from nothing actual material and other forms of wealth.\n\nMoney is a medium of exchange, some commodity or other useful thing that is found widely advantageous to use as a convenient intermediary to better facilitate the exchange of other goods and services one for the other when more direct barter transactions are found to be impossible to arrange or more costly to carry out.\n\nPrinting Money Does Not Magically Create Goods\n\nBut increasing the number of units of the particular item used as money does not, in itself, increase the physical quantities of all the other goods that people want to acquire through exchange to satisfy their wants and desires. These other goods that people actually want must be produced, manufactured, transported and made ready in the forms and at the places desired by members of society. They do not fall from the sky and do not miraculously appear by waving pieces of paper money (or their electronic and computer equivalents) above your head after offering some incantation to the \u201cmanna from heaven\u201d god.\n\nThis was all understood and even popularized for the general public by political economists in the early 19th century, when \u201ceconomics\u201d was the trendy and \u201cin\u201d subject about which any publicly minded and intelligent member of British and American society wanted to be knowledgeable and informed. Yes, there was a time, in spite of Thomas Carlyle\u2019s famous quip, when economics was not considered to be the \u201cdismal science.\u201d It was the subject essential to any thinking and thoughtful person to understand the social world in which he lived, and the political and institutional circumstances most conducive to the betterment of the human condition, especially the improvement of the poor.\n\nFor instance, Harriet Martineau (1802-1876), a leading British classical liberal-oriented feminist, abolitionist, social critic, novelist, and historian, successfully popularized the fundamental ideas of economics in a 9-volume series offering, Illustrations of Political Economy (1834), in the form of narrative stories of ordinary people through whom the principles of economic theory and practice were made real and relevant to millions of readers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn the first volume, for instance, a group of settlers in a faraway land are pillaged and plundered by a marauding band, leaving them with nothing to start over with other than their physical strength, the knowledge inside their heads, and whatever raw materials and wild animals were in their immediate vicinity. From this, she shows that the \u201cultimate resource\u201d is the human being himself with the creative potentials inside people\u2019s minds, combined with resolute determination to work, save, invest, and produce to create through time the prosperity and well-being that we call civilization.\n\nA Sack of Gold is Not the Same as a Stock of Desired Goods\n\nShortly after the initial disaster has struck and the little band has tried to get through their first day with nothing left to help themselves with other than their own heads and their own hands, two of the group reflect on their misfortune and circumstances, including that just having money is not to have wealth. One of them says,\n\n\u201cI wish that the people of England, who think that wealth consists in gold, and silver, and bank notes, would come here and see how much their money is worth in our settlement. A thousand sovereigns would not here buy a hat, nor a roll of bank notes a loaf of bread. Here, at least, money is not wealth.\u201d\n\nHis companion replies:\n\n\u201cNor anywhere else, as we may see by putting a very simple case. Put a man with a bag of gold into an empty house, in England, or anywhere else, and he will starve in a week, unless he is allowed to give his gold in exchange for what will supply his wants. But give a man, who has not a shilling, a room well stocked with meat, and bread, and beer, and he has wealth enough to maintain him for a week, or a fortnight, as long as his provision lasts. And this is a test which holds good all the world over . . .\n\nWealth is made up of many things \u2013 of land, of clothes, furniture, food and of the means (whether gold and silver or anything else) by which these things may be obtained . . . Poor as we are, we are richer than if we were in the midst of the sandy desert to the north of us, with a wagon full of gold in our possession. We have what gold and silver could not buy in such a place, food and shelter.\u201d\n\nThey go on to ruminate on the fact that though their situation is better than in a desert because there are edible plants, raw materials useable in various productions, and wild animals that may be eaten or harnessed to assist them in their work, none of these are, as yet, directly useful things until they have applied their knowledge and human labor to transform them into either the productive tools (capital) with which their work may be made possible or easier and more productive, or into the consumable and useable finished consumer items to satisfy their actual wants.\n\nThe first reminds his friend that, \u201cEven the manna in the wilderness would have been of no more use to the Hebrews than the carp in the pool to us, if they had not exerted themselves to gather it up. Food was never yet rained into the mouth of any man.\u201d To which his companion adds, \u201cAnd if it had been, he must have troubled to hold back his head and open his mouth. So, you see what conclusion we come to, even in an extreme case.\u201d\n\nForgetting that Production Comes Before Consumption\n\nMaybe because two hundred years ago so many more in the world were still so close to abject poverty \u2013 it is estimated that in 1820 the world population numbered barely one billion of which nearly 90 percent lived in serious or severe material want \u2013 that most people understood two centuries ago when reminded about the reality of their daily life, that production comes before plenty, that work is necessary if you are to have wealth. This is less the case today when out of over 7.7 billion people only about 10 percent are subject to the lowest of material circumstances, Far too many in 2020 think that the things of everyday life just \u201csomehow\u201d appear and are waiting and ready to be bought if you have but money in your pocket.\n\nSo, give people money and they can pay their rent or mortgage, buy food at the supermarket, and purchase medicines or shoes, because, well, all those things are just \u201cthere\u201d every day when and as you want them. Oh, yes, there can be panic buying, as was commonly seen in February and March of this year when people went crazy purchasing huge quantities of toilet paper, hand sanitizers, protective masks, and a variety of storable food items.\n\nBut these concerns all had to do with presumed failures on the part of politicians and private enterprises to know way ahead of time that they should have made sure there were more of all these and other things readily available in any maximum quantity that consumers wanted right then and there. It was just supposed to be there. Clearly another \u201cfailure\u201d of capitalism or inept government planning because the \u201cwrong people\u201d were in charge.\n\nWhat the government lockdown policy response to the coronavirus has highlighted is the fundamental and inescapable truth of what the 19th French economist, Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832), called \u201cthe law of markets.\u201d Contrary to the reawakened Keynesian mindset that all of our economic troubles are \u201caggregate demand failures\u201d arising from a lack of spending due to people not having enough money in their pockets, the dramatic collapse in production, the massive rise in unemployment, and the falling off in people\u2019s spending on final goods and services are all due to governments shutting down the \u201csupply-side\u201d of the economy.\n\nOur Ability to \u201cDemand\u201d Arises from Our Capacities to \u201cSupply\u201d\n\nAs Jean-Baptiste Say, and those who followed his reasoning, argued, there is always work to be done, since there are always human wants that are as yet not fully satisfied; and as soon as one such human want has been significantly fulfilled to one degree or another, the human mind looks ahead and imagines other things that seem attractive and desirable to have. As a result, work merely of different sorts is there to be taken up in even greater amounts.\n\nPeople may satisfy their wants and desires in one of two ways, Say explained. They may directly work and produce the goods they want for their own purposes. Few of our desires, however, can be fulfilled through our own personal efforts. So, the other way is to work and produce something that others might consider worth buying from us in exchange for what they can offer in trade; that is, goods that we want that either we do not have the ability to make for ourselves or only at higher costs than at which that potential trading partner can sell them to us.\n\nOf course, in modern society rare are the occasions in which we directly trade what we have for sale in exchange for what we actually want from another person. Usually, we first sell what we offer to someone interested in our wares for an agreed upon price in the form of a sum of money, and having earned that money from partly fulfilling someone else\u2019s wants, we use the money that we have so earned to then offer it to some other person in the market for that which we actually want that they are able to supply.\n\nI trade my labor services to the institution of higher learning that hires me to teach economics, and I then turn around and spend the money I\u2019ve earned on the goods and services I\u2019m interested in buying from people who may have no interest in economics, and certainly not in accepting some economics lectures from me in direct trade for what they have that I want.\n\nMoney Earned Comes before Money to Spend\n\nMy ability to demand what others may have for sale is dependent upon my success in producing and supplying something that some of those others might be willing to purchase from me, and from which I earn the money income as a producer that enables me to demand the outputs of others as a consumer. In logical, sequential time, my ability to produce, supply and sell precedes my capacity to demand, buy, and consume.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d I may be both demanding and supplying. But my ability to demand (money earned in my pocket available to spend) has come from having sold something in the past and earned that money from prior sales (even if the past is merely a month or week, a day or a few hours earlier).\n\nOf course, I may demand more goods in the present, in money terms, than I have earned from recently supplying in the past. But I can do so only if I draw upon my own savings from having spent less than I have earned in the past or by using the borrowed savings of others with the promises to pay it back with interest out of my current or future earnings.\n\nIn all of these cases of demanding out of what I have recently earned, or previously saved, or borrowed from someone else\u2019s savings, what that sum of money will buy, in general, in the marketplace \u2013 a dollar\u2019s purchasing power over goods available for sale \u2013 will depend on two things: how much of desired goods have been produced in the past and are available for purchase in the present, and the concurrent money demands of others also wishing to buy the same desired goods.\n\nSpeaking of the economy as a whole, if supplies in general decrease or total money demands increase, the prices of goods in general will tend to rise. Not all prices would rise at the same time nor proportionally with each other but based upon the relative greater scarcities of each of the fewer goods on the market as a whole, and the particular degrees of relative demands for specific goods out of the greater quantity of money in people\u2019s pockets in general.\n\nShutdowns the Cause of Falling Output and Rising Unemployment\n\nWhat we are witnessing at the present time has been a dramatic falling off in people\u2019s ability to demand desired goods partly due to government decrees, especially imposed at the state levels in the U.S., that have prevented interested and willing buyers from demanding all that they would like to purchase, particularly in the retail and service sectors of the American economy. This has led to a huge rise in unemployment in these sectors of the economy. At the same time, the imposed halting of production except for what state governments have declared to be \u201cessential\u201d manufacturing and supplying has resulted in massive layoffs in, yet, other sectors of the economy.\n\nIn the Employment Situation report for April 2020, issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (May 8, 2020), the government\u2019s official measured unemployment rate, for the economy as a whole, rose from 3.5 percent in February of this year to 14.7 percent in April.\n\nHowever, there is another measurement used by the BLS known as \u201cU-6,\u201d which includes not only those currently unemployed and looking for work during the last four weeks, but also those considered as only \u201cmarginally\u201d in the labor force, as those working part time but who want to work full time, and \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d who want to work but have stopped looking for a job. Using this more inclusive measure, the BLS reports that unemployment rose from 7 percent in February to 22.8 percent in April.\n\nIt is difficult to demand the outputs of others, when (depending on the measure) between almost 15 percent and 23 percent of the labor force finds itself not fully employed in the U.S. economy. This is especially the case in what the BLS categorizes as the \u201chospitality and leisure\u201d sectors of the market, in which the Bureau reports unemployment in April was 39.3 percent.\n\nThe government\u2019s lockdowns have, on the one hand, induced declines in production and output, at least in the short run, resulting in reduced supplies of various (though not all) goods. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in its estimate of the 2020 first quarter Gross Domestic Production calculates that GDP may have declined by at least 4.8 percent at an annualized rate.\n\nThe restrictions on retail shopping combined with the massive fall in employment has reduced the money demands for many goods and services, and the resources that are used in manufacturing. In the jargon of mainstream macroeconomics, the velocity of the circulation of money declined during the first three months of 2020 by nearly 15 percent (M-2) and by 9.6 percent (MZM), compared to the velocity of money in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nIf the lockdowns proceed to be loosened as they are in the various states, and if these trillions of dollars being created by the Treasury through massive deficit spending and through expansive \u201clines of credit\u201d by the Federal Reserve to support financially ailing businesses proceed as announced, it is difficult not to expect significant price inflation looking to the end of 2020 and into 2021.\n\nThe Need for Coordinated Productions Through Time\n\nPart of the illusion of just needing money to immediately assure and bring forth the goods wanted and desired arises from the failure to fully understand that all production takes time and any disruption of the processes and stages of production threatens the entire structure of investment and manufacturing.\n\nThe real time-structure of production has been implied in discussions concerning potential breakdowns in the interdependent global supply-chains connecting resources, manufacturing, transportation, and retail marketing to the ultimate consumer. All the stages of production through which goods sequentially pass, in their own required respective ways, rely upon intricate complementary coordination if those goods are to be continually forthcoming in the desired patterns and quantities, and when they may be wanted.\n\nThe nature and logic of these relationships may be captured in the following table:\n\nIn the table, above, the number of production steps to bring a particular good to market requires 5 interdependent stages of production, each of which takes one month to complete. Thus, if this good was wanted for consumer use in May of 2020, the production on it needed to begin at the start of the year, in January.\n\nIf the same good is wanted in the same quantity and quality in June of 2020, as well, its production process had to begin in February at the same time that the quantity of the good wanted in May was going through stage 2 of its production process. In March of 2020, the good wanted in May had to be going through stage 3 of its production process, while the good wanted in June had to be passing through its stage 2, and if this good is also wanted in its finished form in July had to be starting its stage 1 of production in March.\n\nAny stoppage or disruption in manufacturing processes and employments in any one or more of these production stages threatens, in principle, the ability for production to continue smoothly through time so the final good is available in particular amounts to the consumers wishing to demand it, period-after-period.\n\nThis highlights another aspect of Say\u2019s Law of Markets. If there are not to be \u201cgluts\u201d of some goods and shortages of others, each of these interdependent markets must be coordinated through the competitive interactions of supply and demand, in which prices serve as the guiding signals and incentives to direct people in the use of their resources, capital, and labor in the needed synchronized patterns both at a moment in time and through time as goods in process pass through their required stages of production.\n\nThe Fallacy of \u201cEssential\u201d and \u201cNon-Essential\u201d Productions\n\nGovernment\u2019s insistence on distinguishing between \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cnonessential\u201d productions and consumer goods are shown for the shallow misreading it is. Markets are interconnected and interrelated in such an inescapable way that what the government tags as \u201cnon-essential\u201d may be crucial for the maintenance and operation of other production processes that are labelled as \u201cessential\u201d by those in political authority.\n\nMarket relationships are too complex and overlapping for any but those in the production processes themselves at each of the respective stages of production to fully and effectively know and understand what needs to be done in changing market conditions to substitute particular resources and types of capital and labor from some parts of the structures of production to others as communicated and discovered through the relative patterns of prices and wages that convey the needed knowledge to make informed decisions so to keep productions moving forward with minimal breaks and disruptions in and across markets.\n\nThis is also why all the talk about loosening the lockdowns in \u201csteps\u201d over time misses the central point that all markets and the actions of the people in them are interconnected in ways that releasing some while delaying opening others threatens a successful restoring of productions and employments as soon as possible to rapidly escape from the government-created economic chaos in the shortest possible period of time without introducing other imbalances and shortages that need not happen, if not for continuing government involvement.\n\nWhat is needed, and now, is the freeing of all markets from the heavy-handed restrictive commands and controls of those in political authority, if we are to restore the economy and the employments it previously and presently could offer to all those looking for work at market-determined wages and prices. Any attempt by those in political power to guide and direct this process, regardless of the reason and rationale, only gets in the way of all the members of the society reestablishing their mutually serving productions as the means for acquiring the supply-side opportunities and capacities to demand the outputs of others.\n\nSaving Livelihoods Is \u201cSaving Lives\u201d\n\nIn this discussion I might be accused of avoiding why governments have intervened so pervasively and intensely into social and economic activities: to slow down and maybe remove the danger from the coronavirus through society-wide restrictions and restraints on people\u2019s freedom to move, work and earn. That is, \u201csaving lives\u201d by doing all that is possible to prevent or radically slow down the spread of the virus.\n\nBut \u201csaving lives\u201d is inseparable from saving livelihoods. The \u201csupply-side\u201d earning of livings is the only means of assuring that all the goods and services needed and wanted to meet all of our requirements are there when we want them. It enables us to earn the means for demanding what others are producing and offering on the market by having supplied some of what those others desire in reciprocal trade.\n\nMaybe I lead an especially sheltered life, but it never entered my mind that beer producers might modify their manufacturing in such a way as to be making hand sanitizing liquids, instead, to meet a suddenly much higher demand for the latter product to fight getting or spreading the coronavirus. I had not expected to drop off some shirts at the dry cleaners and discover that the owners were now producing and offering multi-layered cloth face masks on the premises to partly compensate for a large falling off of their regular business.\n\nAn essential purpose of allowing markets to be free and open in all circumstances is precisely to take advantage of what people can imagine, create, and produce to meet changing patterns of demand in their respective corners of society in ways that others might not and, indeed, cannot anticipate. The sudden anxieties in February and March about there not being enough ventilators to meet hospital needs for potential cases of respiratory failures due to the virus, saw numerous improvisations of workable substitute ventilator devices of different types, if the need had fully arisen.\n\nAs Friedrich A. Hayek brought out in The Constitution of Liberty (1960), personal and economic liberty is crucial precisely because we cannot fully know or anticipate what creative minds might imagine, the results of which we will be glad to have and benefit from, but which might never emerge if people are not free to discover and try:\n\n\u201cLiberty is essential in order to leave room for the unforeseeable and the unpredictable; we want it because we have learned to expect from it the opportunity of realizing many of our aims. It is because every individual knows so little and, in particular, because we rarely know which of us knows best that we trust the independent and competitive efforts of many to induce the emergence of what we shall want when we see it.\u201d\n\nThat is why we need markets to be open and free, now, for people be make their own best decisions about the trade-offs and risks to protect themselves and their loved ones from the dangers from catching the coronavirus, and in that process to free the supply-sides of the market from government shutdowns so people may earn the means of demanding what others produce for a return to the standards of living that are possible even in the face of the current health concerns.\n\n[Originally posted at the American Institute for Economic Research]","news_guard_score":"","mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1346,"url":"https:\/\/theduran.com\/dnc-hack-hoax-exposed-time-to-free-assange-video\/","publisher":"The Duran","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Alex Christoforou']","title":"DNC hack hoax exposed, time to free Assange (Video)","image":"https:\/\/149425939.v2.pressablecdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/assange-free.jpg","body_text":"The Duran\u2019s Alex Christoforou and Editor-in-Chief Alexander Mercouris discuss the complete collapse of the DNC email hack story, as the Crowdstrike president of Services and CSO has admitted under oath that he has no proof that Russia exfiltrated DNC emails.\n\nWith the stunning revelations from Crowdstrike, and the Michael Flynn entrapment at the hands of the Obama White House and the FBI, the question must be asked, why is Assange being held in a UK prison?\n\nSupport Free Speech:\n\nSubscribe to The Duran on YouTube \u2013 Find us on BitChute.\n\nThe Duran Audio Podcast:\n\nFollow on Soundcloud \u2013 Subscribe on iTunes.\n\n\u201cSix big lies you have been told about Russiagate\u201d authored by Nebojsa Malic, via RT\u2026\n\n\u2018Russian meddling\u2019 in the 2016 US presidential election has become an article of faith, not just among Democrats but many Republicans as well, thanks to the endless repetition of vague talking points, none of which hold water.\n\nIt all began with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) claiming in June 2016 that Russia hacked their computers, after documents were published revealing the party\u2019s rigging of the primaries. This was followed by Hillary Clinton accusing her rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, of \u201ccolluding\u201d with Russia by asking Moscow for her emails \u2013 the ones she deleted from a private server she used to conduct State Department business, that is.\n\nWith a little help from the mainstream media, which overwhelmingly endorsed Clinton and predicted her victory, her efforts to cover up her email scandal turned into Russia \u201chacking our democracy,\u201d eventually spawning the \u2018Russiagate\u2019 investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a series of failed attempts to derail Trump\u2019s election and oust him from the White House.\n\nLie #1: Russia hacked the DNC\n\nThe infamous US intelligence community assessment (ICA) of January 2017, and the Senate Intelligence Committee report based on it \u2013 as well as \u2018analysis\u2019 by actual election meddlers, among others \u2013 all claimed that the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin personally were behind the \u201chack\u201d and publication of DNC documents. These have always been assertions, and no evidence was ever provided.\n\nLast week\u2019s declassification of 50+ interviews in the probe conducted by the House Intelligence Committee revealed that the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, brought in by the DNC lawyers to fix the \u201chack,\u201d did not have evidence either.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s president, ex-FBI official Shawn Henry, testified that they \u201csaw activity that we believed was consistent with activity we\u2019d seen previously and had associated with the Russian Government.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nIn the same testimony, Henry also testified that CrowdStrike never had any evidence the data was actually \u201cexfiltrated,\u201d i.e. stolen from the DNC servers.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s feelings about the hack remain the only \u201cevidence\u201d so far, since the FBI never asked them or the DNC for the actual server, as Henry also confirmed. Meanwhile, former NSA official and whistleblower William Binney argued back in November 2017 that actual evidence showed a leak from the inside, not a hack.\n\nLie #2: Russia hacked Podesta\u2019s emails and published them in collusion with WikiLeaks\n\nThere is likewise zero proof that the Russian government had anything to do with the private email account of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, which a staffer admitted had been compromised when someone fell for a phishing scam.\n\nInstead, the key argument that WikiLeaks was somehow \u2018colluding\u2019 with Russia over the publication of the emails rests on a conspiracy theory promoted by the Clinton campaign staff, after RT reported on a fresh batch of emails before WikiLeaks got around to tweeting about them \u2013 but after they were published on the website and available to anyone willing to do actual journalism.\n\nIn fact, the existence of RT has been a major \u201cargument\u201d of Russiagaters; a third of the ICA intended to show \u2018Russian meddling\u2019 consisted of a four-year-old appendix about RT that was in no way relevant to the 2016 situation but lamented its coverage of fracking and \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019 protests, for example.\n\nLie #3: The Steele \u2018pee tape\u2019 dossier was irrelevant\n\nAs it later emerged, Clinton\u2019s claims about \u2018Russian collusion\u2019 were based on a dodgy dossier her campaign commissioned through the DNC and a firm called Fusion GPS from a British spy named Christopher Steele. It said that the Kremlin was blackmailing Trump with a tape of depraved sex acts in a Moscow hotel, with prostitutes supposedly paid to urinate on a bed President Barack Obama had slept on.\n\nIt was clearly ridiculous and entirely evidence-free. Democrats claimed it played no role in Russia investigations. Yet the FBI paid Steele for information from the dossier, and used it to justify a FISA warrant for the surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page \u2013 and with him the campaign itself \u2013 starting right before the election, and renewed three times.\n\nBy January 2020, the DOJ had formally disavowed the dossier and all four FISA warrants, along with any information obtained from them, saying \u201cthere was insufficient predication to establish probable cause.\u201d\n\nLie #4: General Michael Flynn treasonously colluded with Russia and lied about it to the FBI\n\nTrump\u2019s first national security adviser was hounded out of the White House after less than two weeks on the job, after media leaks insinuated he had improperly discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, violating the Logan Act, and then lied to the FBI about it.\n\nAfter FBI Director James Comey was fired by Trump in May 2017, he told the media the president had urged him to drop the investigation of Flynn, which was quickly construed as \u201cobstruction\u201d and used as one of the pretexts to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel into Russiagate.\n\nWhen actual evidence was finally coaxed out of prosecutors, however, it showed that the FBI sought to frame Flynn in a perjury trap, and that the people involved were Comey himself, his deputy Andrew McCabe, disgraced lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and others. All charges against Flynn were dropped.\n\nFlynn didn\u2019t even lie to Strzok and the other agent interviewing him \u2013 and the memo of that conversation had been first heavily edited, then destroyed. Basically, everything about the Flynn case has been as false as ABC\u2019s December 2017 bombshell report about his \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia that got Brian Ross fired.\n\nLie #5: Mueller found collusion, or at least Russian meddling\n\nWhen Mueller\u2019s final report came out, in the spring of 2019, it found zero evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d but insisted there had been Russian \u201cmeddling\u201d in the election. The only trouble was that he had no proof of meddling, basing it entirely on the above-mentioned intelligence \u201cassessments\u201d and his own indictments.\n\nA Russian company named in one of the indictments actually contested it in a US court and won. First, a federal judge slapped down Mueller\u2019s prosecutors for violating rules by presenting allegations as \u201cestablished\u201d and \u201cconfirmed\u201d facts and ruling that no link was actually established behind a catering company accused of \u201csowing discord\u201d on social media \u2013 a far cry from hacking the DNC! \u2013 and the Russian government.\n\nThe DOJ quietly dropped that particular case in March, just as coronavirus shutdowns were starting across the US, using \u201crecent events\u201d and a change in classification of some of its evidence as a face-saving excuse.\n\nLie #6: Paul Manafort was Trump\u2019s conduit to Russia\n\nPaul Manafort, who ran Trump\u2019s campaign between March and August 2016, was convicted of multiple counts of conspiracy against the US and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. However, despite repeated attempts by the media to present him as some kind of liaison between Trump and Russia, the entirety of things that got him in trouble with the law had to do with tax evasion on money he made lobbying for and in\u2026 Ukraine.\n\nDuring the two trials against Manafort, it emerged that he and his business partner Rick Gates had worked with Podesta\u2019s brother Tony to fleece Ukrainian oligarchs for years, and stash the profits in tax havens.\n\nThe Ukrainian officials who leaked the so-called \u201cblack ledger\u201d implicating Manafort to the US media were even convicted of election meddling by a court in Kiev, and the whole thing may have been solicited by a Ukrainian-American DNC contractor\u2026 The US media have been curiously uninterested in that particular \u201ccollusion,\u201d needless to say.\n\nPeel back all these layers of misinformation, like an onion, and what\u2019s left is an empty talking point, endlessly repeated by Democrats like Adam Schiff (D-California), that \u201cRussia hacked our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe charge is vague enough that it can mean anything, and deliberately so. No evidence is ever offered, because there isn\u2019t any \u2013 as the years of investigations and boxes full of documents have clearly shown.\n\nLiked it?

The study grouped them into color-coded \u201cclusters\u201d to chart how members interact, shift, and share links, and illustrates how differing stances on vaccination have evolved and competed over time.\n\nFor the study, investigators developed an innovative tool to map vaccine conversations among 100 million Facebook users during the height of the 2019 measles outbreak. Johnson noted:\n\n\u201cThere is a new world war online surrounding trust in health expertise and science, particularly with misinformation about COVID-19, but also distrust in big pharmaceuticals and governments. Nobody knew what the field of battle looked like, though, so we set to find out.\u201d1\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nWhile vaccine supporters (coded \u201cBlue\u201d) outnumber users with anti-vaccine views (coded \u201cRed\u201d) on Facebook, the platform has nearly three times as many anti-vaccination communities. According to the study, that makes it far more likely that their views will reach undecided people (coded \u201cGreen\u201d).\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nResearchers also found that pro-vaccine communities may be putting their focus in the wrong place. Researchers suggested that those concentrating on larger anti-vaccination communities might miss chances to influence medium-sized communities that are growing under the radar.\n\nThe study also noted that anti-vaccination groups offer lots of content about vaccines and other proven health treatments, such as safety concerns, conspiracy theories, or individual choice. With about 3 billion people using the social media platform, this content increases their chance of influencing Facebook users who are undecided.\n\nPro-vaccination communities typically focused their messages on the public health benefits of vaccination, according to the study. In a university press release, Johnson said:\n\n\u201cWe thought we would see major public health entities and state-run health departments at the center of this online battle, but we found the opposite. They were fighting off to one side, in the wrong place.\u201d \u201cInstead of playing whack-a-mole with a global network of communities that consume and produce [mis]information, public health agencies, social media platforms and governments can use a map like ours and an entirely new set of strategies to identify where the largest theaters of online activity are and engage and neutralize those communities peddling in misinformation so harmful to the public.\u201d1\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nUnder present conditions, one predictive model used by the scientists observed that anti-vaccination support could reach dominance in approximately ten years. Johnson said:\n\n\u201cThis is now a war over hearts and minds. The growing success of Red lies in the fact that Red now offers lots of attractive \u2018flavors\u2019 of health-related narrative, such as questioning role of big pharma, government, civil liberties, freedom of choice for their kids etc. By contrast, Blue is like vanilla, one flavor of message.\u201d1\n\nJohnson has continued to monitor the trends during the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak, and says targeting undecided individuals is critical. Referencing the cluster color coding, he explained:\n\n\u201cWith COVID-19, this is a perfect storm since Blue itself is not 100 percent sure about the science. Since the start of COVID-19, we already see Green communities in this picture turning Red. \u201cThe implication is that instead of trying to convince Red, which is very hard and may backfire to make them stronger, Blue should focus on intelligently engaging Green. Like in an insurgency, the battle should be for hearts and minds. Greens are much larger numerically in total, and could tip the balance away from herd immunity if not enough Greens get vaccinated against COVID-19, when a vaccine appears. \u201cThough the focus is on vaccines and COVID-19, the same applies for other scientific distrust, including climate change. Don\u2019t fight the Reds, engage the Greens.\u201d1\n\nSource:\n\nShares","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1353,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/analysis\/202005181079342969-instead-of-accusing-china-of-trade-deficit-trump-should-be-blaming-us\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":[],"title":"Instead of Accusing China of Trade Deficit 'Trump Should Be Blaming US Corporations', Economist Says","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/104874\/15\/1048741562.jpg","body_text":"US President Donald Trump warned on 14 May that Washington could potentially suspend all ties with China as part of its response to Beijing\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump also claimed that cutting off relations with China would save the United States some $500 billion.\n\nDr Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist who served as the United States assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy, has shared his views on the matter.\n\nSputnik: In a recent interview, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the percentage of GDP shrinkage in the second quarter is \"going to be very high\", even as much as 20 percent. How can the US sustain its economy during the crisis?\n\nDr Paul Craig Roberts: All economies that had closedowns are experiencing shrinkages, even Sweden, a country that did not impose a mandatory closedown to the same extent. The Swedish people on their own closed the economy in an effort to protect themselves from infection. America\u2019s economic problem is deeper and more long term than COVID-19.\n\nAmerican corporations offshored many manufacturing and professional skill jobs. These are high value-added, high productivity jobs that produced middle class incomes. These jobs were the ladders of upward mobility. When the jobs were sent abroad, the middle class underwent shrinkage and so did consumer disposable income or purchasing power, which lowered economic growth.\n\nThe movement abroad of jobs also reduced the state, local, and federal tax base. There was shrinkage in funding for state and local social services and infrastructure. Debt grew. To sustain aggregate demand, the Federal Reserve used an increase in consumer debt as a substitute for the missing growth in consumer income. This policy could work only until consumers were too indebted \u2014 mortgage, car, credit card, student loans \u2014 to be able to take on any more debt. Debt service used up consumer incomes, leaving little discretionary spending to drive the economy and leading to the current situation of \"debt deflation\".\n\nDebt deflation is a situation of falling income and employment because debt service uses up the income left after meeting basic needs of food and housing. To correct this problem requires US corporations to bring the offshored jobs back home. That is, the solution requires the end of globalism.\n\nSputnik: The only economy that is now starting to recover is the Chinese economy. How great are the chances that China could overtake the US as the global economic leader? What would the reaction by the US administration be to this?\n\nDr Paul Craig Roberts: In terms of purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is larger than the US economy. Unless China adopts the American practice of offshoring its manufacturing and professional skill jobs, China will continue to move further ahead of the US.\n\nSputnik: In the event we see further growth in the Chinese economy, shaking up American hegemony, how likely is it that we\u2019ll see further pushback from the US towards China, such as going back to a trade war, imposing tariffs for example, or trying to pin the blame for the coronavirus on Beijing?\n\nDr Paul Craig Roberts: The so-called \"trade war\" and tariffs imposed on imports from China are a misconception of the problem. The White House mistakenly sees the US trade deficit with China as the result of unfair Chinese trading practices. What the White House does not understand is that the \"Chinese imports\" are the products of US corporations, such as Apple, Nike, and Levi, that are produced abroad for sale in the US. When the US corporations bring their products to the US, they count as imports. So the fact is that it is the global US corporations, not China, that are responsible for the trade deficit. Instead of blaming China and worsening US-China relations, President Trump should be blaming US corporations.\n\nSputnik: There\u2019s been an ongoing argument that the Chinese political and economic model is the key to \u201csuccess\u201d in containing the flow and aftermath of COVID-19. To what extent would you agree with this? Has the Chinese model indeed proven its viability, despite being sharply criticised around the world?\n\nDr Paul Craig Roberts: Economists and politicians do not understand what the \"Chinese Model\" is. It is more than a mixed economy of government and private companies developing according to a strategic plan. The most important part of the Chinese Model is the manufacturing capability, technology, and business know-how given to the Chinese by the US corporations that moved their production to China. A large part of the US economy was simply ripped out of the US and sent to China. This is the reason that China progressed so much more rapidly than anyone thought possible.\n\nSputnik: In your opinion, which countries have been able to contain the outbreak, both saving the lives of their citizens and protecting their economies? How might the global rating of economies be reshuffled in light of this?\n\nThe COVID-19 infection and mortality statistics are not very good, which makes comparisons unreliable. Generally, testing is not widespread and the tests are not always accurate. Moreover, deaths are counted differently. What does seem to be clear is that Asian countries, such as China and South Korea, did a better job of responding to the virus and controlling its spread.\n\nThe US and Europe were slow to respond and were unprepared despite knowing what was happening in China. Possibly also, the Chinese and Korean populations are more homogeneous and more cooperative with government than the disparate, multicultural populations that massive immigration has created in North America and Western Europe. These countries are essentially Towers of Babel, which impedes cooperation.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1354,"url":"https:\/\/www.americanthinker.com\/articles\/2020\/05\/chinas_happy_harmony_hell.html","publisher":"American Thinker","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":[],"title":"China's Happy Harmony Hell","image":"https:\/\/www.americanthinker.com\/images\/bucket\/2020-01\/218224.jpg","body_text":"Dear World: Are you happy yet? This is not a story about coronavirus; it\u2019s worse. It is a story about War, Unrestricted War. The Chinese have promised the world Happiness and Harmony, but have instead lost the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d and delivered Hell. A few courageous experts have been right all along and this is a letter of thanks to them \u2014 and a note to the Americans who may want to follow. After you see the scale of deception unleashed upon our country and after your emotions calm, please take economic action! China is at war. Are we?\n\nGeneral Robert Spalding, in his book, \u201cStealth War: How China Took Over While America\u2019s Elite Slept\u201d gives it away in the title. But the stories of deception will send chills up your spine. Up front, the damage from the war is real. \u201cSimply put, 3.4 million US jobs vanished between 2001 and 2017 due to our trade relationship with China\u2026.with 75% of the jobs lost in manufacturing.\u201d All of this occurred under the false assumption that this is just \u201cnormal free market competition.\u201d How do you adhere to free markets when your competition is communist and does not respect the price system, private property, or the rule of law? Economic elites have no answer. Everyone should know by now that \u201cChina welcomes investment, but it won\u2019t let investors take their profits out of the country (China). Chinese companies set up shop all around the world, but the totalitarian CCP (Chinese Communist Party) puts all kinds of limits on foreign companies (USA) growing in China.\u201d Is this the free market system the elites have in mind? Adam Smith knew better.\n\nHow has the language and economic logic been so tortured and twisted in China\u2019s favor? Spalding shows how. subtly and effectively. \u201cIn 2017, when Chinese president Xi Jinping went to the annual World Economic Forum \u2013 the epicenter of globalization \u2013 in Davos, Switzerland, he said, \u2018We must remain committed to developing global free trade and investment, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation through opening-up, and say no to protectionism.\u2019\u201d It sounds like Xi is adopting the West\u2019s point of view, but here is where the CCP turns the tables, and why its influence is so subtle, cunning, and effective. In Davos, the crowd heard what they wanted to hear, \u201cbut when one parses what he (Xi) actually said and what was left unsaid, it becomes clear Xi offered no firm commitment to anything. There is no mention of adhering to international law, no mention of changing monetary policy to allow for the free flow of earnings out of China. To whom is Xi saying \u2018no to protectionism?\u2019\u201d Not to China \u2013 \u201ceverything about economic policy in China is protectionist. He\u2019s saying the West should not be protectionist, because that serves CCP goals. So in fact the leader of China was subtly undermining the laws of free trade and globalization while appearing to agree with them.\u201d This is stealth war. The elites are promised billions in short term profits while their own countries are strategically being destroyed. Spaulding\u2019s book details how we can get America back on track.\n\nBill Gertz similarly gives the premise away in his title, \u201cDeceiving the Sky, Inside Communist China\u2019s Drive for Global Supremacy.\u201d By 2018, the views of the elites above had finally begun to change. Gertz interviewed Michael Collins, the CIA\u2019s most senior analyst on China. \u201cChina has been waging a low-level war against the United States with the overall objective of preserving CCP rule\u2026A country that exploits all avenues of power, licit and illicit, public and private, economic, military, to undermine the standing of your rival relative to your own standing, without resorting to conflict,\u201d he said. Something that would never have been said even 10 years ago.\n\nBut this type of war can be every bit as lethal. On January 11, 2007, China launched the KT-1 rocket and obliterated a satellite in orbit, spreading tens of thousands of pieces of high-speed orbiting metal debris that will threaten both manned and unmanned spacecraft for decades to come. \u201cThe destruction of an orbiting satellite that day was a twenty-first-century shot heard round the world.\u201d General John Hyten of the U.S. Air Force said it was a \u201csignificant wake-up call to our entire military.\u201d The new space\/economic\/cyber\/technology war was now painfully in sight. Every technology imaginable, from navigation to your banking account, runs seamlessly through information relayed by these satellites. The signal was clear: your economic life is no longer safe. PLA General Peng of the Chinese Military Academy stated without irony that this activity \u201ccreates happiness for mankind.\u201d\n\nGertz collects 200 pages of evidence to refute this claim. We all know about the Uighur Camps, Tiananmen Square, the enslavement of Tibet, and organ harvesting. No one is happy in China. But the logic of war runs much deeper.\n\nXi Jinping, the leader of all Chinese thought and policy, respects three people above all: Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, and Adolf Hitler. The two he hates most are Deng Xiaoping (the Chinese reformer) and Ronald Reagan, who crushed Soviet Communism. Did you know that the highest-ranking Chinese official to ever offer to defect to the United States was rejected by the Obama administration? \u201c[Then-Vice President Joe] Biden\u2019s office overruled State and Justice Department officials in denying Wang\u2019s asylum request\u201d And as late as 2014, Hillary Clinton states in her own book that, \u201cwe agreed to say nothing about the matter and the Chinese were grateful for our discretion.\u201d This action gave up the most important intelligence asset imaginable. The economic rewards to the Biden\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s have been widely documented. The elites win. Americans lose.\n\nOther elites, such as Google, decide to get into China \u201cby secretly agreeing to assist the Beijing government in developing a special search engine, using proprietary algorithms that would assist in censoring content on the internet.\u201d In critique, another hero, Gordon Chang, \u201cviews Beijing\u2019s technology control system as a massive digital totalitarian experiment.\u201d The U.S. Big Tech sector is apparently all-in.\n\nGertz outlines the work of several other heroes who have spent their lives fighting and analyzing \u201cFinancial and Economic Warfare with Chinese Characteristics.\u201d Roger W. Robinson Jr. is a veteran financial warrior like no other. His work helped Reagan take down the Soviet economy, and he is now at work on China. He and Kevin Freeman of \u201cEconomic War Room\u201d have shown that America spends relatively little fighting this economic war. Economic attacks come in via leveraged derivatives or cyber efforts, and can result in trillions of dollars in losses. Yet, the perpetrators can remain undiscovered. The Chinese currently control parts of our active military thrift savings plan TSP and index funds at Morgan Stanley such as the MSCI index, which is expanding the Chinese share by the day. Many other U.S. financial instruments also fund the Chinese military and weapons systems currently aimed at us. The day will come when Americans demand change and find out that this change will damage their retirement accounts. This is stealth war.\n\nMany other warriors have joined forces in this new economic war. Steve Bannon, Matt Pottinger, Michael Flynn, Michael Pillsbury, and Peter Navarro have all come alongside the most powerful hawk on China in the White House, President Trump. \u201cFor Bannon, the new approach to China is to apply Reagan\u2019s strategy toward the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Reagan said in 1988 at a Moscow summit: \u201cHere\u2019s my strategy on the Cold War: We win, they lose.\u201d Trump has made clear that economic security and military policy are two sides of the same national security coin.\n\nI could show that the heroes above were all ridiculed by the sleeping elites and their hired gun typists, but time is short. The most powerful way to validate the work above, which I hope you share, is to show that the Chinese said practically all of the same things themselves back in 1999, in the book Unrestricted Warfare, by Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui \u2014 a book written by two PLA senior colonels from the younger generation of Chinese military officers and published by a PLA house in Beijing. They went on to become generals in China, so their writing in 1999 must have been prescient.\n\nQiao states \"the first rule of Unrestricted Warfare is that there are no rules, with nothing forbidden.\" \u201cWarfare which transcends all boundaries and limits, in short: unrestricted warfare\u2026.the rules of war may need to be rewritten.\u201d They go on to derisively explain how Uncle Sam\u2019s success on conventional battlefields has led to an American preoccupation with traditional warfare, while the weak do not have to be so constrained.\n\n\"Did the special nature of the Gulf War...trigger 'a revolution in military affairs' or not? This is ultimately a question of perspective [\u2026] Perhaps because victory was achieved so easily, to this day there are very few people in Uncle Sam's wildly jubilant group that have accurately evaluated the significance of the war.\u201d By \u201csignificance,\u201d they mean the undeniable fact that no one can beat Uncle Sam with guns or planes, and that therefore, other types of warfare will commence.\n\n\u201cWhether it be the intrusions of hackers, a major explosion at the World Trade Center, or a bombing attack by bin Laden, all of these greatly exceed the frequency band widths understood by the American military,\u201d they wrote two years before 9\/11. \u201cThe American military is naturally inadequately prepared to deal with this type of enemy psychologically [\u2026] and especially as regards military thinking and the methods of operation derived from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, by using the combination method, \u2026a completely different scenario and game can occur,\u201d they continue. \u201cIf the attacking side secretly musters large amounts of capital without the enemy nation being aware of this at all and launches a sneak attack against its financial markets, then after causing a financial crisis, buries a computer virus and hacker detachment in the opponent's computer system in advance, while at the same time carrying out a network attack against the enemy so that the civilian electricity network, traffic dispatching network, financial transaction network, telephone communications network, and mass media network are completely paralyzed, this will cause the enemy nation to fall into social panic, street riots, and a political crisis.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t quite match the condition spoken of by Sun Tzu, wherein \"the other army is subdued without fighting.\" However, it can be considered to be \"subduing the other army through clever operations.\"\n\nI have reviewed and praised the U.S. sources above because, perhaps, Americans want to understand all of the links and transitions above. The Chinese communists certainly do. I told you this story would not be about the coronavirus. It is about war.\n\nDavid Alan Brat is the dean of the Liberty University School of Business.

For decades, he has been incarcerated in federal and state prison for various convictions related to a massive international cocaine trafficking he built in the 1980s, which at its peak generated an estimated $2 million per day. But unlike many in his situation, Harris has the backing not just of justice reform advocates, but law enforcement members and elected officials, who have lobbied for his freedom in recent years.\n\nHarris is currently incarcerated in Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc, where his federal sentence is set to end in October 2028. It is a prison complex that has gained national notoriety for its failure to contain COVID-19; with more than 1,700 cases and 10 fatalities, the prison was recently sued by the ACLU over its handling of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to court filings by Harris\u2019 legal team, Harris is afflicted with Guillain-Barre\u0301 Syndrome, a disease where the body\u2019s immune system attacks the nerves, which can lead to full-blown paralysis. This, combined with the coronavirus outbreak, adds up to an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to Harris\u2019 health if he is not released, his attorneys argued.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Harris were to become critically ill or die while in custody, it would be not only devastating from a human standpoint for Mr. Harris and his family, but would eliminate a person who, following his release, would in all probability serve as a great source of healing and mentoring in the disadvantaged community of South Central Los Angeles in which he was raised,\u201d Harris\u2019 attorneys, Matthew Lombard and Bruce Zucker, wrote in a motion for compassionate release.\n\nOn top of that, Harris\u2019 motion argues that the U.S. Marshal service miscalculated Harris\u2019 federal sentence when he was sentenced to federal and state terms in the early 90s, and that Harris would be a free man today if not for their mistake.\n\nIn its response, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office argues on technical legal terms that Harris should be ineligible for a judge-ordered compassionate release because he still has a pending administrative appeal for release. They also argue that staff at Lompoc have taken \u201caggressive\u201d measures to reduce the further spread of COVID-19 in the facility, including testing the entire inmate population.\n\n\u201cNone of (Harris\u2019) arguments, including those related to COVID-19, justify a permanent, irrevocable reduction in his sentence,\u201d assistant U.S. Attorneys with the Central District of California wrote in a response motion. They later added that, \u201d Many of the defendant\u2019s allegations are based on his mischaracterization of the record and downplaying his material involvement in drug trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear when a judge will rule on the motion. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. ordered Harris\u2019 attorneys to file a 20-page reply to the federal government\u2019s response by May 22, according to court records.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in the Lompoc prison complex \u2014 which comprises two federal prisons \u2014 is widely considered the worst of any federal jail or prison, nationwide. Its number of confirmed cases has grown exponentially, nearly doubling from May 11 to May 17, according to published reports.\n\nAt FCI Lompoc, where Harris stays, roughly 80 percent of the 1,162 inmates have tested positive for the virus. There have been 10 fatalities.\n\nLate last week, the ACLU filed a class-action suit on behalf of Lompoc inmates, accusing the prison of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to stopping the spread of the virus. The Bureau of Prisons has not publicly responded to the suit.\n\nHarris\u2019 career and public persona\n\nHarris is famous for financing the start of Death Row Records in the early 1990s, investing $1.5 million in a partnership with the label\u2019s co-founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. The two formed a parent company for Death Row Records known as Godfather Entertainment, but business disputes between Knight and Harris ultimately curbed the partnership. In the 1990s, Death Row Records produced numerous classic rap albums, including Snoop Doggy\u2019s Doggystyle and 2pac\u2019s best-selling record during his life, All Eyez on Me.\n\nHarris also co-founded the Houston-based Rap-a-Lot Records, and funded the Broadway play Checkmates, starring Denzel Washington.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Harris was convicted of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in state court. He was also convicted in federal court of conspiring with members of the notorious Columbian-based Cali Cartel to distribute cocaine throughout the United States, earning a reputation as the king of Los Angeles\u2019 cocaine rackets.\n\nOver his decades in prison, though, Harris gained a different kind of notability; he formed the nonprofit Richmond Project, aimed at diverting youth in West Contra Costa away from crime. He became editor-in-chief of the San Quentin News and is credited with bringing the award-winning newspaper back from the brink.\n\n\u201cBeing a drug dealer is what Michael Harris did, not who he is,\u201d his attorneys wrote in the compassionate release motion, later adding: \u201cDuring his time as a drug dealer, he has said, he had grown physically as a male, but he acted in immature boyish ways, to the detriment of himself, his family, and countless others. After more than three decades in prison, when he leaves, he will be a senior citizen, but also he will leave as a morally mature man.\u201d\n\nHarris has publicly apologized for the cocaine dealing of his past numerous times, and maintained his innocence in his state charges. His attorneys wrote that the purported victim of Harris\u2019 conspiracy to commit murder conviction has since admitted his testimony was \u201cperjured\u201d and that Harris was innocent of his state charges. He was paroled from state prison in 2011, and immediately picked up by the U.S. Marshals and taken to Lompoc.\n\nHarris has also gained the support of numerous public officials \u2014 including former Obama advisor Van Jones \u2014 as well as politicians like State Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, and Contra Costa Supervisor John Gioia. Former Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus even wrote a letter advocating for Harris to be released from prison, in which Magnus described Harris as a \u201crare and valuable\u201d person whose influence was \u201cbadly needed\u201d in the Richmond community.\n\nLast August, a federal judge denied Harris\u2019 appeal for an early release under early release under Amendment 782, an Obama-era law that changed sentencing guidelines for federal drug convictions. It was widely \u2014 and inaccurately \u2014 reported at the time that Harris had been granted his freedom.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1364,"url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2020\/05\/18\/ex-as-manager-art-howe-hospitalized-with-covid-19-returns-home\/","publisher":"The Mercury News","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Gary Peterson']","title":"Ex-A\u2019s manager Art Howe, hospitalized with COVID-19, returns home","image":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/SJM-HOWE.jpg?w=1024&h=742","body_text":"CLICK HERE if you\u2019re having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device.\n\nFormer A\u2019s manager Art Howe, who tested positive for COVID-19 on May 5 is out of the ICU and back home, according to Yahoo Sports.\n\nHowe, 73, second to Tony La Russa with 600 wins in Oakland A\u2019s history, will remain in isolation at home for a few weeks, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cRelief, back in my own bedroom, it\u2019s just sweet,\u201d Howe said to reporters. \u201cI\u2019m finally feeling a little bit better.

I went up to him and said, \u2018Do you mind if I throw some knuckleballs?\u2019 I hadn\u2019t thrown it that much, and I wanted to work on it.\u201d\n\n\u201dHe said, \u2018Have at it.\u2019 The one thing you can take to the bank is Art\u2019s patience,\u201d Candiotti said, noting that managers flock to winter ball for the same reason players do \u2014 to get noticed.

The 63-year-old was the first person in St. Louis County to die of covid-19.\n\nShe was a \u201cgentle driving force for change,\u201d said Laura Kuensting, her committee chair for her doctor of nursing practice program at the University of Missouri, St. Louis College of Nursing.\n\n\u201cHer number one motivation was because she cared about the health of women, especially black women and their babies,\u201d Kuensting said.\n\nAt Barnes Hospital, now BJC Hospital, where Wilson-Griffin worked from 1981 through 2007, she was instrumental in creating the state\u2019s first maternal transport teams for high-risk pregnant mothers when she learned black women and their babies had a higher mortality rate in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer new venture was through her clinical scholarship project for her program, from which she was scheduled to graduate in December.\n\nKuensting and Wilson-Griffin were scheduled to meet on the evening of March 20 to review the proposal, but when the typically prompt Wilson-Griffin didn\u2019t arrive on time, concern washed over Keunsting.\n\nShe waited about 30 minutes for a response from Wilson-Griffin before tapping into her nursing network, which confirmed Wilson-Griffin\u2019s death. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d Keunsting said.\n\nWilson-Griffin\u2019s death underscores the disparity with which the virus is ravaging black populations across the country. The grandmother of four had been living with lupus for years, according to her daughter, Valerie Griffin. The disease is three times more common in black women than white women. Wilson-Griffin\u2019s health history and her age made her more susceptible to complications caused by the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson-Griffin\u2019s commitment to others had been recognized at all levels by friends, family and also the nursing community, which awarded her the 2019 March of Dimes Missouri Chapter Nurse of the Year in Women\u2019s Health and Obstetrics .\n\nHer death has left behind a stunned medical community that respected her passion for marginalized women and their unborn children, and a family in pain.\n\nCompassionate caregiver\n\nWilson-Griffin had a knack for doing the unorthodox for the benefit of those who needed her help, said her longtime friend and colleague Pamela Lesser, director of perinatal services at SSM St. Mary\u2019s Health Center, where Wilson-Griffin last worked as a perinatal clinical nurse specialist.\n\n\n\nThe model of care in the 1980s was for newborns to remain in the nursery most of the time after a birth, Lesser said.\n\n\n\nWilson-Griffin told the other hospital staff that the mother was going to take the baby home in a few days, and that the hospital wouldn\u2019t be caring for the infant after the hospital stay ended, according to Lesser.\n\n\u201cThe baby\u2019s staying in the room because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Lesser remembered Wilson-Griffin saying when a mother wanted her baby in her room overnight.\n\nMore stories Faces of the dead This is how they lived \u2014 and what was lost when they died. Read now\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time her intuition led her to help a patient in an unusual way.\n\nAs a U.S. Navy Reserve Nurse Corps member deployed overseas during the Gulf War, she helped a soldier who had endured sleepless nights because he heard voices.\n\n\n\nThe labor and delivery nurse had no expertise in this kind of medical care, but she wanted to help, Lesser recalled of her friend\u2019s active-duty time, which also required her to set up a field hospital that had nothing to do with birthing babies.\n\n\n\nShe told the distressed man that she would put the voices in the refrigerator overnight for him so he could sleep. The young man slept through the night.\n\n\u201cShe got in trouble because they said he was going to have a food aversion,\u201d Lesser told The Washington Post, laughing as she recalled the story.\n\nWilson-Griffin\u2019s tenacity for knowledge and advancing patient care inspired other nurses confronting complex problems to think: \u201cWhat would Judy do?\u201d\n\n\n\nLesser and Wilson-Griffin\u2019s collaborations on ideas and projects created such a tightknit relationship that the two joked they shared a brain. Sometimes mail would arrive to the hospital addressed to \u201cPamela Wilson\u201d or \u201cJudy Lesser.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many ways, she was more like a sister to me,\u201d Lesser said.\n\nSomething about her\n\nOf her achievements, the connection Wilson-Griffin formed with her daughter, Valerie Griffin, was one of her most prized.\n\n\n\nValerie Griffin was in her 20s when she met the woman who eventually became her stepmother. Her father, Tyrone Griffin, had been divorced for years, and his daughter watched him navigate the dating scene. When she met Wilson-Griffin for the first time, Valerie said she \u201cloved her instantly.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe new woman in her father\u2019s life had a compelling warm energy that effortlessly won over Griffin and her brother, Tyrone Griffin Jr.\n\nShe watched as her father courted Wilson-Griffin, the woman who would offer Valerie Griffin dating advice over dinners and a supportive ear during shopping ventures.\n\nThe two women grew closer when Tyrone Sr. became ill with lung cancer in January 1996. She lent her medical expertise to be hands-on with his medical treatment plan and comforted Valerie Griffin throughout her father\u2019s swift decline. His rapidly devolving health welded the two women together.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we would\u2019ve done without her,\u201d Griffin said.\n\n\n\nTyrone and Judy married in April 1996. He died two months later. She remained a Wilson-Griffin until her last day.\n\n\u201cShe loved my father,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cLoved him.\u201d\n\nWhen Griffin\u2019s mother died three years after her father, Wilson-Griffin salved her daughter\u2019s loss by becoming the maternal figure young adults need as they try to balance moving through the world and figuring out who they are.\n\nShe would be there for Griffin throughout her first pregnancy and in the delivery room when she gave birth to her daughter, MaKayla, who is now 14.\n\n\u201cThe minute I started going into labor, she started calling her friends,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cEveryone was looking for me and looking after me.\u201d\n\nWilson-Griffin remembered her daughter\u2019s gynecologist from the days when he was a resident at the hospital. At least 20 other people connected to Wilson-Griffin were in her daughter\u2019s room, cheering her on and caring for her through her delivery.\n\nHer presence would remain steadfast at soccer, basketball and field hockey games her granddaughters would play or violin recitals she found time to attend. Wilson-Griffin would take the girls and her grandson, T.J., on summer vacations that included a train ride to Chicago or caravan trips to the Deep South, where she would visit family.\n\nPray for Nana\n\nIn mid-March, as news of the novel coronavirus spread across the country and organizations started canceling large gatherings, Wilson-Griffin drove to Indianapolis to attend a professional nursing conference. Griffin fussed at her mom for deciding to go despite the risk.\n\n\n\nGriffin said this conference needed to be her last for a while.\n\nThe next week, Wilson-Griffin was hospitalized with pneumonia, a condition she had experienced before because of her lupus.\n\nWilson-Griffin told her daughter she might be able to see her once she was cleared by doctors. Griffin told her mom to keep her posted. She asked her daughters to pray for their nana.\n\nThe next day, Griffin texted her mom but heard nothing. She would eventually learn her mother had been sedated because her breathing had become labored. Wilson-Griffin was diagnosed with the virus on a Wednesday. By Friday, her dear friend Lesser suited up in protective gear to see her and to report back to the family.\n\nThe family never got to tell her goodbye.\n\nThe virus had caused her organs and health functions to shut down. Wilson-Griffin died before doctors could remove her from a ventilator.\n\nShe was buried with her late husband in Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis.\n\nBirthdays above\n\nAt midnight on what would\u2019ve been her 64th birthday, more than five weeks after Wilson-Griffin died, her granddaughters wished her a happy birthday in the family\u2019s group text.\n\n\u201cWe love and miss you already,\u201d one text read. The other wished her fun in heaven.\n\nThe family gathered at Wilson-Griffin\u2019s home later that day to release pillow-shaped balloons into the sky with messages for her eyes only.\n\nGriffin tied a red heart-shaped balloon with a handwritten note in turquoise script.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1371,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/health\/2020\/05\/18\/sea-sleaze-inside-underground-market-coronavirus-masks\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Desmond Butler', 'Juliet Eilperin', 'Tom Hamburger']","title":"\u2018No offense, but is this a joke?\u2019 Inside the underground market for face masks.","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/MC33IUURHMI6VEZCUKPHL374SM.jpg&w=1440","body_text":"The international market for desperately needed medical masks is riddled with fraud. Up and down the supply chain, from factories to hospitals, opportunists are benefiting from the chaotic market as prices have quintupled. Rampant price gouging and fraud has provoked dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of cease-and-desist orders, from major mask manufacturers as well as state attorneys general.\n\n\n\nWhile profiteers and crooks make their fortunes, medical workers across the United States are rationing masks, recycling them and treating infected patients without them. The federal government has taken steps to address the shortages, but emergency management experts say the efforts were distressingly inadequate. The Trump administration ignored early warnings that it needed to shore up its stockpile of masks and other personal protective equipment and has fallen behind several other Western nations in the race to secure them, documents and interviews show.\n\n\n\nCurrent and former government officials interviewed by The Washington Post say the most powerful country in the world should not have suffered from shortages of a basic, low-tech product.\n\n\u201cThe lack of preparation and coordination has been appalling,\u201d said Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who has advised Republican and Democratic administrations on planning for a pandemic.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn past disasters, the federal government, with its enormous buying power, took the lead in procurement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, federal inaction forced states into competing with each other for these scarce products. \u201d\n\nCanada moved more quickly to manage the crisis. Early on, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau focused on the logistics of shipping and manufacturing. He assigned a team to develop a plan to expand domestic manufacturing of masks and immediately obtain supplies from the world\u2019s largest producer of PPE: China. Canada\u2019s mask procurement operation has not been problem-free \u2014 some large orders have fallen through or not passed muster with inspectors \u2014 but overall the country achieved faster and better results than the United States.\n\n\n\nU.S. government efforts to procure masks hit another setback last week, when the Food and Drug Administration partly reversed course on an initiative designed to increase availability. Since April 3, it had been allowing a class of Chinese-made masks to be imported for hospital use despite not meeting previous U.S. regulatory standards. On Thursday, the FDA sharply cut the number of Chinese manufacturers cleared for import after finding that some masks did not provide the promised protection. The reversal has sown confusion among the Chinese manufacturers on which the United States depends for key supplies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented pandemic and while the FDA continues to take action to balance the urgent need of supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection,\u201d agency spokeswoman Brittney Manchester wrote in an email.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s long-standing estimate is that the United States needs 3.5 billion masks to respond to a serious pandemic. As of May 7, according to the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the private sector had either \u201ccoordinated the delivery of or are currently shipping\u201d 86.1 million N95 respirators. The government has lined up contracts to obtain another 600 million masks in the coming months, partly from U.S. manufacturers \u2014 such as Honeywell and 3M \u2014 that have ramped up domestic factory production.\n\n\n\nThe administration\u2019s most touted program to ship protective gear, Project Airbridge, has distributed just 768,000 N95 masks, according to a recent Post analysis of the latest FEMA records.\n\n\n\nWhile some states and cities report improved stocks of medical masks, many areas in the United States remain dangerously short of what\u2019s needed, according to interviews with state officials, nurses and other front-line providers.\n\nPresident Trump recently disputed such accounts, including one nurse\u2019s complaint of \u201csporadic\u201d supplies of medical masks, telling nurses gathered May 6 in the Oval Office, \u201cI\u2019ve heard we have tremendous supply to almost all places.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sea of sleaze\u2019\n\nAs the virus spread through parts of China in January, Wong searched fruitlessly in Hong Kong for masks for her young children. That\u2019s when she saw a potential business opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWong has worked in the high-stakes San Francisco real estate market and launched an Asia-based tech start-up. She knows the political contours on both sides of the Pacific. But she says she\u2019s never faced a more dicey business than dealing in masks during a pandemic.\n\nHer description of a daily dilemma to sort out legitimate deals from scams illustrates what U.S. states and hospitals encounter as they seek relatively small shipments of masks. Wong did not provide records documenting her volume of deliveries, but The Post confirmed at least two successful deals, including one with a Louisiana-based hospital chain. A review of business and court records in San Francisco shows that Wong built a sizable real estate business over the past decade, one that attracted civil lawsuits against her company and occasional liens for failure to pay taxes and franchise fees.\n\nTo secure mask contracts, Wong lines up buyers and sellers in a market that involves proof of funds on one side and proof of product on the other. Money goes into escrow accounts, while in-person or video evidence jokingly known as \u201cproof of life\u201d inspections are carried out to make sure the product really exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of that is normal in international trade. What is unusual, Wong said, is how much fraud there is.\n\n\u201cImagine what it\u2019s like to navigate this sea of sleaze to get people the masks they need,\u201d she said.\n\nOf all the potential mask buyers and sellers with whom she has come in contact, Wong estimates that less than 20 percent are real. Escrow provides some sanity: The buyer\u2019s money goes into an account controlled by an independent agent and is only released when the transaction is confirmed.\n\nBut before that happens, Wong says she has to identify what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. She regularly sees sophisticated forgery of financial documents and even videos of fake caches of masks. She provided examples to The Post that reflected forged financial statements from banks including Chase and PNC with balances ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars to $3 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal investigators have already charged a mask seller in the United States for wire fraud. On April 10 in Atlanta, federal authorities arrested and charged Christopher Parris, a 39-year-old businessman, after he offered to sell the Department of Veterans Affairs 125 million N95 masks. An affidavit filed by a federal special agent in the case states the businessman\u2019s credentials were suspect and the masks, as it turned out, didn\u2019t exist. Parris could not be reached and the attorney who represented him in a separate case in Rochester, N.Y., did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n50 states of chaos\n\nSeveral dozen state and local government officials, hospital executives and medical supply brokers interviewed by The Post in recent weeks echoed Wong\u2019s account, describing a process riddled with lies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Beshear, a Democrat, had been serving as Kentucky\u2019s governor for just a few months when the novel coronavirus hit his state. Beshear began holding 5 p.m. briefings each weekday, sometimes appealing for donations of personal protective equipment.\n\n\u201cThis is a Breeders\u2019 Cup of PPE,\u201d he said in April, using a thoroughbred racing analogy to describe a recent mask donation. \u201cIt comes from Kentuckians, knowing what we\u2019re fighting is the challenge of our lifetime and giving up the supplies that they have. It is the selfless, we\u2019re-all-in-it-together attitude that we are seeing from everybody.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Beshear said his duty is to his own constituents first. \u201cIf I have to compete with other states, I will compete with other states.\u201d\n\nThe mask shortage has been one of his most difficult challenges during the pandemic, though the state now has enough to expand testing significantly.\n\n\n\nAt one point, Kentucky paid $8.60 a piece on an order of 1,000 N95s, a number that wouldn\u2019t supply an average hospital for long.\n\nThe governor said he has competed with the federal government at times.\n\nHe recounted one incident where a company informed his aides that FEMA had rerouted Kentucky\u2019s shipment of N95 masks. \u201cThey were diverted to one of the hot spots. I can\u2019t argue with that, but it did add to our challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hospitals are securing enough to get by, though our nursing homes are struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe costs that we\u2019re having to pay are outrageous, but at the same time, this a hundred-year pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe same problems are filtering down to local governments across the country. Andrew Hime, a purchasing agent for Maryland\u2019s Anne Arundel County, says he has been forced to navigate the treacherous foreign markets \u2014 an unfamiliar assignment for a local official.\n\n\u201cThere are people we\u2019ve never dealt with before, and we\u2019re going to pay five times the normal price,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re the only folks who are telling me that they can get product at a certain date.\u201d\n\nBefore the crisis, top quality N95 masks traded for about a dollar apiece, but those days are gone as global demand has shot way past supply. Hime says he is bombarded with offers that are steadily getting more expensive.\n\nAmong a bevy of promotional fliers is one decorated with a fuchsia-colored banner from Ontario-based Vanguard Pharma offering N95s for $6.30 each in mid-April. The company advertises itself on its website as \u201csalesforce solutions\u201d for the pharmaceutical industry but says nothing about sales of masks or other protective equipment.\n\nCanadian antitrust lawyer Antonio Di Domenico, an expert in price-gouging laws, said that such markups could be a problem. The U.S. leading manufacturer of medical masks, 3M, says it has not changed the price it charges for the masks as a result of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that companies are retailing N95 masks for large multiples over 3M\u2019s list price \u2014 and there is evidence that their costs associated with bringing them to market do not justify the markup \u2014 then they could be exposed to prosecution under Ontario\u2019s recently enacted price-gouging measures,\u201d Di Domenico said.\n\nExecutives from Vanguard Pharma did not return emails, calls or texts seeking comment this week.\n\nEven a state behemoth like California has been beset by problems as it sought to obtain masks. On Monday, state officials were grilled by California State Assembly oversight committee looking into several troubled masks deals. The questions focused on the state\u2019s decision in March to buy 100 million N95 masks from a new supplier, Blue Flame Medical. The state of Maryland terminated a contract earlier this month with Blue Flame after state officials said it failed to deliver on a $12.5 million contract for masks and other equipment.\n\nA lawyer for Blue Flame said the company was acting in good faith in its dealings with California, Maryland and other clients.\n\nIn California, legislators wanted to know why the state contracted for such a huge number of masks with a company that had no track record. The state halted the contract and got an immediate refund after receiving a warning from Blue Flame\u2019s bank.\n\n\u201cThe sense of urgency and panic, trying to get supplies, rushing to compete with the federal government and other states, created the need for expediency,\u201d the state\u2019s treasurer, Fiona Ma, told legislators at the hearing.\n\nCalifornia has also ordered 375 million N95s from BYD Precision Manufacture that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined this month did not meet all of its certifications. The firm has described the problems as \u201ceasily fixable,\u201d and the state won\u2019t have to pay until the masks win federal approval.\n\nAt every level, government officials are also having to find ways to filter out the crooks, gougers and incompetent players who have moved to take advantage of the crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all taken a rhythm in government that government ain\u2019t used to,\u201d said Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D). Even now, he would welcome federal officials stepping in to make mass purchases. \u201cBut we can\u2019t rely on the federal government.\u201d\n\nHHS officials were warned about this potential shortfall in late January, when one of America\u2019s major mask manufacturers emailed former HHS official Rick Bright, offering to open the company\u2019s closed factories to boost domestic production of masks. While Bright warned department officials of the need to rebuild the stockpile, according to a whistleblower complaint, no one took Prestige Ameritech chief executive Mike Bowen up on his offer.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) said in an interview that the warnings the administration received in January to bolster the nation\u2019s stockpile amounted to \u201ca flashing red light.\u201d\n\n\u201cWords are inadequate to describe the inaction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of this was preventable. It did not have to happen this way.\u201d\n\n\u2018Is this a joke?\u2019\n\nIn mid-March, a White House task force assembled by Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and staffed by inexperienced volunteers began vetting potential suppliers to import masks from abroad.\n\nIn an email exchange from late March obtained by The Post, an executive at an Australian trading company expressed bewilderment to one of the volunteers about the administration\u2019s informal and disjointed approach to entrust such a critical mission to a group of novices. The Post withheld the names of the people in the correspondence as a condition of describing the email exchange.\n\nThe executive, who is a U.S.-based American citizen, was working with the task force to help the State Department navigate the supply chain and source masks from a factory in China.\n\n\u201cI am a volunteer working on the White House Task Force combating COVID-19,\u201d the task force member wrote to the executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for a while now and have outlined a process to make everything move smoothly.\u201d\n\nThe task force member outlined a multistep process and included a link to a U.S. procurement website. He said the team would require an inspection of the factory to proceed.\n\n\u201cNo offense, but is this a joke?\u201d the executive replied. \u201cThe world is burning down, you guys are volunteers, who is coordinating this? Volunteers?\u201d\n\nThe executive warned that the United States was already behind in the race to secure masks.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s fix this.\u201d\n\nKushner\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment about the email exchange, though the White House senior adviser has defended his volunteers in a statement. \u201cThe bottom line is that this program sourced tens of millions of masks and essential PPE in record time and Americans who needed ventilators received ventilators,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cThese volunteers are true patriots.\u201d\n\nBy the time the task force started reaching out to find new suppliers of N95 masks, it may have already been too late for the United States to make a big move.\n\nChristopher Kirchhoff, who was director for strategic planning on the National Security Council in the Obama administration, says there were two ways to make sure the United States had enough critical supplies to handle the crisis.\n\n\u201cUse the free market. Or use the federal departments whose mission it is to source and allocate scarce resources in a public emergency.\u201d\n\nTrump has been reluctant to make broad use of federal power, such as invoking the Defense Production Act, the Korean War-era statute that gives presidents the authority over factories and supply chains to secure critical equipment.\n\nThe shortage has forced American hospitals, fire departments and paramedics into agonizing choices this spring to not resuscitate infected patients who go into cardiac arrest because of concern for medical staff members.\n\nTrump briefly invoked the Defense Production Act, requiring 3M to cease delivering masks to foreign buyers who had contracted for them. But the president\u2019s instructions were later changed in part because of concerns it could result in retaliatory action against the United States.\n\nWhile the Trump administration left much of the heavy lifting to the states, other countries had a national strategy. The government of France alone has bought 2 billion face masks, including 400 million N95s.\n\nIn an interview, Kieke Okma, a former Dutch health official, said that because of their centralized medical systems, European countries, including her own, already have systems in place to buy and distribute medical equipment in bulk for hospitals.\n\nIn Canada, government and private sector officials said this week that their own shortage of N95 masks had largely been resolved, at least for now.\n\nThe short-term effort was led in part by Canadian diplomats and consultants in Beijing and Shanghai who developed connections to manufacturers. The Canadians then leased warehouse facilities in China to be sure that the acquired masks were secure before they passed through customs on their way to Canada.\n\nIn Ottawa, Trudeau\u2019s government asked the country\u2019s two major airlines to set up an air bridge bringing supplies quickly into the country. Once the masks arrived, federal officials worked with provincial leaders to distribute them where they were most urgently needed, Canadian officials said.\n\nThe country also fought gouging aggressively. As the pandemic spread, two provinces passed new laws against the practice, and others encouraged more aggressive enforcement of existing laws.\n\nCanada may also have benefited from relatively calm diplomatic relations with China as tensions were spiking with the United States.\n\nKirchhoff, who in 2016 wrote a White House paper on lessons learned from the Ebola epidemic, says the Trump administration missed an opportunity to alleviate the shortages with bold, early action.\n\n\u201cThis administration\u2019s response introduced chaos precisely because it did not mobilize the federal machinery it alone commands\u201a\u201d he said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1374,"url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2020\/05\/18\/coronavirus-bay-area-counties-to-universally-allow-storefront-retail-pickup-associated-businesses-to-reopen\/","publisher":"The Mercury News","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Fiona Kelliher', 'Robert Salonga', 'Maggie Angst']","title":"Coronavirus: All Bay Area counties to allow storefront retail pickup, associated businesses to reopen","image":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/SJM-L-PHASE2-0519-49.jpg?w=1024&h=683","body_text":"CLICK HERE if you\u2019re having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device.\n\nAfter sticking with some of the strictest stay-at-home orders in California to curb the spread of coronavirus, the entire Bay Area is advancing in lockstep through the second phase of reopening the state by allowing curbside retail pickup to start on Friday.\n\nThe new directive, signed Monday by six public health officials in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties and the city of Berkeley, replaces one issued just two weeks ago that permitted construction and other outdoor businesses and activities to resume.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 and the measures we\u2019ve taken to prevent the spread have profoundly disrupted the lives of every single member of our community,\u201d Santa Clara County Health Officer Sara Cody said during a news conference on Monday. \u201cHowever, our collective effort has significantly reduced the spread in our county, and we now have a little bit of headroom to cautiously take another step forward.\u201d\n\nThe new local order, which marks the second loosening of the region\u2019s mandate imposed in mid-March, falls largely in line with Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s guidelines for reopening the state. It places the region\u2019s 8 million residents firmly in the second of four phases in Newsom\u2019s plan, and all Bay Area counties on the same page, after San Mateo and San Francisco counties issued similar guidance last week.\n\nThe Bay Area\u2019s decision came within hours of Newsom\u2019s refining the criteria for counties to plunge deeper into phase 2 of reopening, such as no more than a 5% weekly increase in hospitalizations and a positive COVID-19 test rate of less than 8% countywide.\n\nGiven the current indicators, the governor said 53 of the state\u2019s 58 counties could start allowing a slew of business sectors to reopen, including in-store retail and hair salons, in several weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is an important period of time,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into an important few weeks ahead of us, and we\u2019re going to see a lot more activity. Let\u2019s just make sure we do it thoughtfully and strategically.\u201d\n\nSpectator-free sporting events could even resume by the first week of June, with some caveats. And, Newsom said, the state is \u201cwithin a few weeks of meaningful modifications\u201d involving places of religious worship.\n\n\u201cWe are working overtime with leaders in the community to come up with guidelines and restore that capacity,\u201d he said.\n\n[ FAQ: What does it mean to enter \u2018Phase 2\u2019? Which parts of the state qualify? ]\n\nIn the Bay Area, storefront and curbside retail pickup will be allowed to resume on Friday, along with the activities of associated manufacturing, logistics and warehousing businesses that support retail.\n\nUnder the regionwide order, stores are prohibited from moving their products outside for display or sale, and customers must order and pay for products online or over the phone. Businesses are permitted to operate only with one employee per 300 square feet unless the individuals are from the same household.\n\nThe new regulations only apply to retail stores with direct access to an adjacent sidewalk or outdoor pedestrian walkway, street or parking lot. Stores in an enclosed indoor shopping center or mall must remain closed.\n\nOutdoor museums, historical sites and publicly accessible gardens also are permitted to open their doors to visitors. And drive-through celebrations, parades and graduations are permitted across the region, as long as people ride solely in cars with members of their household and do not leave their vehicles. That new guidance comes less than two weeks after Santa Clara County explicitly banned car parades.\n\nDespite the governor\u2019s announcement Monday, different areas in the state are permitted to move at their own pace. In the Bay Area, where stricter regulations have been in place since the very beginning of the pandemic, in-person dining and shopping will have to wait, as well as other higher-risk businesses, such as gyms and bars, and any gatherings outside a person\u2019s immediate household.\n\nSanta Clara County, which once accounted for the most cases in the state, now has just 3% of the cases and 4% of the deaths statewide, according to Cody, and with more than double the number of tests conducted in the county since the middle of March, the rate of positive tests has declined from 9% to 1.5%.\n\n\u201cWe have flattened the curve here in Santa Clara County like nowhere else in the country, and its because of what everyone has done,\u201d Cody said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of picking off the menu that the state has offered as well as adding some additional local guardrails to keep our community safe,\u201d Cody said. \u201cWe understand the urgency, but we don\u2019t want to have to go backward.\u201d\n\nBut even as the Bay Area takes another modest step toward reopening its devastated economy, some business owners aren\u2019t celebrating just yet.\n\nOutdoor gear store Stevens Creek Surplus has remained open during the stay-at-home order for curbside pickup because of the construction- and restaurant-related products available in the store. But without allowing customers to come into the store, assistant manager Mustafa Makati said it has been difficult to adapt to the logistical challenges of restricting the foot traffic the store typically relies on.\n\n\u201cA lot of customers are not happy because they want to come in and browse,\u201d Makati said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s a lot of burden for two or three employees going back and forth, back and forth.\u201d\n\nAs of Monday, Santa Clara County had confirmed 2,470 cases of COVID-19, Alameda County 2,457, San Francisco 2,131, San Mateo County 1,671 and Contra Costa County 1,155.\n\nStaff writers Evan Webeck and Vytas Mazeika contributed reporting.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1377,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/national\/coronavirus-reopen-bathrooms\/2020\/05\/18\/a6ed57fc-93ba-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Marc Fisher']","title":"The need to go is a big barrier to going out.

In Florida, malls are installing touch-free sinks and hand dryers in restrooms before opening their doors. McDonald\u2019s is requiring franchisees to clean bathrooms every 30 minutes. Across the country, businesses are replacing blow dryers with paper towels, decommissioning urinals that now seem too close together, and removing restroom doors to create airport-style, no-touch entrances.\n\n\n\nIn San Luis Obispo, Calif., the Sunset Drive-In held back from reopening even though the health department gave it the green light because the owner needed time to figure out how to address customers\u2019 concerns about catching the novel coronavirus in the bathroom.\n\n\u201cBefore we open, we want to have the restroom problem solved for your safety,\u201d the owner, Larry Rodkey, wrote on Facebook. \u201cSitting through approximately five hours of movies is a necessity for the enjoyment of the Drive-In.\u201d\n\nThe theater reopened over the weekend with extra employees to disinfect the bathrooms every 30 minutes and limits on queuing up.\n\nThe Aut-O-Rama Twin Drive-In theater in North Ridgeville, Ohio, reopened this week with 10 portable toilets added to the eight existing stalls, even though movie attendance was limited to 25 percent of the usual capacity. On its marquee facing the highway, the theater touted the advantages of outdoor, in-car movie watching: \u201cSocial Distancing Since 1965.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOwner Deb Sherman has instituted new policies, leaving plenty of space between cars, requiring masks and enforcing six-foot distancing in the restrooms.\n\n\u201cAnyone not following established safe policies set forth may be asked to leave the theatre without a refund,\u201d the policy reads.\n\nShe doubled her staff from 10 to 20 to keep queues to a minimum and let customers see that someone was constantly disinfecting the restrooms and concessions stand.\n\n\u201cIf we can give them some confidence about safety, people are ready to get out of the house and try and have a little more normal life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe restroom situation didn\u2019t bother me personally, but it was the number one concern people had on our Facebook page, so I had to take action to make them comfortable.\u201d\n\n\n\nSuch comfort might be hard-won. Laura Maxwell is eager to find an entertainment option that would let her take her children, ages 11 and 13, out of the house safely. Maxwell, who lives in San Luis Obispo, would happily return to the Sunset Drive-In, but the prospect of restroom queues is bothersome.\n\n\n\n\u201cBathrooms are a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re huge contact places, and if you\u2019re shedding the virus, it\u2019ll be all over. Maybe they could just open up without bathrooms and people would know in advance and make the decision not to go, or to wear Depends.\u201d\n\nSolutions to people\u2019s anxieties might not be quite so simple, said Steven Soifer, president of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for safer and more private public bathrooms.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmericans have always had a fear of contamination from public restrooms,\u201d said Soifer, who also is a professor of social work at the University of Mississippi. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is part just heightened anxiety, but it\u2019s also part reality-based. Public restrooms in this country generally have open toilet seats \u2014 no lids \u2014 and high-pressure flushes create a plume of droplets that extends at least six feet.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus has been found in human waste up to a month after a victim has recovered. And a study published last week concluded that droplets from human speaking can hang in the air for at least eight minutes.\n\nSoifer\u2019s group seeks a retooling of public facilities that would place toilets inside fully enclosed unisex stalls, as is more common in Europe and parts of Asia. There would be larger dividers separating urinals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn our country, people aren\u2019t comfortable talking about bathroom issues in general,\u201d Soifer said. \u201cThe old frontier mentality and the emphasis on personal liberty has led to an attitude where there\u2019s no standard for public restrooms other than the building code. Now we need to extend social distancing to restrooms, and it\u2019s going to be very hard. Even if you limit the number of stalls, you then create a line of people outside.\u201d\n\nMakers of bathroom fixtures have seen a surge of restaurant owners and workplace managers ordering thorough renovations of their bathrooms \u2014 a level of attention unusual in a country where many public restrooms haven\u2019t moved much higher up the design ladder than the stereotypically awful gas station bathroom.\n\n\u201cPeople are converting to fixtures with touchless features,\u201d said Jon Dommisse, director of strategy for Bradley Corp., a Wisconsin-based maker of workplace washroom equipment. \u201cThey\u2019re swapping out faucets, dryers, anything with buttons, levers, knobs. They\u2019re reducing the number of people allowed in at a time, taking doors off and adding wash stations outside the bathroom to relieve crowding. Most of all, we\u2019re seeing a commitment to almost relentless levels of cleaning.\u201d\n\nBradley regularly conducts national surveys about bathrooms, and even in good times, 76 percent of Americans say they\u2019ve had memorably bad experiences in public restrooms. The latest survey, conducted last month, found that 91 percent of consumers want touchless fixtures in bathrooms, Dommisse said, \u201ca number we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing away: Push-button soap dispensers, and those high-velocity hand dryers that can blow germs across an entire room. Coming to a restroom near you: More copper fixtures \u2014 copper has antimicrobial properties \u2014 and dryers integrated into the sink so no one walks across the room dripping water.\n\n\u201cMaybe the multi-stall restroom is obsolete,\u201d said Michelle Kempen, an interior designer at Kahler Slater, an architecture firm in Milwaukee. \u201cWith covid, we\u2019re moving toward a more European model, where the WC is a single room and then you go out into a shared sink area, along with touchless design and maybe a return to restroom attendants.\u201d\n\nHaving an employee present at all times, she said, makes cleaning ongoing and evident.\n\nBut employees cost money, and the bill for retooling a restroom can be $25,000 or more \u2014 McDonald\u2019s is leaving it to franchise owners to foot the bill for $718 touchless sinks and $310 sensor-activated towel dispensers. Quick fixes are likely to be cheaper, such as a return to paper towels, additional signage and one-way foot traffic.\n\nSome businesses now want cleaning done by day rather than when they\u2019re closed so customers and employees can see the company taking cleaning seriously, said Michelle Goret, a spokeswoman for Cintas, an Ohio-based supplier of restroom services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo further ease consumer anxiety around restrooms, our customers are also more interested in providing proof of service,\u201d Goret said. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had some customers film our technicians performing a deep clean to share with their customers and employees.\u201d\n\nFiguring out what might restore consumer confidence is more art than science. In a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll this month, 78 percent said they would be uncomfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant. The results were similar whether people lived in a state that is opening up businesses or one still operating under tight restrictions.\n\nIn South Florida, where many stores are reopening, the Bal Harbour Shops mall hired 14 extra people to clean. Restaurants will move their seating outdoors, but customers still need to go inside to use the restrooms, which are being renovated to include automatic doors, touchless sinks and dryers.\n\nIn Milwaukee, at Good City Brewing\u2019s two locations, owner David Dupee plans to \u201ccontrol the number of people and mark off space where people should stand while they\u2019re waiting for the restroom \u2014 whatever we can do to make people feel comfortable that guests around them will be appropriately distant. But we don\u2019t expect any return to normalcy until there\u2019s a vaccine. We\u2019ve all been trained in recent weeks to walk across the street when we see other people on the sidewalk. That\u2019s just in our psyche now.\u201d\n\nOutdoor venues might seem to be the easiest to reopen, but whether they are sports stadiums, concert facilities or parks, visitors still eventually need to go \u2014 a packed event and beer and soda sales inevitably lead to crowded bathrooms and long lines \u2014 so managers of such spaces are focusing on how to provide relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Hiking Society has recommended that people limit their walks to places in their neighborhoods, in part to avoid having to stop to answer nature\u2019s call. Bathrooms at many parks and beaches are closed, and those that are open struggle with staffing and with maintaining a supply of toilet paper, which remains difficult to find in many places.\n\nSome mayors have even talked about hiring guards to assure that toilet paper doesn\u2019t walk off the premises.\n\nAll beach restrooms remain closed in Emerald Isle, N.C., but the Outer Banks town is taking bids from private services to clean bathrooms every 90 minutes and disinfect them every night once they reopen, probably in late May.\n\nTown Manager Matt Zapp said the added measures will cost $250 per cleaning for each of the three public restrooms, as well as the town\u2019s fire, police and EMS stations.\n\n\n\nAlthough beach crowds so far have been \u201csubstantially less than normal,\u201d Zapp said, \u201cpublic demand to return to \u2018life as we knew it\u2019 is increasing weekly.\u201d\n\nThe closing of many public facilities already has posed a considerable hardship to essential workers such as delivery drivers and police and to homeless people, who say the lack of access to toilets in stores, restaurants and even fire stations has made it difficult to get through the day.\n\nTruckers and food delivery drivers have filled social media with accounts of their fruitless search for open restrooms at their usual stops. Some restaurants now limiting their business to takeout service are barring delivery drivers from their bathrooms, erecting walls of tables and chairs to keep people out.\n\nSome cities have put portable toilets on streets to serve homeless people who previously depended on restrooms in public libraries, community centers and fast-food restaurants.\n\nSeattle opened six hand-washing stations and 14 portable toilets near homeless encampments, and San Francisco is staffing public bathrooms at 49 locations where homeless people congregate.\n\nEven police officers are having trouble finding a place to go during their shifts. Coffee shops are closed, and fire stations formerly hospitable to other first responders are taking a newly cautious approach.\n\nIn Manchester, Maine, the fire station restroom was closed to the state and county cops who usually pop in. \u201cNo law enforcement,\u201d said the sign on the door.\n\n\u201cWe have a small, volunteer fire department, and it would be devastated if we lost a couple of guys who had to quarantine,\u201d said Robert Gasper, who is chairman of the town board of selectmen and a captain in the fire department. \u201cVolunteerism is down across the country, so we can\u2019t afford to take a chance.\u201d\n\nSuch uncertainty is likely to remain as people decide when to resume going out, and part of the calculus will be whether they can make it comfortably through a day.\n\n\u201cThe new normal is going to be traveling with your own toiletries,\u201d said Sonia Massey, who, with her husband, Bill, developed the Restroom Kit, a packet the size of a deck of cards that includes a toilet seat cover, three feet of toilet paper, and sanitary wipes. They also sell hand sanitizer in misters and gel bottles.\n\nThe Masseys, who live in Clinton, Md., have seen sales surge for their five-year-old product \u2014 a sign, they say, that people who feel they\u2019ve lost control are eager to take charge of at least life\u2019s most intimate aspects.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1384,"url":"https:\/\/issuesinsights.com\/2020\/05\/19\/america-is-reopening-itself-will-politicians-be-able-to-stop-it\/","publisher":"Heartland Institute","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":[],"title":"America Is Reopening Itself: Will Politicians Be Able To Stop It?","image":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/issuesinsights.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Whiskey_Insurrection-1-e1589826293283.jpeg?fit=730%2C290&ssl=1","body_text":"I&I Editorial\n\nWeary of more than two months of lockdowns, lost jobs, vanished income, and emotional distress, Americans are practicing a bit of Irish Democracy, shopping, dining out, gathering, and trying to carry on as before the pandemic arrived without approval from authorities. It was bound to happen.\n\nAs has been widely noted, we were initially told that we needed to shut down and shelter in place so that we would \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infection growth to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed by people sick with COVID-19. That benchmark was met a little more than a month into the lockdowns. Time magazine reported in late April that \u201cThe U.S. Has Flattened the Curve.\u201d This New York Times chart clearly shows that the flattening began early last month.\n\nYet many Americans are still under shelter-in-place orders, some of which have been extended. We hate to use a cliche, but politicians have been moving the goalposts. Flattening the curve isn\u2019t good enough. They want to keep people home until there\u2019s a vaccine; or science, which has sadly become a loose term that means whatever the user wants it to, has established an effective treatment; or maybe until there are zero coronavirus cases.\n\nThis has rankled more than a few. The masses are fed up with huddling in their homes and are yearning to breathe free.\n\nThe center of the \u201cresistance\u201d might be, oddly enough, in California, which has three \u201cFree Counties.\u201d Sutter and Yuba, just north of Sacramento, and Modoc, in the state\u2019s far northeast corner, have reopened without Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s approval. More counties quickly followed, rushing, reports the Sacramento Bee, \u201cto persuade state health officials they are ready to reopen key segments of their local economies on a fast-track basis.\u201d\n\nIn Southern California, Orange County engaged Newsom in a bitter battle over reopening beaches there. Newsom closed the shoreline when he saw photos that he didn\u2019t like of people on the sand in Newport Beach. County Supervisor Michelle Steel called it an \u201cact of retribution against Orange County.\u201d But beachgoers eventually won by kicking up such a fuss that Newsom and state authorities were pressured into making a decision they otherwise would not have made.\n\nMeanwhile, Michiganders are chafing under the boot of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has issued arguably the harshest lockdown orders in the country, and has even extended to May 28 her initial closure order for some businesses. The capital in Lansing has been the site of demonstrations by some deeply restless, and in many cases angry, protesters.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any bloodshed yet,\u201d one member of a Facebook group called Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine recently wrote.\n\nWe hope there is none. But tempers are short. One man has already been charged with making death threats against Whitmer and the state attorney general. And we\u2019ve seen members of the Michigan Militia swear they aren\u2019t going to allow law enforcement to arrest an Owosso barber who reopened his business because he had no other income. How long can she hold back demands for freedom \u2014 in America?\n\nOther developments include:\n\nPalm Beach County, Florida, reopened before it had met federal guidelines, according to a weekend story in the Florida Sun-Sentinel.\n\n\u201cLockdown-weary New Yorkers ditched the distancing to get social instead this weekend \u2014 transforming parts of the Big Apple into a raucous, late-season Mardi Gras,\u201d the New York Post reported last week.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 orders, immediately lifting \u201call restrictions on businesses and gatherings imposed by the administration\u2019s order\u201d while keeping \u201cin place the closure of schools until fall.\u201d The suit was filed by the Republican leadership in the Wisconsin Legislature.\n\nA group has filed a lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the attorney general for using the \u201cpandemic as an excuse to revoke a long list of natural rights\u201d guaranteed by the Constitution, and \u201crecognized in the Declaration of Independence.\u201d\n\nStephen Kruiser, who writes PJMedia\u2019s Morning Briefing, suggested Monday that the lockdown governors need to be locked up. \u201cThe \u2018never let a crisis go to waste\u2019 crowd continues to overplay its hand, which is why this would be the perfect time to begin some real push-back against them,\u201d he writes. They \u201cneed to be reined in for the financial well-being of the people whose lives they\u2019re ruining.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers showed up Monday at a New Jersey gym that opened without permission. One of the officers read a notice informing the members they were in violation of the governor\u2019s orders. He then said \u201con that note, have a good day. Everybody be safe,\u201d before turning and walking away.\n\nA few days after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that counties and businesses that plan to reopen without state approval were committing a \u201ccowardly act,\u201d protesters rallied on the capitol steps in Harrisburg, chanting \u201copen us up\u201d and \u201clet us work.\u201d\n\nOther protests have been seen on Long Island, and in Sacramento; Annapolis; Washington, D.C.; North Carolina, Rhode Island, Ohio, Minnesota, and Livermore, California.\n\nThe control that politicians and unelected bureaucrats who are advising them have been exerting is clearly slipping away, and they are facing a choice: They can work with the people who feel suffocated and expeditiously restore as much normalcy as possible, or they can remain on their present course, which increases the chances there\u2019ll be violence because either a protester or someone in a security line will make a poor decision of out anger or fear, and then pay the price on Election Day.\n\nAs Adm. Josh Painter said in \u201cThe Hunt For Red October,\u201d \u201cthis business will get out of control. It will get out of control and we\u2019ll be lucky to live through it.\u201d There is that much raw emotion out there.\n\n\u2014 Written by J.

The plan shuts down all \u201cnonessential\u201d activities, lays off workers and expands government benefits and control of society. These massive one-size-fits-all programs deliver predictably inhuman and inflexible results, typical of communist governments.\n\nThe problem is that the coronavirus crisis is a human problem. Human problems demand human solutions. Treating human problems in a global, mechanized way treats people like mass-produced goods. It destroys those organic solutions that arise when people employ the original and proportional means that are part of their human nature. Governments need to work with nature, not against it. The Chinese model is an example of how not to deal with a crisis.\n\nThe German Model of Lockdown\n\nConsider the German model of industrial lockdown. Germany faced the coronavirus crisis, just like all other Western nations. However, it did not shut down its economy. It did not create mass unemployment or lead vast numbers of companies to bankruptcy. The country employed commonsense measures to deal with the crisis that paid off. Today, Germany has one of the world\u2019s lowest fatality rates and survived the lockdown with its industrial base intact.\n\nGermany is an example of how organic solutions can address a massive crisis. It contrasts with the inflexible Chinese communist model that has devastated many Western economic systems.\n\nGermany is blessed with an industrial base that is different from most developed countries. It relies on a network of medium-sized family-owned businesses called the Mittelstand that serve specialized niche markets to keep its competitive edge. Such companies are very nimble when facing problems. Their manner of acting is more personal. Even huge companies, however, profit from this business culture.\n\nGermany followed three organic principles that saved its industry from devastation.\n\nUsing Subsidiarity\n\nFirst, the German government gave a certain amount of freedom to the business owners. It followed the principle of subsidiarity by which decisions are made at the lowest possible level. Higher levels of authority only intervene when the lower orders are unable to cope with problems.\n\nIn the case of the crisis, the government gave business owners the option of staying open. Closure was not mandated across the board, but it was a human decision decided on a personal level. There was also no division into essential and nonessential businesses. All were considered essential and vital as they should be.\n\nThe companies had to follow certain guidelines, but how they were implemented was left to them. Thus, more than 80 percent of companies stayed open. Many of them weathered the coronavirus crisis producing at high capacity. Lack of supplies from other countries, not sickness, often slowed production.\n\nHuman Decisions\n\nAbove all, those running the factories were allowed to implement the safety measures they needed to safeguard their workers. The idea behind the decision is that the owners are the best judges of the local situations. They are also the ones who will be held accountable and therefore assume responsibility.\n\nMoreover, German companies took the initiative to enact measures much earlier than the government. They saw the deteriorating situation in China and quickly took action. Managers worked together with workers to improve safety planning.\n\nFlexible Solutions in a Fast-Changing Environment\n\nThe final organic principle involves the appearance of spontaneous and original solutions to the problems caused by the crisis. Workers were challenged to come up with ideas to make the workplace safe and productive. Managers found that staggering work shifts reduced risks to exposure.\n\nThus, companies would do their own testing well before the government organized its programs. Some firms would manufacture their own sanitizers and distribute them to workers and communities. Daily meetings by managers and workers yielded an explosive harvest of good ideas that government guidelines could never achieve. Workers felt safe in their factories because they had helped make them safe.\n\nThe ability to turn on a dime kept German companies online, while Chinese communist models put \u201cnonessential\u201d companies out of action so that they could not be part of the solution.\n\nImpressive Results\n\nThe results of the German model for industrial lockdown are impressive. The Wall Street Journal reports that most German factories will not be facing the irreparable devastation other Western nations suffered. Germany also registered about one-quarter of the number of deaths from the virus as its Chinese model locked-down neighbors. The number of workers diagnosed with the coronavirus was minimal, and most return to work quickly.\n\nGermany will suffer from the worldwide downturn that will cut demand for products. A big part of its economy is geared toward exports and thus will also suffer. However, Germany did not experience the need for massive bailouts, unemployment programs and payroll protection schemes that America had.\n\nThe question remains. Why are most countries still clinging to the brutal Chinese lockdown model when more human and organic solutions, like the German experience, have proven so much more effective?","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1405,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/sports\/2020\/05\/19\/nascar-sticking-close-its-roots-might-be-smart-even-after-coronavirus-pandemic\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Barry Svrluga']","title":"For NASCAR, sticking close to its roots might be smart even after the coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/JZWGP7UYXYI6VLLZ5334242GIE.jpg&w=1440","body_text":"In the 70 years since it opened, there has never been another top-of-the-sport track that mirrored Darlington Raceway, and therefore there aren\u2019t races elsewhere like there are at Darlington. No two turns are the same. The walls, they come up on you quick. The car can win at some tracks. The driver must win at \u201cThe Track Too Tough to Tame.\u201d\n\nYet Darlington, like so much about NASCAR\u2019s unique and colorful roots, has been disrespected and disregarded by its top decision-makers \u2014 until those decision-makers needed old standbys to come through. The original 2020 NASCAR schedule had one race in the elite Cup Series at \u201cThe Lady in Black,\u201d which is one more than at the similarly historic tracks abandoned years ago in North Wilkesboro and Rockingham, N.C.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhere along the road to becoming a chic mainstream sport, NASCAR lost its soul. Maybe a pandemic could help NASCAR rediscover it.\n\nNASCAR became the first major U.S. sport to hold a regular season, this-really-counts event in two months when it staged a 400-mile race at Darlington on Sunday. It\u2019ll follow with another Darlington race Wednesday night, doubling the number of Cup races the track was scheduled to host this year in a matter of four days.\n\nStudy the revised and still-evolving schedule \u2014 altered, of course, by the novel coronavirus pandemic that has changed every aspect of our lives \u2014 and note the tracks that are hosting seven Cup races between now and June 10: Darlington, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Martinsville Speedway. That right there is the heart of NASCAR\u2019s old footprint. That right there is where any post-pandemic schedule should be based.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend I follow the inner workings of NASCAR on a week-by-week \u2014 or, at this point, even a season-by-season \u2014 basis. But for most of two seasons, I covered this traveling circus for the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C. They weren\u2019t just any two seasons, either. They were 1999 and 2000, right when NASCAR was rocketing into widespread mainstream popularity, right when it was spreading to markets in every region of the nation, right when NBC and Fox combined to grant it a massive national television contract, right when it was losing its way before it could realize what was happening.\n\nThe rejiggered NASCAR schedule for this season is designed completely around the pandemic. These first seven Cup races are within easy driving distance of the headquarters for the vast majority of race teams, which is the Concord, N.C., area, just north of Charlotte. The idea is to limit competition to one day \u2014 no qualifying, no practice, just racin\u2019 \u2014 and eliminate air travel and hotel stays.\n\nIn photos: NASCAR fires back up with nobody in the stands share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image May 17, 2020 | Kevin Harvick, driver of the #4 Busch Light YOURFACEHERE Ford, celebrates winning the NASCAR Cup Series The Real Heroes 400 at Darlington Raceway. (Jared C. Tilton\/Getty Images)\n\nThere\u2019s an opportunity within: What if, in the aftermath of all this, we relearn that \u2014 at least from a sports perspective \u2014 geography and the culture associated with it matter?\n\n\n\n\n\nNASCAR originally grew from the rural South, where clever and resourceful mechanics souped up cars for bootleggers so they could outrun the law in dry counties. There was a creative rebelliousness about it all, and the cunning that went into speeding away from Smokey to deliver moonshine ended up in the NASCAR garage, where real American ingenuity took the shape of bent \u2014 and outright broken \u2014 rules, all in the name of making a car go fast. How original. How fun.\n\nJust before the turn of this century, more people started to sense that originality and that fun. NASCAR pounced. What once was a regional sport with its headquarters in Daytona Beach, Fla., and its heart in the Carolinas expanded \u2014 quickly \u2014 into a national brand. The advertisers in New York wanted a piece and, in turn, NASCAR wanted a piece of Hollywood. New offices developed in Manhattan and Los Angeles. New sponsors elbowed each other out of the way. Disney made \u201cCars.\u201d Will Ferrell made \u201cTalladega Nights.\u201d NASCAR knew no bounds.\n\nWith more demand came more supply, and the race calendar bulged. New markets percolated from coast to coast. There was money! There was attention! There was growth! In 1993, what was then known as the Winston Cup Series held 20 points races in seven southeastern states and 10 more spread among seven states, with just two races west of the Mississippi. NASCAR knew where its biscuits were buttered.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2005, by which time the top series had been renamed the Nextel Cup, regional loyalty and identity had been abandoned. A bursting-at-the-seams 36-race schedule featured 16 points races in those seven southeastern states \u2014 Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina \u2014 and the remaining 20 spread across a dozen states, with nine races west of the Mississippi.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just the new markets that seemed like a cash grab. It was the construction of new tracks, so many of them nearly identical \u201ctri-ovals\u201d that served to maximize more expensive seating on long frontstretches, with the requisite corporate and sponsor boxes above the masses. No minnow pond would ever get in the way again.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear now was only predictable by pessimists back when I covered NASCAR: It ended up with a watered-down product on boring tracks spread across the country in front of fan bases that didn\u2019t care as much, if they cared at all. By 2018, television ratings hit an all-time low. NASCAR stopped announcing in-person attendance. Many tracks removed grandstands. In pursuing new fans, NASCAR alienated its base.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe the restructuring forced by the pandemic could win it back.\n\nThere\u2019s really no way to tell what any specific sport will look like assuming we get to the other side of all this, but it just seems foolish to assume it\u2019ll be precisely as it was when 2020 dawned. In a sense, the pandemic should force leagues to consider not only what\u2019s best for the rest of this year but how they might improve well beyond.\n\nAfter Wednesday night, the next two races on the Cup schedule are at Charlotte, which might not be the most interesting layout but at least is at the sport\u2019s geographic epicenter and cultural core. Beyond, there\u2019s the variety of the short tracks of Bristol and Martinsville. In late June comes the monstrous superspeedway in Talladega, Ala., as fast as the sport can go. Embrace it.\n\n\n\nWhy not grow by shrinking? Race at Richmond and Atlanta, Daytona and Bristol, even Darlington again. Even without fans in the stands, pander to the base in hopes of recapturing it again, especially when there are precious few sporting alternatives to focus on.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1415,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/travel\/2020\/05\/19\/atlantic-beach-towns-brace-tourists-amid-coronavirus-reopenings\/5190602002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Chris Woodyard', 'Jeff Schwaner']","title":"Atlantic beach towns brace for summer vacationers \u2013 but know it won't be the same","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/10\/USAT\/bb615c38-b920-4a2a-a99f-fd58464e5609-GTY_1212466182.JPG?crop=5529,3110,x0,y42&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"After a stressful year, Terri Senter couldn't bemore ready for a beach vacation. But the coronavirus has thwarted her plans at every turn.\n\nSenter and her husband, Gene, booked a trip from home in Indianapolis to Daytona Beach, Florida, for early May. When the chances of the city reopening by that pointseemed remote, she rebooked for June 15, assuming the pandemic would have played out by then. Now with that date a few weeks away, she figures there's still a heightened chance of contracting COVID-19. That's a risk she's unwilling to take as caregiver to her 90-year-old mother.\n\n\"I keep trying to tell myself so many people have it way worse off than we do,\" said Senter, who worries she may lose the $1,000 in reservations she has plunked down already. \"But that doesn't discount my feelings. I am disappointed.\"\n\nOther families are facing the same tough decisions about their vacations this year.\n\nA visit to the Eastern shore is a rite of summer for many. From Maine to Florida, Atlantic beach towns attract visitors ready to frolic in the waves, savor fries or frozen custard on the boardwalk or simply soak up rays under a beach umbrella.\n\nBut this year, fears of the coronavirus are throwing plans by the wayside. Those who considered the annual trek to East Coast beaches as fundamental as visiting family at Thanksgiving are being forced to reconsider.\n\nThe fears go beyond simply a higher risk of catching the virus. Inconsistent policies by states and communities are making it hard to plan as local officials decide how to best try to salvage economies while emerging from strict stay-at-home orders.\n\nPolicies vary widely in some states, a hodgepodge of rules from one beach town to the next. In others, the states have rules in place that impede summer visitors.\n\nIn Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Scarborough and East Matunuck beaches would be the first to welcome beachgoers. But there will be restrictions. The number of parking spaces will be significantly reduced, bathrooms and concession stands will be closed, and there will be no lifeguards.\n\nIn Middletown, Rhode Island, the town administrator said details on how to handle summer beach visitors were still being worked out. \"Each beach is different, and the town council needs to decide what's best for Middletown,\" Shawn Brown said in an email.\n\nTourism-related businesses have been stymied by a policy of requiring out-of-staters to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s the first week of June that the quarantine is lifted, but by July 1 at the latest,\u201d said Walter Andrews, general manager of the Newport Marriott, the largest hotel in Newport, Rhode Island. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial we have a date. I can\u2019t make a move without direction from the state.\u201d\n\nNew York state beaches will reopen the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. In announcing the reopening, the state joins New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut.\n\nBut expect to find new rules at any beach. Those flocking to Cocoa Beach, Florida, must not gather in groups of more than five and must stay at least 6 feet from other groups. Violators face potential $500 fines. Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina has limited groups to 10 and doesn't allow sunbathing or just sitting \u2013 only \"non-stationary exercise activities\" like walking, jogging, swimming and surfing\/water sports.\n\nAs summer nears, the restrictions could ease and the crowds will follow, beach town locals predict.\n\n\"People are tired of being cooped up in the house, and once the governor gives that OK, it's going to get crowded again,\" said Devon Byrd, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nBut if COVID-19 cases start to increase, the rules \u2013 and perhaps new ones \u2013 could be reimposed. Against that backdrop of uncertainty, families are having to lay bets about whether try to attempt their usual vacations.\n\nMore:Palm Beach County, Fla. restaurants reopen amid outbreak\n\nScott Kessler of Stuarts Draft, Virginia, and his family typically visit Virginia Beach several times a year. They stay at the Best Western Sandcastle on 13th Street. They always eat at Captain George\u2019s Seafood Restaurant. They schedule their trips for August or September so they can attend an Old Dominion University football game.\n\nThis year, the plan was to go Sept. 4 to watch Old Dominion University play Wake Forest University, and then make a weekend of it by getting in some beach time. Facing COVID-19, Kessler is uncertain if that will happen.\n\n\u201cWe're likely going to wait to see what happens to the virus before we make any concrete plans,\u201d Kessler said.\n\nHe\u2019s hoping conditions are better later in the summer. Even if he can go, he knows it won't be the same.\n\nKessler said they probably won\u2019t eat at Captain George\u2019s. They\u2019ll still likely take a swim in the ocean, but do so while practicing social distancing.\n\nGoing to a crowded football game is a concern, but if the family goes, Kessler said they\u2019ll wear face masks.\n\nAmie Michael of Mount Sidney, Virginia, usually goes with her family to Virginia Beach shortly after school is out for the year. She\u2019s a teacher and with one child still in high school and another in college, it\u2019s an end-of-school-year celebration. They're waiting to see what happens.\n\n\u201cIt has been booked for months,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are still hoping to go but will cancel if the beach doesn't open.\u201d\n\nMore:Iconic beaches reopen along Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nIf they do go, dining and activities around towns could be challenges. Even though popular Rehoboth Beach in Delaware's boardwalk and beach have reopened, bars and restaurants are still takeout only. Short-term rentals and hotels are also not yet back.\n\nMerchants, whose fortunes depend on strong summer business, are hoping for the best. They know this will be a summer like no other \u2013 both in terms of how many customers to expect and the precautions they will need to take to keep them safe.\n\n\"I think it could be a healthy mix of apprehension and excitement,\" said Karen Sphar, executive vice president of the Southport Oak Island Area Chamber of Commerce in North Carolina. \"If you are a business owner, you are extremely excited and ready to go. You may have been limping along a little bit, but now you are looking forward to getting business back into your establishment.\"\n\nVacationers may want to isolate themselves in beach shacks or seaside apartments that they can treat as their own homes with less worry about the coronavirus left behind by past guests. They will be encouraged to shun crowds.\n\n\"People want to get away and have a safe vacation,\" said Isaac Baker, marketing director for Treasure Realty in Topsail Beach, North Carolina. \"There's no better place to be than in the sunshine on the beach.\"\n\nContributing: Laura Damon, Hunter Ingram, Adam Van Brimmer, Jannette Pippin, Patrick Hite, Laura Peters, Leanna Smith, Katie Nussbaum, Rick Neale, Karen Croke, Rebecca King, Eric Williams, Danny LoGiudice","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1416,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2020\/05\/19\/coronavirus-update-us\/#link-2LEFGWW4FZAGZFPNHS3XNUKTB4","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Teo Armus', 'Antonia Noori Farzan']","title":"Live updates: All 50 U.S. states have taken steps toward reopening in time for Memorial Day weekend","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/UOD7XAUZRII6VLLZ5334242GIE.jpg&w=1440","body_text":"DUBAI \u2014 Qatar announced new restrictions on residents, including the mandatory download of a tracking app and the closure of all nonessential stores for the next 10 days, as new infections soar across the region during Ramadan.\n\nSeveral other Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, have imposed new restrictions recently as cases have increased dramatically following the easing of constraints during the holy month.\n\nQatar\u2019s announcement followed a cabinet meeting Monday.

While the mid-March shutdown came after the Caribbean's high season, a full summer without the regular work that cruise ships bring in could have lasting economic consequences.\n\nAt the same time, most islands have limited health care facilities; an influx of coronavirus cases from tourists, both on land or sea, could prove devastating to residents. Discussions on the islands are centering on that paradox: how to bring back the tourists who fuel the economy without endangering the people who live there.\n\nCruiseCritic.com is checking in with major ports in the Caribbean to see how the conversations are going. Here's what the cruise website is hearing.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\nHome to St. Thomas, one of the Caribbean's busiest cruise ports, the U.S.V.I. have been under the same health restrictions and warnings as parts of the United States and have been following regulations set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTourists will be permitted to return to the islands June 1, but cruise ships won't come back until much later, as the lines work out their agreements with the CDC, Joseph Boschulte, Commissioner of Tourism for the territory, told Cruise Critic in an interview.\n\nThe mid-March timing of the cruise line shutdown came after most of the islands' high season, which runs from November through the end of March\/early April, had already occurred, Boschulte said. Still, the revenues stopped from mid-March on, leaving the island without the crucial spring break income and run up to the Easter holidays, he said.\n\n\"We have gone from a trajectory of having a little over 1.5 million cruise customers in the territory for this fiscal year \u2026 and then we went to zero,\" Boschulte said. Summer traditionally has been a softer season for the Caribbean, but St. Thomas still averages between 100,000 to 115,000 cruise visitors in May and June; those two months alone represent a loss of nearly $36 million.\n\nThe Virgin Islands government and tourism interests have been talking regularly to the cruise lines about their plans to return, both individually and through the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association. Discussions center around how lines not only can ensure that passengers stay safe from COVID-19 during port stops, but also how the island can protect its residents from getting ill, Boschulte said.\n\nTesting for the virus has become a cornerstone in requirements for lines returning, but questions remain as to who does it \u2013 and when \u2013 the minister said. \"What do we do after they come back from touring or on the beach \u2013 do we test them before they go back on board or does the ship?\"\n\nAny excursion that takes place in St. Thomas will have to follow local health and safety protocols, Boschulte said. \"Even when the bars and restaurants open, the expectation is that you will wear a mask,\" he said. Shore excursion operators and even the popular ferry to St. John could also require masks. \"The next layer of questions become, 'Do (passengers) have to bring their own, or will the shore excursion company provide it?\"\n\nBoschulte also notes the island will need time to prepare safely, to make sure that residents who interact with tourists have the equipment they need, such as masks and hand sanitizer. \"That's taxi people, that's people who work the security at the gates, that's people who work the beaches, the restaurants and the bars.\"\n\nAnother big unknown that will affect St. Thomas: What will capacity be on the first ships that arrive? St. Thomas is a port for some of the industry's largest ships, such as Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, which carries up to 6,000 passengers. \"Now if they only sail at 50% capacity, that's a much different model for us a port to manage,\" Boschulte said.\n\n\"Until we get a vaccine, I think we are going to have to err on the side of most caution,\" he said. \"What I can tell you is that we're cautiously optimistic that over the next few months, we will get closer to having adequate testing and a very thorough protocol safety set of initiatives for the cruise industry that we, as travelers, can have confidence in what's being put in place, and also that the residents of a highly traveled cruise ship destination feel comfortable that guests coming back in doesn't jeopardize the quality of their health.\"\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nA home port for Southern Caribbean cruises, Puerto Rico was expecting 108 cruise ships in San Juan between May and September 2020. While the island is still evaluating the exact loss in revenue, the impact is being felt by a diverse group of businesses, including retail shops, tour operators, transportation businesses, harbor bunkering services and local suppliers.\n\nThe process of safely welcoming visitors again has been a top concern; the island has 80,000 people employed in tourism, which makes up 6.5% of Puerto Rico's GDP, Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico, told Cruise Critic.\n\nHe noted that the island was the first U.S. destination to implement measures such as an island-wide curfew and thermographic cameras to take temperatures of travelers coming into Puerto Rico at the San Juan airport. Other measures include implementation of intensive screening, enhanced sanitation, quarantine zones, on-site medical personnel and additional disinfection of local facilities.\n\nExpect to see buffets, salad bars and self-service restaurants eliminated in tourism businesses, Dean said. Reusable menus will not be available. Lodging for pre- and post-cruise stays will have island-specific certification cards, and guests will receive a health and safety guide from each property.\n\nPuerto Rico is well poised as a destination that can return in the post-COVID-19 world, Dean said, pointing out the island's abundant outdoor attractions and beaches.\n\n\"The Puerto Rican community has hospitality in its DNA and will undoubtedly welcome visitors back with open arms and the warmth that it did following past adversity,\" he said.\n\nSt. Kitts\n\nWith fantastic beaches as well as UNESCO historical sites, St. Kitts has become an important and popular stop on Caribbean cruise itineraries, on both Eastern and Southern routes.\n\nThe island was projected to receive 45 cruise calls between May and September 2020, with 166,936 projected passengers. The loss of that income, based on cruise passenger spend alone, is more than $18 million, according to Racquel Brown, CEO of the St. Kitts Tourism Authority.\n\n\"We began to see an impact as early as February and March to our cruise sector, which makes up a significant portion of our tourism industry as a whole and contributes approximately $136 million in passenger spend alone to our economy per year,\" she told Cruise Critic. \"Add to that about another $7 million including passenger fees, fuel charges, taxes, navigation services and so on, so the scope of the economic impact becomes very clear.\"\n\nCruising has helped St. Kitts grow a bustling summer tourism season, with at least two ships a week. \"There are many of our nationals who depend on the cruise industry, and the impact has been felt greatly. It has affected our vendors, who depend on the industry for their daily living, our beach vendors, our water sports operators, our taxi and tour bus operators and our hotels. Business owners have had to reduce staff hours or lay off staff. This has been difficult, as they have grown over the years from St. Kitts' vibrant cruise industry and at present there is no demand to sustain the amount of business they have grown accustomed to transacting.\"\n\nThe island country, which includes sister Nevis \u2013 a port for small and luxury cruise ships \u2013 has been working with the FCCA and other Caribbean countries for a \"careful and phased\" reopening plan, she said.\n\n\"The ability to meet the established CDC guidelines will be our first step to the cruise sector resuming business,\" Brown said. \"As a destination, we will adhere to CDC guidelines and protocols for the cruise industry as well as the guidelines provided by our Ministry of Health,\" which follows World Health Organization protocol.\n\n\"Of course, we know that social distancing protocols will have to be observed, the use of hand sanitizers, the washing of hands and the use of personal protective equipment in order to ensure the safety of our guests and our citizens and residents.\"\n\nWhat makes the COVID-19 crisis different from the hurricanes that often disrupt Caribbean tourism is the sheer scope, she said. With hurricanes, governments have emergency plans in place, and tourists often visit as soon as they can to help support the destination, which gives the country some level of control.\n\n\"The entire cruise industry is closed, the borders are closed. We have never had a no-sail order that has restricted the entire cruise sector,\" she said.\n\nWhile some islands might take the pause to consider issues of overtourism, Brown said that St. Kitts built cruising gradually and sees its growth as controlled. \"The people of St. Kitts enjoy and appreciate the cruise industry and look forward to the time when we can safely welcome visitors to our shores again.\"\n\nMore from CruiseCritic.com","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1429,"url":"http:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-epidemiolo\/some-signs-children-may-not-transmit-covid-19-two-uk-epidemiologists-say-idUKKBN22V1JV","publisher":"Reuters","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Guy Faulconbridge']","title":"Some signs children may not transmit COVID-19, two UK epidemiologists say","image":"https:\/\/s3.reutersmedia.net\/resources\/r\/?m=02&d=20200519&t=2&i=1519148549&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG4I0X5","body_text":"FILE PHOTO: A man and children wearing protective face masks walk near a Chessington World of Adventures car park, which has been turned into a testing facility as the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues, Chessington, Britain, March 28, 2020.

The department store chain posted a 41 percent drop revenue for the quarter, offering a stark reminder of how the pandemic is boosting some retailers while hastening the demise of others.\n\n\n\nConsumer spending has dropped precipitously in the weeks since the pandemic took hold. U.S. retail sales fell a record 8.3 percent in March, then plunged 16.4 percent in April, according to Commerce Department data, as Americans stopped spending on clothing, furniture, housewares and other nonessentials.\n\n\n\nRetailers temporarily closed more than 260,000 stores because of the coronavirus outbreak, all but bringing business to a halt for many companies that rely on in-store shoppers to drive the bulk of their sales. Four major retailers \u2014 J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores and J.C. Penney \u2014 have filed for bankruptcy this month, and analysts say they expect others to follow as more companies run out of cash and the economy continues to sour.\n\nPier 1, which had filed for bankruptcy weeks before the shutdowns, announced Tuesday it would cease operations altogether. It had planned to closed 450 of its 936 stores and shed 40 percent of its workforce and find a buyer, but the pandemic ended those hopes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy: the bigger, stronger players are taking even more market share,\u201d said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at the rating agency Moody\u2019s. \u201cAnd the companies that were weak to begin with, they are only going to become weaker.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut spending on groceries has continued to climb. Walmart, the country\u2019s largest grocer, said profits rose 4 percent, to $3.99 billion, during the first quarter. Demand has been so brisk that Walmart has hired more than 235,000 workers since mid-March, according to chief executive Doug McMillon. All 5,355 of the company\u2019s U.S. stores have remained open during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cMore than ever, the news this quarter is our amazing associates,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey are rising to the challenge to serve our customers and our communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut worker advocacy groups say the company\u2019s gains have come at the risk of employees\u2019 health. At least 22 Walmart employees have died from covid-related complications since March, according to labor advocacy group United for Respect.\n\nWalmart said it is providing free masks and gloves to employees and has installed sneeze guards at its checkouts. It has also announced two rounds of bonuses \u2014 $150 for part-time workers, $300 for full-timers \u2014 who work through the pandemic. It said it spent nearly $900 million on employee bonuses and other covid-related costs.\n\n\n\nThe retail giant also announced Tuesday that it is discontinuing the e-commerce site Jet.com \u201cdue to the continued strength of the Walmart brand.\u201d Walmart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com in 2016 and continued to invest heavily in the site in hopes that it would help win over younger, more affluent, big-city shoppers from Amazon. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\n\nHome Depot, meanwhile, said sales at U.S. stores open at least one year rose nearly 8 percent. Profits fell nearly 12 percent to $2.25 billion, as the company spent more on wages and cleaning stores.\n\n\u201cAlthough the pandemic has shrouded the retail world in gloom, Home Depot\u2019s results are something of a bright spot,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThat was not the case at Kohl\u2019s, which was one of thousands of retailers that shut its stores and furloughed the majority of its workers in March. The department store chain posted $541 million quarterly loss, compared with a $62 million profit in the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cKohl\u2019s results show the extent of the damage the pandemic has caused to nonessential retailers,\u201d Saunders said. Though he said a number of factors worked in the company\u2019s favor, including its focus on fitness apparel and the location of its stores in strip centers instead of shopping malls, \u201cthe toll on the financial health of Kohl\u2019s should not be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a reasonably well positioned retailer like Kohl\u2019s is posting such bad numbers, it does not bode at all well for much weaker players in the market,\u201d he said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1443,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2020\/05\/19\/revisiting-one-many-debunked-efforts-minimize-scale-coronavirus-pandemic\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Philip Bump']","title":"Revisiting one of many debunked efforts to minimize the scale of the coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/73TMNHEIWAI6VAG72JFTLJLIVY.jpg&w=1440","body_text":"And then there was this, from earlier this month.\n\nWhat\u2019s the explanation here? \u201cNew CDC Coronavirus Data Cuts American Death Toll Nearly In HALF\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/CyyDpI8Fll \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) May 3, 2020\n\nAt this point, you can see the \u201cedit\u201d in the description of the linked article, an amendment added after the fact to acknowledge, to as small a degree as possible, that the premise of the article was entirely wrong. That was obvious in the moment, as The Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake made clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the article was insinuating was that the running total of covid-19 deaths compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was far smaller than what the media was reporting. At the time, the CDC listed about 37,000 deaths; media outlets were reporting something closer to 66,000. This was presented as the CDC having \u201ccut\u201d its estimate of the number of deaths from the virus \u2014 perhaps an acknowledgment that things weren\u2019t as bad as they seemed.\n\nBut, again, this was nonsense.\n\nEach day, the CDC publishes the number of deaths in a given week from covid-19. Many states and third-party aggregations of virus death tolls report the number of newly discovered deaths each day. If a hospital learns that a death the prior Thursday was a function of the virus, that death is included in the count for today, Tuesday. That\u2019s not how the CDC does it. Instead, the CDC uses official confirmation of deaths from death certificates and ascribes deaths to the days on which they occur, meaning that Thursday\u2019s death would be attributed to Thursday, even if we learned about it on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee where this is going? That means that last week\u2019s numbers will go up more this week \u2014 and that the CDC\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t offered in real time. Comparing its total with compiled state reports\u2019 total, in other words, is apples to oranges.\n\nNow, two weeks after Ingraham\u2019s elevation of this obviously wrong theory, we can show how wrong it was.\n\nThe article she linked to noted the disparity between the two lines below. The media was saying 66,000 deaths, but the CDC was under 40,000.\n\nThat total for the CDC used the department\u2019s May 1 estimate. It releases a new estimate every weekday and, in each subsequent estimate, the numbers for the deaths in preceding weeks have increased as new deaths were reported to the federal government. Put visually, here\u2019s how the CDC\u2019s weekly estimate of deaths has increased over time.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that most prior weeks were adjusted upward as new deaths were reported. You might recall a few weeks ago when we learned that there had been deaths in California even before the first confirmed death in the United States. Those deaths were added to the CDC\u2019s total for those weeks well after the fact.\n\nThe most recent estimate is from May 18. Here\u2019s how the weekly death toll now compares with the data from May 1. Notice in particular the data from April 25, the most recent week for which data were available on May 1. In the last 17 days, the CDC\u2019s estimated death toll that week has jumped by more than 8,000 cases \u2014 making up a big chunk of the \u201cmissing\u201d deaths Ingraham was so worried about.\n\nLooking at this cumulatively, you can see how the new estimate of total deaths compares with what was reported to the CDC on May 1. (The light-colored gray lines are the cumulative totals for each of the intervening estimates between May 1 and May 18.)\n\nNote the May 2 figure, the closest end-of-week date to the article Ingraham linked. The May 18 estimate suggests that nearly 62,000 people had died by that date \u2014 a bit lower than the 66,000 attributed to the media at the time.\n\nAgain \u2014 and meaning no disrespect to my colleague Aaron Blake \u2014 this was not hard to figure out at the time.

And unit development is a big part of that.\u201d\n\nIn the month of April, retail properties collected less rent than other real estate sectors, according to a Citi note on Friday after a week of real estate investment trusts\u2019 earnings reports.\n\nMalls collected only 28% of rents and shopping centers 60%, among other commercial property declines, Citi found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a time of opportunity for these firms to entrench themselves into where they want to be,\u201d said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe retail landscape is going to be open for redeployment and for expansion of the firms whose market share is growing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to have a location reshuffle based on the tenants that offer what people will want post-COVID,\u201d said Scott Crowe of the real estate investment firm CenterSquare Investment Management, including the ability to spend less time inside and lower prices.\n\nStarbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald\u2019s Corp (MCD.N) could also be among those that grow, said Neuberger Berman analyst Kevin McCarthy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a period of a few years where independents lose and chains gain\u201d as much as 10% to 15% of market share, McCarthy said of the restaurant industry. The winners of that share grab will be those models centered around convenience and accessibility.\n\n\u201cIt was a trend going 30 miles an hour, now accelerated to 100 miles an hour,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s corporate Darwinism on steroids.\u201d\n\nThere is precedent for fast-food expansion in the face of crisis. In 2010, Burger King was able to grow its brand in Western Europe at the tail end of the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThese were some of the best years we had\u2026 in Western Europe with many of our developing partners because there is tremendous opportunity,\u201d said Jose Cil, chief executive officer of Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, in a May 1 earnings call.\n\n\u201cOur business works in almost any environment,\u201d Cil told Reuters, adding that it is positioned to capture market share in Europe, Asia, the United States and Canada. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited and bullish long term.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the path to expansion could be choppy. Sales plunged in late March and April, leading many corporations to drop their financial forecasts and stop construction projects to save capital costs.\n\nEven if they wanted to keep building, permitting has been temporarily halted in many places.\n\nOccupancy restrictions will make reopening dining rooms tricky, and some restaurants may eventually change their floorplans to adapt to a new way of dining out.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nNonetheless, Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) CEO Randy Garutti said during a May 4 earnings call that \u201cas additional real estate and development opportunities become available, we\u2019ll be ready to capture the white space ahead.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s Co (WEN.O), Papa John\u2019s International Inc (PZZA.O) and Yum China Holdings Inc (YUMC.N) also discussed post-coronavirus expansion during recent Wall Street calls.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s opportunities that make sense for us on the real estate side, we will pursue those,\u201d said David Hoffmann, Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) chief executive officer in an April 30 earnings call. \u201cBut you also want to balance being a good corporate citizen and sticking to your values, and not being a shark either.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"UK","reliability":1},{"news_id":1460,"url":"http:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-asia-results-graphic\/coronavirus-leads-to-43-first-quarter-drop-in-asian-company-profits-idINKBN22V1G4?il=0","publisher":"Reuters","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Patturaja Murugaboopathy', 'Gaurav Dogra']","title":"Coronavirus leads to 43% first quarter drop in Asian company profits","image":"https:\/\/s4.reutersmedia.net\/resources\/r\/?m=02&d=20200519&t=2&i=1519145626&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG4I0V9","body_text":"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Profits at Asian companies have plunged by an average of 43% in the first quarter, the steepest decline in at least 9 years, with the oil and consumer sector hardest hit as the coronavirus pandemic kept people at home.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A CRH (China Railway High-speed) bullet train runs past Beijing's central business area, China December 13, 2017.

Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary,\u201d Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said.\n\nSocial distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry\u2019s main group IATA has said that airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, unless they drastically increased airfares.\n\nIn the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.\n\nWhile major U.S. airlines\u2019 middle seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings, and they have all slashed their flying schedules by as much as 90% in an effort to stem a cash bleed amid withering demand.\n\nStill, Bastian said on a quarterly investor call that fewer airplanes in the skies could be an \u201copportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience.\u201d\n\nIndustrywide, U.S. airline load factors have recently been about 33%, with some airlines reporting load factors in the 40% range as passenger traffic inches off historic lows. But it is still down about 90% over 2019 levels.\n\nAdding more flights could bring in more revenues but also costs. Delta, which does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years, has said it aims to halve its daily cash burn to $50 million in June.\n\nIn an effort to reassure passengers, U.S. airlines have also intensified cabin cleaning protocols, in many cases using electrostatic cleaning and fogging procedures. They have also endorsed temperature screenings by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), though this has yet to be implemented.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"UK","reliability":1},{"news_id":1476,"url":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-spain\/spain-lifts-ban-on-flights-from-italy-but-tourism-still-off-cards-idUSKBN22V13E?il=0","publisher":"Reuters","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Emma Pinedo', 'Inti Landauro']","title":"Spain lifts ban on flights from Italy, but tourism still off cards","image":"https:\/\/s2.reutersmedia.net\/resources\/r\/?m=02&d=20200519&t=2&i=1519148138&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG4I0WE","body_text":"A woman wearing a protective mask walks past a sculpture wearing traditional \"Chulapo\" attire and a mask as she leaves a lottery shop amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Madrid, Spain, May 19, 2020.

Officials in Brevard County, home to the Kennedy Space Center, are rolling out the welcome mat in an effort to jump-start a tourism industry hit hard this spring by coronavirus-related lockdowns.\n\nIn this Friday, July 8, 2011 file photo, crowds gather in the surf and on the beach in Cocoa Beach, Fla., to watch the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis on STS-135. It was the final U.S. shuttle mission before the fleet was retired. (Photo: Dave Martin, AP)\n\nIf people are comfortable coming and watching the launch, \u201cby all means, come. If they aren\u2019t, I respect that too,\u201d said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell Americans they can\u2019t watch a great piece of history. I\u2019m just not going to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sheriff said he is asking visitors to practice social distancing as they watch the launch of astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a test flight of SpaceX\u2019s Dragon crew capsule. Liftoff is set for 4:33 p.m. EDT.\n\nAround 85 reserve deputies will be on hand to monitor crowds and ask people to comply with social distancing if they are in groups. A local chain of beach shops is distributing 20,000 masks to spectators in coordination with the sheriff\u2019s office, Ivey said.\n\nThe sheriff, who grew up in Florida watching launches, wants a new generation to be able to experience the energy, excitement and feelings of patriotism that comes from watching a U.S. launch with astronauts.\n\n\u201cNASA is a true part of our history in Brevard County,\u201d Ivey said.\n\nEarlier this month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine asked potential spectators to watch the launch online or on TV from home. The space agency is also offering a \u201cvirtual launch experience.\u201d\n\nNASA is doing its best to facilitate social distancing inside the Kennedy Space Center by limiting access, although it may be hosting two VIPS. Vice President Mike Pence says he plans to be there, and President Donald Trump said he\u2019s thinking of attending.\n\nThe visitor center at Kennedy, usually a prime spot for viewing launches, is closed to the public.\n\nNASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. It will be the first attempt by a private company to fly astronauts to orbit for the space agency.\n\n\u201cThe challenge that we\u2019re up against right now is we want to keep everybody safe,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, and I will tell you that makes me sad to even say it. Boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular.\u201d.\n\nAlthough crowd sizes varied, a high-profile space shuttle launch could attract a half million visitors to the Space Coast. Local tourism officials think next week\u2019s launch will bring in no more than 200,000 spectators.\n\nWith airline passenger traffic drastically down and nearby Orlando theme parks closed because of the pandemic, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be getting the out-of-state traffic we may have gotten during the shuttle era,\u201d said Peter Cranis, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism.\n\n\u201cThe environment is different with COVID and people now reemerging from stay-at-home orders,\u201d Cranis said. \u201cThere are going to be a number of people who are hesitant.\u201d\n\nThe Space Coast\u2019s tourism business is down by about 40% for the year, and that could cost the area $1 billion, he said.\n\n\u201cA launch like this after a big long weekend could really give us a shot in the arm,\u201d Cranis said.\n\nLocal hoteliers are looking forward to the influx of visitors after two bad months. Tom Williamson, who is general manager of two hotels on the Space Coast, each with 150 rooms or more, said one hotel was closed and the other only had 15% occupancy in April. He expects both hotels to be at or near capacity on the night of the launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to seem some signs of life,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nIn this April 11, 1970 file photo, crowds watch the lift-off of the Saturn V rocket carrying the Apollo 13 spacecraft on its mission to the moon from Cape Kennedy, Fla.

For next week\u2019s SpaceX launch, he had booked around 150 people from as far away as Australia for $75 a head on a fleet of boats. He ended up scrapping those plans.\n\n\u201cIt would take too much logistical effort to see if everyone is wearing a mask, making sure no one has a fever, and how to you social distance on a boat?\u201d Giraldo said.\n\nInstead, he plans to watch the launch with seven other friends, some from Arizona and Indiana, in a boat on the Banana River.\n\n\u201cThis was going to be our biggest event. The historical significance of it created a lot of buzz,\u201d Giraldo said. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t know how we could have done it.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2020\/05\/22\/nasa-spacex-home-launch-florida-spectators-coronavirus\/111846786\/","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1486,"url":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-trump-who\/trump-threatens-to-halt-who-funding-review-u-s-membership-idUSKBN22V0B0","publisher":"Reuters","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":[],"title":"Trump threatens to halt WHO funding, review U.S. membership","image":"https:\/\/s3.reutersmedia.net\/resources\/r\/?m=02&d=20200519&t=2&i=1519107550&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG4I08J","body_text":"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Monday to permanently halt funding for the World Health Organization (WHO) if it did not commit to improvements within 30 days, and to reconsider his country\u2019s membership of the agency.\n\nTrump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO last month, accusing it of promoting Chinese \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the novel coronavirus outbreak, although WHO officials denied the accusation and China said it was transparent and open.\n\n\"If the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\" Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a letter posted bit.ly\/3bNB3R7 on Twitter.\n\nEarlier, Trump said the Geneva-based WHO had \u201cdone a very sad job\u201d in its handling of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, and he would make a decision on funding soon.\n\nTrump said in the letter the only way forward for the WHO was for it to demonstrate independence from China, adding that his administration had started discussing reform with Tedros.\n\nTrump also made various accusations against China in the letter including that it tried to block evidence the virus could be transmitted between people, pressed the WHO not to declare it an emergency, refused to share data and samples and denied access to its scientists and facilities.\n\nChina hit back on Tuesday with its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, saying the letter was slanderous.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leadership\u2019s open letter is filled with phrases of suggestions, maybes, and potentialities, and is trying to mislead the public through this specious method, to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao told a regular briefing.\n\nZhao said the U.S. decision to stop contributing to the WHO was a violation of its international obligations.\n\n\u2018REVIEW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\u2019\n\nA WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said on Tuesday the agency had no immediate comment on Trump\u2019s letter but expected to have \u201cmore clarity\u201d and a reaction to it later in the day.\n\nOn Monday, the WHO said an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible and it had received backing and a hefty pledge of funds from China.\n\nThe WHO, a U.N. specialized agency, is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and drugs to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nMore than 4.75 million people have been infected globally and 314,414 have died, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nThe United States contributed more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget.\n\nThis year, the United States has already paid the WHO about $58 million, senior Trump administration officials said last month, half of what it is required to pay for 2020 - known as an assessed contribution.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a meeting on \"opportunity zones\" in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., May 18, 2020.

(Photo: Kay Nietfeld, AP)\n\nFrance, whose president had pushed hard for the fund proposal announced Monday, exulted. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic breakthrough,\u201d said Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Tuesday. \u201cWe will be able to support the economic recovery in the countries most hit by the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second consequence is political: France and Germany affirm loud and clear their determination to see solidarity among European Union members placed at the heart of the European construction,\u201d he said, calling it \u201ca historical step for the whole European Union.\u201d\n\nMacron and Merkel suggested that the fund would send money starting in 2021 to the areas hardest hit by the virus outbreak and target sectors that are priorities for EU economic policy such as digitalization and fighting climate change.\n\nThe fund would be a one-off part of the EU\u2019s budget and take advantage of EU institutions\u2019 ability to borrow at extremely low interest rates for long periods. It adds to a 540 billion-euro package agreed among finance ministers from the 19 EU countries that use the euro. That included loans from the eurozone bailout fund that would have to be repaid.\n\nThe proposal remains a proposal, and key elements such as joint borrowing have been resisted by northern European countries such as Austria, Finland and the Netherlands. Until Monday, opponents also tended to include Germany, although Merkel had kept her comments vague on exactly how the recovery fund was to be funded.\n\nThe fund touches on broad issues of European integration and underlines the union\u2019s lack of a central financial authority like those that exist at the national level. Germany, which has run a string of budget surpluses in recent years, has long resisted anything that smacks of its taxpayers being on the hook for the spending in less fiscally solid countries such as Italy.\n\nThe EU countries already borrow together in a limited way through their development bank and bailout fund, but that money is for loans, not given as grants. The EU already spends money on economic development projects in member states through a budget that amounts to about 1% of GDP, leaving the vast bulk of government spending at the national level.\n\nIt is not clear how the northern European opposition would be reconciled, or how the French-German proposals would be incorporated into the recovery plan being developed by the European Union\u2019s executive Commission and due to be sketched out May 27. A commission spokesman said Thursday its proposal would include both grants and loans.\n\nNonetheless, as the two biggest countries in the EU, Germany and France are regarded as the chief political motor in the EU when they decide to work together.\n\nOpponents of shared debt remained subdued on Tuesday. Finland\u2019s finance ministry said it needed to study the proposal. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that \u201cour position remains unchanged,\u201d saying he had discussed the matter with Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nSince the proposal is for a one-time fund during a crisis, it would represent incremental change. But some were seeing it as potentially the harbinger of more EU central spending.\n\n\u201cCrucially, these funds would be passed on to member states as grants rather than loans and according to need, implying a fiscal transfer between countries,\u201d wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economic in an email. \u201cBut there is a lot of opposition to such a change, not least within Germany itself, so that is far from certain. And in the meantime, fiscal transfers will be small compared to the cost of the virus.\u201d\n\nReluctance by Germany and other countries to sharing the burden of the economic recovery from the pandemic - which was no European country\u2019s fault - provoked angry responses in heavily indebted Italy. Economists have expressed concern that Italy will come out of the crisis with even more debt and could face a financial crisis that would destabilize the wider region.\n\n\u201cWhether the recovery fund \u2013 if and when it is finally agreed \u2013 will help to dispel this impression and thus curtail the tail risk that a disaffected Italy may turn more euro-sceptic over time remains to be seen,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at private bank Berenberg. \u201cBut egged on by France, Germany is now taking the political risks sufficiently serious.\u2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/business\/2020\/05\/19\/germany-offers-share-debt-european-union-coronavirus-pandemic\/111803184\/","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1493,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/magazine\/2020\/05\/19\/donald-trump-pill-coronavirus-268786","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Michael Kruse']","title":"The Reason Donald Trump Will Take a Pill But Not Advice","image":"https:\/\/static.politico.com\/e3\/7c\/6bdb83494d879c8efb1e82f005b4\/200519-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg","body_text":"He has a knack for creating confusion and distraction when he needs to alter news cycles and scramble storylines. And he has a showman\u2019s instinct for grabbing attention. But what his surprising announcement reveals most clearly is his steadfast, decades-long aversion to expertise. Trump\u2019s deep-seated outsider mindset engendered a willful disregard for advice that often got him into trouble\u2014financial, reputational and otherwise. In the end, though, whether it was his ill-conceived airline, his debt-saddled casinos or his professional football misadventure, Trump\u2019s failure to heed warnings from even his most trusted advisers often served to enhance his celebrity with a sufficient portion of the public that doesn\u2019t take the time to parse the particulars.\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s the smartest guy on the planet,\u201d former Trump Shuttle president Bruce Nobles told me Tuesday. \u201cHe really does.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when he used the Sharpie on that hurricane map,\u201d said former Trump Organization executive vice president Barbara Res, referring to the episode last year in which Trump cartoonishly used a marker to alter a map of the path of a storm and then fought about it for a week rather than admit the smallest of mistakes.\n\nAnd now with hydroxychloroquine? \u201cHe\u2019s going to prove that he was right,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump political adviser, \u201cwhen everybody else said he was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllll about the base,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Rick Wilson told me in a text on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to tell those people, \u2018Of course I\u2019m taking hydroxy,\u2019\u201d former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci explained. \u201c\u2018They\u2019re telling you it doesn\u2019t work, but I\u2019m telling you it does.

He also, and even more disastrously, wanted to compete directly with the bigger, better, richer National Football League by playing games in the fall instead of the spring, and he didn\u2019t want to wait\u2014even after outside consultants penned a report recommending that the USFL stick with the spring slate, and slow, steady growth. Trump, however, convinced enough of his fellow owners it was \u201cbullshit.\u201d And the decision he drove to challenge the NFL in court did more than just tank. It killed the league for good.

More than 91,000 Americans have died from the virus.\n\n\u201cWhen we have a lot of cases, I don\u2019t look at that as a bad thing,\u201d the president said. \u201cI look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done.

It can devastate a range of organ systems, including the lungs, the kidneys and the cardiovascular system.\n\nBut for those who get very sick and are lucky enough to recover, the virus carries another potential danger \u2014 to mental health. Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 survivors could be at risk for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. As the number of infections continues to rise steadily, this potential hazard will also grow.\n\nWe have long known that being critically ill can lead to symptoms of PTSD, including chronic fear, arousal and avoidance. The reasons for this are complex. Having a life-threatening illness that requires intensive care can be terrifying. These patients are facing the possibility of their own death in a situation in which they have ceded control of their own bodies to strangers, often in painful or unpleasant ways. They often can\u2019t move, they are intubated, and they receive medications that make them feel sick or cause them to drift in and out of consciousness.\n\nThis nightmarish experience is often the everyday reality of being hospitalized with serious illness. These patients can also fall into a delirium and, after they recover, they are disturbed by vivid memories of these hallucinations and misperceptions.\n\nBrains primed to remember trauma\n\nIt also appears that being critically ill, particularly with severe infections that cause inflammation, can prime the brain to remember traumatic experiences. The brains of many of these patients are deluged with adrenaline, the fight-or-flight neurotransmitter. After all, what is more urgent than trying to stay alive? Adrenaline activates the amygdala, the fear center of the brain. When this happens, a person\u2019s memories tend to be strongly encoded. This is a key reason that people tend to remember so much about traumatic experiences.\n\nMany seriously ill patients can also experience a burst of inflammatory chemicals that triggers an additional adrenaline spike. On top of that, many of these patients suffer a dangerous drop in blood pressure, which is often treated with, you guessed it, a shot of adrenaline. As a result, many seriously ill people, including those with COVID-19, have very high levels of adrenaline, which likely affects how they experience the already distressing ordeal of being sick in the hospital.\n\nAs a psychiatrist who often sees survivors of critical illness, I am very familiar with these problems. In some ways, being seriously ill can resemble combat, another common cause of PTSD: In both cases, people feel extreme fear, intense arousal and a sense \u2014 often quite accurate \u2014 that they have little control over their own fate.\n\nGiven these circumstances, it makes sense that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be at risk for PTSD symptoms once they recover. The problem may be exacerbated because most hospitals are not allowing any visitors for these patients, so most of them must suffer alone, without family or friends.\n\nResearch suggests that PTSD symptoms are particularly common in people who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in which the lungs fill with fluid and breathing becomes difficult. Oxygen is central to life, and we have evolved to prize it intensely. Anyone who has gotten something caught in their throat knows how terrifying this feeling is. Now imagine that sensation lasting for days or weeks.\n\nIt cannot be ignored:During coronavirus isolation, treating mental health issues through telemedicine is vital\n\nOf course, ARDS is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Many such patients must be attached to ventilators in order to breathe. A tube is inserted deep into their throats, which can give them the sensation of being choked. Often, these patients must be sedated and restrained to keep them from pulling the tube out in a panic.\n\nThe problem may extend beyond the hospital. The health care system has been stretched so thin that many COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms don\u2019t go to the hospital at all. Some describe struggling over days to breathe freely. This group could also be at risk for persistent emotional effects.\n\nDon't overlook PTSD after COVID-19\n\nBecause COVID-19 is so new, there is little research on its mental health consequences. A study of over 700 COVID-19 patients by Chinese researchers, published in March in the journal Psychological Medicine, found that an astounding 96% of them had significant PTSD symptoms during quarantine. This rate is much higher than what researchers typically find for non-COVID critical illness survivors. Most researchers agree that 20% to 25% of such patients end up with PTSD symptoms.\n\nThe high rate found in the Chinese study could be due in part to the fact that these patients were quarantined for weeks in hospitals, apart from family and friends. The United States has not used this strict approach. Nevertheless, not all of these patients had a serious illness. In that region of China, anyone who tested positive for COVID-19, whatever their symptoms, was quarantined.\n\nA second crisis:Mental illness is epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic\n\nPTSD after critical illness is treatable, with strategies similar to those used for PTSD triggered by other circumstances. For many patients, a combination of medication and psychotherapy can, over time, ease or eliminate symptoms. But because the problem remains unfamiliar to many doctors, including most psychiatrists, many of these patients don\u2019t receive the help they need.\n\nIt is impossible to know how many Americans will ultimately be infected with COVID. But as the partial reopening continues, the number will likely stretch into the millions. Not all of these people will become seriously ill, of course, but many will. One recent paper from the Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that about 9% of patients infected with COVID-19 require intensive care. Of those, tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands could end up with symptoms of PTSD.\n\nOver the coming months and years, we will need to make sure that we focus on the mental health of these patients, providing the support they need to recover, not only physically but emotionally as well.\n\nDr. Joseph Bienvenu, a psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, studies mental health in survivors of critical illness.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1539,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/radio_by_any_means\/202005201079369188-us-targets-iran-venezuela-as-world-increasingly-skeptical-of-trump\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":"['Jacqueline Luqman', 'Sean Blackmon']","title":"US Targets Iran, Venezuela, as World Increasingly Skeptical of Trump","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107839\/90\/1078399048.jpg","body_text":"US Targets Iran, Venezuela, as World Increasingly Skeptical of Trump\n\nIn this episode of By Any Means Necessary hosts Sean Blackmon and Jacquie Luqman are joined by Ajamu Baraka, National Organizer for the Black Alliance for Peace, to talk about the news that all 50 states are reopening as the country passes 90,000 coronavirus deaths, the renewed waves of racist violence and harassment throughout the country, and his new article in Black Agenda Report, \"Neoliberalism, Intervention and Anti-Blackness.\"\n\nIn the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Dr. Seyed Mohammad Marandi, Professor of English Literature and Orientalism at the University of Tehran, to discuss Iran's warning to the United States not to interfere with their oil assistance to Venezuela, new US sanctions on a Chinese firm doing business with an Iranian airliner, and the themes of criminality and cruelty surrounding the ongoing economic warfare that comprises much of US foreign policy.\n\nIn the third segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Patricio Zamorano, academic, international media analyst, and co-Director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA.org), to talk about the wave of renewed protests by hungry workers in Chile, the parallels between Chile's handling of the crisis and those of other right-wing Latin American governments, and the rush by corporate media to demonize governments like Mexico and Nicaragua.\n\nLater in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Dr. Edward Onaci, Associate Professor of History and African American & Africana Studies at Ursinus College and author of the new book, \"Free the Land: The Republic of New Afrika and the Pursuit of a Black Nation-State,\" to talk about the new attempts by the Trump administration to crack down on mail-in voting, the news that commissioners in Franklin County, Ohio have declared racism a public health crisis, and how to incorporate theory and practice in a new and unpredictable world.\n\nWe'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1542,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/489242-khabib-father-abdulmanap-nurmagomedov-coronavirus-gadzhiev\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":[],"title":"'Why didn't they help him?'

We\u2019ve never been fully closed, we\u2019ll never be completely open until we have cure.\u201d Mayor Garcetti did not indicate when the cure might be forthcoming, but he was rather certain about the continued lockdown. Embattled residents of Los Angeles might wonder who is calling the shots during the pandemic.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Public Health Director is Dr. Barbara Ferrer, but local residents expecting a virologist, molecular biologist, or epidemiologist at the helm would be disappointed. Many were surprised to learn that, unlike her predecessor Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Dr. Ferrer is not even a medical doctor.\n\nFerrer earned a doctorate in \u201cSocial Welfare,\u201d which might draw a blank from someone with a PhD in physics, mathematics, or history. Ferrer earned her PhD at Brandeis, which is sketchy on the course of study for social welfare. On the other hand, graduate Freida Kapor Klein touts hidden bias, diversity and inclusion. University of North Carolina professor La Verne Reid, speaks of \u201chealth inequities,\u201d and Michael Levine, chief knowledge officer of the Sesame Workshop, hails \u201csocial justice policymaking.\u201d Still, there may be more to it.\n\nThe Social Welfare doctoral program at UC Berkeley, \u201cis designed to inspire independence and originality of thought in pursuit of knowledge.\u201d The social welfare program develops scholars \u201cwho make significant contributions to social work and social welfare teaching, research, policy development and analysis, and administration\u201d and \u201caddress a wide range of contemporary societal problems.\u201d Social welfare doctor Barbara Ferrer did not study at Berkeley, but before her master\u2019s in public health at Boston University, she earned a BA in \u201cCommunity Studies\u201d at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nCommunity studies, the university explains, dates from 1969 and was \u201ca pioneer in addressing principles of social justice, specifically inequities arising from race, class, and gender dynamics in society.\u201d Students in the program \u201cspend six months participating in and analyzing the work of a social justice organization,\u201d and graduates have been placed in \u201cfood justice organizations, immigrant rights centers, homeless resource and support groups, queer and transgender organizations,\u201d and other groups, \u201call pursuing a social justice mission.\u201d\n\nThat background got Ferrer hailed as a \u201cpublic health hero,\u201d who with her partners \u201cdeveloped a blueprint for eliminating racial and ethnic disparities which would immediately enact change, beginning with the way research data was collected and received about health and morbidity to represent racial, ethnic and language differences.\u201d That does not amount to medical science, but for Barbara Ferrer it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nWith her MPH and doctorate in social welfare, Ferrer duly became health commissioner for Boston, then the chief strategy officer for the W.K. Kellogg Foundation which \u201csupports children and families as they strengthen and create conditions that propel vulnerable children to achieve success as individuals and as contributors to the larger community and society.\u201d In 2017, Ferrer made the move west to Los Angeles County, home to 10 million residents, approximately the population of Sweden.\n\nSupervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas pronounced Ferrer \u201cuniquely qualified to lead and serve Los Angeles County\u2019s diverse populations,\u201d and the county granted her an annual salary of $376,635. Three years later Ferrer pulls down a cool $465,411, more than the official salary of the president of the United States. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded and Garcetti locked down Los Angeles, it emerged that Ferrer was not a medical doctor. When some questioned her qualifications, Ferrer pushed back.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough job for anybody to have to do,\u201d Ferrer told reporters. \u201cThe one thing I do want to note is I don\u2019t make decisions by myself. I have an amazing team of public health practitioners.\u201d As residents might have noted, it\u2019s not Los Angeles County that has the amazing team but Barbara Ferrer her own self. The unelected health boss clearly has a sense of her own power.\n\nLast week, after Dr. Anthony Fauci argued for keeping the lockdown in place, Ferrer announced that absent \u201cdramatic change to the virus\u201d the county would continue its shutdown for the next three months. Mayor Garcetti chimed in with \u201clonger than three months,\u201d followed by the proclamation that Los Angeles would \u201cnever be completely open,\u201d until we have a \u201ccure.\u201d That was the position of California Gov. Gavin Newsom who said on May 7 that California would not return to normal until a vaccine for COVID-19 was discovered. As many in California and across the country have noted, that marks a steep escalation from \u201cflattening the curve.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County public health boss Barbara Ferrer is good with the lockdown, and the $465,611-a-year social welfare queen does not appear disturbed by the millions now out of work, the countless businesses going bust, and the students missing school. Barbara Ferrer is not a medical doctor but she boasts a background in the non-disciplines of \u201ccommunity studies\u201d and \u201csocial welfare.\u201d That makes Barbara Ferrer the ideal choice for politicians eager to exploit a pandemic for political ends, even if it deprives the people of their most basic rights.","news_guard_score":17.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1558,"url":"https:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/2020\/05\/20\/bill-gates-backed-coronavirus-testing-program-shut-down-by-the-fda\/","publisher":"Waking Times","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":"['John Vibes']","title":"Bill Gates-Backed Coronavirus Testing Program Shut Down By The FDA","image":"https:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/My-Post-46.jpg","body_text":"Sen.

Same thing with PPE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question in my mind that if the president had taken a very different approach to this from the beginning \u2014 invoked the Defense Production Act immediately to push manufacturing of PPE, test supplies, all of those things that were desperately needed early on so that we weren't competing in a global marketplace for those same products \u2014 that we would be in a very different place,\u201d said Jayapal.\n\nNow, even as many states begin the process of reopening their economies, Jayapal remains concerned about the U.S.\u2019s lagging response \u2014 and the double-standard she sees between the working conditions most Americans will face and the way the White House is approaching the virus when it comes to its own employees.\n\n\u201cWhile people want to get back to work \u2026 the reality is we're not ready yet,\u201d said Jayapal. \u201cWe don't have the extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation in place. And you look at the White House and Donald Trump \u2014 they're testing everybody. They're doing contact tracing and isolating. Well, if the White House is doing that for their folks, they should make sure that everybody in the country has that. And that is not the case right now.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Jayapal spoke with POLITICO\u2019s Anna Palmer. What follows are excerpts of that interview, edited for length and readability. For more, listen to the interview on the newest episode of Women Rule .\n\nAnna Palmer: Before we get started on everything happening in Congress \u2014 and there's a lot to cover \u2014 I wanted to see if we could get a quick update on what's happening in your district, which is in the Seattle region and was one of the earliest hit by the coronavirus.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal: Our first case was the first case in the country, and it was diagnosed on January 21st. So, in many ways, our state has been at the forefront of leading the response, and a lot of other places have looked to us. We were able to flatten the curve significantly by restrictions early on. We just, however, passed our 1,000th fatality, and we are still struggling with all the things that many other states are struggling with. We have flattened the curve, but the problem is we're still seeing hundreds of cases every day and we don't have the testing\/treatment\/isolation capacity in place that we need to have even as we start to reopen slowly.\n\nFor my constituents, what I hear every day is they're devastated. They're incredibly anxious. There are a lot of frontline workers who are still working without safety. A lot of people who still have not received a stimulus check. Our employment system is, I think, excellent. But the reality is there are too many people on unemployment. And so the unemployment insurance system is creaking and groaning under the weight of just too much too quickly. There are a lot of people who still haven't received their unemployment claims, even though we are better than other states. So people are saying to me, 'I'm getting kicked out of my home, I haven't received my unemployment, the stimulus check is not enough, even if I have gotten it. And I don't know what I don't know how to think about life.' And that anxiety is palpable from the hundreds of calls I get every day.\n\nPalmer: There's spent a lot of criticism about the fits and starts of how this administration has approached not only in getting PPE, but testing and its advice for reopening the country. Yesterday, the president made a lot of news over the fact that he said he was taking an untested drug that a lot of experts have said is unsafe. He's still not wearing a mask. How impactful do you think it is that the president is kind of on a different page than a lot of his health experts and what a lot of the experts around the country are saying about how to approach this crisis?\n\nJayapal: It's enormous. This president has been intransigent about how he has approached this crisis, this pandemic. Everything from false information \u2014 whether it's about drugs, disinfectants, vaccines \u2014 you know, completely ignoring public health, railing on the CDC, which is our friend in this moment and needs all the backup possible.\n\nThere is no question in my mind that if the president had taken a very different approach to this from the beginning \u2014 invoked the Defense Production Act immediately to push manufacturing of PPE, test supplies, all of those things that were desperately needed early on so that we weren't competing in a global marketplace for those same products \u2014 that we would be in a very different place. We would have expanded testing significantly. We would have had the PPE for frontline workers. States would have followed the lead and guidance of the federal government, which is exactly what the federal government should be doing: providing the leadership and the guidance to states so that they know what they should be doing and how they should go about both shuttering their economies and reopening when safe. None of that has happened. None of that.\n\nIt has been incredibly frustrating to watch because states have sort of been left to play out \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d on procuring swabs. I mean, literally, we have governors, my governor included, calling random people in China to try to get swabs off the back of a truck somewhere and get them here, only to find out then that perhaps they're not validated; they're not good for use. Same thing with PPE. I just think that the president has sort of come to this place where he's willing to sacrifice people's lives. And that's all that I see happening.\n\nSo the evaluation that has come from the Institute of Health Metrics, which is right here in my district \u2014 it's the evaluation models for fatalities that the White House touted early on. They have now increased their number of deaths, projected fatalities to a median of 132,000, I think it is, with a high of 233,000. So just imagine potentially looking at a quarter-million deaths. We have already long surpassed the [American death toll from the] Vietnam War. We may get to a place where we quickly surpass World War I deaths of American lives. And so I just think that this administration is intransigent and cruel in how its approached this pandemic.\n\nPalmer: There's been a ton of questions about whether the Capitol is prepared to safely reopen. Is that something you're concerned about? Have you taken any extra precautions just based on what you are seeing and best practices that maybe aren't being forced upon you, but that you want to take to keep people safe?\n\nJayapal: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we have taken a lot of precautions. We're still telling everybody to telework, to work from home. I don't think we're safe yet to go back to work. And I think that that's true in the Capitol; it's true in workplaces across the country. At this point, it's not mandated that you wear a mask on the floor [of the House]. And there were mostly Republicans who were not wearing masks when they walked into the elevator, when they came onto the floor. The reality here is that while people want to get back to work and I think we should talk about why that is, because I think there are a few different reasons and some of them we can mitigate. The reality is we're not ready yet. We don't have the extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation in place. And you look at the White House and Donald Trump, you know, they're testing everybody. They're doing contact tracing and isolating. Well, if the White House is doing that for their folks, they should make sure that everybody in the country has that. And that is not the case right now. That is not the case in the Capitol, but it's also not the case in workplaces across the country. We're sending workers back when it's completely unsafe with no regard to their safety.\n\nPalmer: I want to take a step back a bit. You've been through a lot of firsts. You were the first Indian-American woman to serve in the U.S. House, the first woman to represent your district and the first Asian-American to represent Washington state in Congress \u2014\n\nJayapal: And the first person of color the Democrats have ever sent to Congress [from Washington state], actually.\n\nPalmer: Talk about that just in terms of the historic nature of all of those \u201cfirsts.\u201d Did you feel extra pressure?\n\nJayapal: I've always sort of been in that position. You know, I came to the United States when I was 16 by myself as an immigrant. My parents have never lived on the same continent as me since that time. And so, yes, there's always been real pressure to succeed, because when your parents make that kind of a sacrifice \u2014 and they were not wealthy, they had about $5,000 in their bank account; they used all of it to send me here \u2014 I think you do feel that additional pressure to always succeed. Mostly, that's a good thing. And sometimes, you know, it's a self-flagellating thing. But yes, I think I've often been in that situation: the only person of color, the only woman of color.\n\nI ran for the state Senate and served there for two years before coming to Congress. I was the only woman of color in the state Senate. And that's in what's thought of as a relatively liberal state. I take pride in that only because I think it provides a different way for other people to see their futures. Of course, I'm proud of it for myself. But the real benefit is that I never want to be the last. And so how do I use this opportunity to help change that dynamic for other people? And I think so many people tell me that they see their futures differently because I am here. And that, to me, is a source of great pride.\n\nPalmer: It must have been lonely, I imagine, in some cases to be kind of the first.\n\nJayapal: It is lonely, yes. It is lonely. But I think that a lot of leadership is lonely. If you are really providing true leadership, it often means that you're there before other people are there. I think that's true of some of the most important policies that I push.\n\nPalmer: Something that comes up in Women Rule conversations a lot is facing sexism in the workplace. You've talked about it in regards to Congress. Can you give us a little bit of the backstory there?\n\nJayapal: Yes, definitely. I definitely have to deal with it. For sure. As you know, it's it's sort of baked into our structures. You know, it's baked into the way people see us. But I think I think that, you know, you can't let that stop you. And the question is, really, do you engage with every incident of sexism or do you try to be a little bit more strategic? I pity the poor men who are so afraid of our talents as women, because most of the time it's because of their insecurity and not because of anything that we have done. You know, if only they could, you know, we could all be as big as we really are able to be without people feeling like they get small because we are big.\n\nPalmer: I want to talk to you about the Heroes Act, the $3 trillion bill House Democrats voted on last week. There's obviously been a lot of criticism about it from the more progressive wing that it didn't go far enough; criticism from moderates that taking the vote could hurt them in the election; Republicans just critical of the bill in general \u2014 that it wasn't a serious bill to go to war with next coronavirus relief package. You helped negotiate parts of that bill, but then voted against it. Can you kind of walk us through your thinking?\n\nJayapal: Absolutely. So a couple of things. One, it is absolutely urgent for us to respond. There is deep devastation. And Congress not acting is really not an option. So that's the first thing. The second thing is there were some good things in the package, and I'm grateful to the people who negotiated for those things \u2014 and some of them included things that were my priorities as well. But this takes me to my third point: I really believe that a proposal that originates in the Democratic House should have a very clear focus on the things that we can do that are really going to solve or make a huge impact in the crisis that's facing us, and that the scale has to be big enough. It's not the amount of money, by the way; I think the amount of money was fine; I could have spent more. The issue is what solutions are we offering? We needed a solution around jobs, recovering paychecks and putting money consistently in people's pockets and protecting small businesses.\n\nI had been pushing for my Paycheck Guarantee Act, which is now called the Paycheck Recovery Act. We just introduced it [on Tuesday morning] with 92 co-sponsors, including many, many moderates, because we Democrats should be the party of keeping workers in their jobs and not sending them off onto unemployment. If you do that, the second part of the solution is you can target the assistance that you need \u2014 whether it's rental assistance, stimulus checks, etc. \u2014 to the people who need it the most, because most people now hopefully will be getting paychecks and that will take care of rent, that will take care food on the table, that will provide some consistency for them and certainty around what they can do with their lives going forward. Then you target the other assistance to the people that need it the most.\n\nTo me, the package should have included solutions that would have ensured health care for everyone. And I'm not talking about Medicare for All; I'm talking about all kinds of other ways you can do that. And also would have ensured that people could keep their jobs and that we could end mass unemployment or at least dramatically reduce it. That's what most countries around the world have done. And that's certainly what the United States of America should do.\n\nWe now have 36 million Americans who have filed for unemployment in just the last eight weeks. And if we don't do something, we will be at 40 and 50 percent unemployment and it will be incredibly difficult for the economy to recover. And frankly, all of the structural inequities around race and gender will be so baked in, because those are the people that have the hardest time coming out of unemployment and finding a job because of the discrimination in the system. So I genuinely felt I couldn't vote for it.\n\nPalmer: There's been some likening of the progressive wing of the House Democrats to the Freedom Caucus, the conservative group of Republicans. The Freedom Caucus started to kill bills or stop legislative process in order to enact their will on the chamber. Is there a time in the future where you, as a leader of the progressives, feel like you are going to take more of those strong-arm tactics, or is that just not the style of politics that's within the Democratic Party?\n\nJayapal: I always resist comparisons to the Freedom Caucus, because I think the Freedom Caucus was a party of \"no\" and the Progressive Caucus as a party of \"yes.\" But is it true that we need to be willing to flex our muscles, if you will? I mean, we've done it a few times with some success. When Nancy Pelosi was being elected speaker of the House, we negotiated some very important things. Not everybody understands how important they were, but you wouldn't see Katie Porter on the Financial Services Committee or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Financial Services Committee if we hadn't negotiated to get freshmen onto those committees and to get a certain number of progressives onto all of these committees. And so we have done that effectively. We did it around a budget fight, as well.\n\nI think that we just need to get a little bit more comfortable in two things. [One is] really being united around one specific ask. I don't think we do that very well because progressives care about a lot of things and so it becomes difficult to say, well, this is the one thing that if it's not in the bill, we won't vote for it. And I think the second issue is we do have to get comfortable with recognizing that power never concedes anything without a demand, as Frederick Douglass said. There is no reason to change the way things are if you don't actually give a challenge to it. And it doesn't mean that you're taking on leadership in a negative way. That's not how I think about it.\n\nI think of Nancy Pelosi as being a master negotiator, and she thinks in terms of her votes, she is incredibly hard working. She never sleeps. She's quite brilliant in any number of things, and one of them is the art of negotiation. She understands power very well; she used it on her own as a young legislator coming to Congress and standing up against leadership on AIDS funding. People have to understand that it isn't a slap in the face to leadership to take something on and to try to make it better; sometimes they may even be looking for that every once in a while, though, they'll never say it.\n\nTo hear more, listen to the full podcast episode here.

He hopes to hit the stage again in June to launch a new drive-in concert series in his first return to live music with fans since the devastating coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a surreal kind of setting,\u201d Jones said of plans to play acoustically to 400 cars full of people at the new Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington, Texas.\n\nAs states start to let businesses reopen under limitations, music industry organizers are testing out new models of smaller, socially distant concerts. Jones is cautiously optimistic that drive-in concerts might help crack open a door for musicians that slammed shut so quickly in March.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be one of those last industries, those last segments that opens up, unfortunately,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI do hope that everybody is cautious and opens up appropriately and slowly.\u201d\n\nGeorge Couri, of artist management company Triple 8 Management, teamed up with the Rangers to put on the four-night concert series called Concert in Your Car starting June 4. The interest was so high that tickets sold out quickly and additional shows were added. In all 3,200 tickets have been sold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about creating an experience for live music again,\u201d said Couri. \u201cThe big driver for me is to prove it can work. It would give people hope that this can be repeated again and again in many different places.\u201d\n\nStaying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nMore:Travis McCready concert shut down by coronavirus concerns gets official OK from Arkansas\n\nBut the path ahead for live concerts hasn\u2019t been easy. A venue in Arkansas initially had to postpone an indoor concert that would have defied the state\u2019s ban on large gatherings after health officials ordered the show shut down. The concert featuring singer Travis McCready went on Monday night.\n\nDrive-in concerts aren\u2019t new, but in the wake of the pandemic, the idea hit in Europe and now the United States. Country star Keith Urban played a drive-in theater in Tennessee last week with scaled back production and crew, but he said that he thinks the concert industry in the near future will pivot to a drive-in style, but with larger capacity.\n\n\u201cThe stage is going to be coming out to the parking lot and people will be staying in their cars,\u201d said Urban. \u201cIt will be an endless tailgate party.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, DJ D-Nice, who has been entertaining people online with his popular DJ sets on Instagram called #ClubQuarantine, played music for first-responders in their cars on Saturday. Concert promoter and venue operator Live Nation is planning to test fanless concerts, drive-in concerts and \u201creduced capacity shows\u201d both indoors and outdoors, according to President and CEO Michael Rapino, who spoke about the ideas on an investor call.\n\nTailgate Fest in California already proved the car-centered concert was a viable option before the pandemic. The country music festival where fans are encouraged to watch from their RVs, trucks or cars is going into its third year this August.\n\nMelissa Carbone, the CEO of Tailgate Fest, said there are a lot of changes coming to the festival this year because of the coronavirus, including removing a general admission pit area and a VIP pool party, and they are expecting attendance to drop from last year\u2019s high of 25,000. But the lineup of Dierks Bentley, Lynyrd Skynyrd and TLC hasn\u2019t changed as of yet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ahead of the curve on it and nobody wants to see live music go away,\u201d said Carbone.\n\nThe World Health Organization has guidance and risk assessments for mass gatherings during the COVID-19 outbreak, said Lucia Mullen, an analyst at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and part of the WHO\u2019s expert cell for mass gatherings and COVID-19.\n\nFor concerts, Mullen said recommendations included moving events outdoors, limiting attendance, spacing people out, taking temperatures of participants and staff, hand sanitizing stations and extra cleaning. But she said organizers should also look at the aftereffects of holding a mass gathering in an outbreak, such as contract tracing.\n\n\u201cDo they know who is going there so they can follow up with them if they do find out there is a case and alert all of the participants so they can go get themselves checked out?\u201d asked Mullen.\n\nRelated:Once the coronavirus pandemic subsides, will music lovers pick streaming over in-person concerts?\n\nMore:Pearl Jam, Greta Thunberg paint grim picture of environment's future in 'Retrograde' video\n\nIn a rapidly changing outbreak, Mullen said event organizers should rely heavily on the advice of local health officials in their areas.\n\n\u201cMere weeks can change an epidemiological context in a city,\u201d she said.\n\nFor most bands, touring is a large majority of their income, well above what they get for releasing albums. But Couri said this initial launch of drive-in concerts at the Texas stadium won\u2019t be a huge money-making endeavor early on.\n\nThey are charging $40 for each car, and all tickets have to be purchased in advance, not on-site. No concessions or merchandise will be available for sale to reduce contact between people. All bands will play acoustically so there\u2019s minimal production crew needed. There won\u2019t even be outdoor speakers because the music will be transmitted by radio.\n\nJones said for him and the members of Eli Young Band, they aren\u2019t doing the drive-in concerts solely to make up lost income, but instead to give music back to the fans.\n\n\u201cI think people need something safe that they can go do and if we can be that, that\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Jones.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1579,"url":"https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/sports\/high-school\/2020\/05\/20\/its-tough-covid-19-denies-oak-park-girls-track-teams-run-another-three-peat\/5227294002\/","publisher":"The Detroit News","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":"['David Goricki']","title":"'It's tough': COVID-19 denies Oak Park girls track team's run at another three-peat","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/20\/PDTN\/71acfd9a-a609-47b6-baf2-136867b656b0-OPT.jpg?crop=1999,1124,x1,y263&width=1600&height=800&fit=bounds","body_text":"Brandon Jiles has built Oak Park\u2019s girls track team into a dynasty, but its dream of a sixth state title in seven years was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe coronavirus put an end to the careers of seniors Aasia Laurencin, Jayla Jones, Kourtney Kennard and N\u2019Stajah Banks.\n\n\u201cIt was tough because the kids worked really hard, ran cross country in the fall and most of them ran indoor track, so not being able to compete kind of put a damper in all of the work they put in,\" Jiles said. \"But at the end of the day the kids did understand that the health and safety of everybody is more important than sport. It was a good learning lesson, but at the same time it was a little painful as well.\n\nThe Oak Park girls track team has won five out of the last six Division 1 state titles. (Photo: Courtesy of Brandon Jiles)\n\n\u201cI had four senior girls who were contributors and three of them had decided on schools. Aasia is going to Texas, Jayla Jones is going to North Carolina A&T and Kourtney Kennard is going to the University of Memphis on an academic scholarship. They ran pretty well so it didn\u2019t hurt them as bad as it would hurt some kids, but at the same time still not being able to compete and win state championships and national titles was kind of a rough day for them.\n\n\u201cWe won three state titles in a row \u2014 2014, 2015 and 2016 \u2014 were second in \u201917, and then won again in \u201918 and \u201919, so we were trying to win three in a row again. It\u2019s tough because usually good track programs last four years and then they top off. We were trying to keep it going.\u201d\n\nJiles will have a talented lineup to work with next year in Chloe Vines, Morgan Atlas, Tamyra Todd and Jada Roundtree. Vines placed second in the Division 1 state meet in the 400 meters (54.22 seconds) and fifth in the 200 meters (24.97) as a freshman last year. Atlas placed fifth in the 300-meter hurdles (43.94) as a freshman. Todd placed seventh in the 400 meters (57.54) as a sophomore and Roundtree, who did not compete last season, was the indoor state champion in the 400 meters (55.81) this past winter.\n\nBut Jiles wanted to see Laurencin perform this spring after she placed second in the state the previous two years to White Lake Lakeland's Grace Stark, who was the fastest 100-meter hurdler in state history (13.16). Stark earned the title of 2020 Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year as a member of the Florida Gators and broke the World U20 record in the 60-meter hurdles twice at the SEC Indoors (7.93 seconds, then 7.91).\n\n\u201cAasia is a multi-time AAU Junior Olympic champion, an All-American in the hurdles and it\u2019s just crazy because she had been running behind Grace Stark,\" Jiles said. \"It was finally her senior year and her turn to win a state title in her event, the 100 hurdles, but she didn\u2019t have a season so that was real tough for her.\n\n\u201cAasia finished second twice, as a sophomore and junior, when Grace Stark was the No. 1 hurdler in the nation. But Aasia is a smart kid. She\u2019ll be very successful at Texas, has one of the best coaches in the world and she\u2019s going to one of the better track schools in the nation, so things will work out.\u201d\n\nLaurencin had big plans, eyeing titles at the state meet in June as well as in the New Balance Nationals later in the summer. Now she plans to continue to train, then travel to Austin to begin her college career in August.\n\nAasia Laurencin (Photo: Courtesy of Brandon Jiles)\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking but knew it was coming. You know the disappointment so I\u2019m just getting ready for college now,\" said Laurencin who is the National Honor Society president, owns a 3.95 GPA and plans to major in Neuroscience or computer science at Texas. \"I'm going to (Farmington Hills) Harrison\u2019s track to run, then I work out at home, have an area where I do core work and get on the bike. My mom helps since she\u2019s a personal trainer.\n\n\u201cPeople know me for the 100-meter hurdles. I\u2019m top three in the nation in the 60-hurdles and 100-hurdles. My next event specialty is the 200-meter dash where my (personal record) is 24.20, which is among the top in the Michigan all-time lists, and I ran the third fastest time ever in the hurdles, a 13.43.\u201d\n\nSo why Texas?\n\n\u201cCoach Edrick Floreal is phenomenal. He coached the reigning world record holder in the 100-meter hurdles, Keni Harrison, who ran a 12.20 to break the world record. Their academics are amazing, and I love the warm weather,\u201d Laurencin said. \u201cUniversity of Texas has been communicating and said the sports teams will return in August, so that\u2019s the plan, to get there in August.\u201d\n\nJones and Kennard were part of Oak Park\u2019s winning 1,600-meter relay team last year \u2014 an MHSAA state meet record at 3 minutes, 45.13 seconds \u2014 while Jones also played a part in Oak Park\u2019s 1,600- and 3,200-meter relay teams in 2018. Banks placed fourth in the 300 hurdles last year.\n\n\u201cJayla was third last year in the Division 1 state championships in the 800. She was our best cross country runner in the fall and has developed into a leader as she got older,\u201d Jiles said. \u201cThe crazy thing is I\u2019ve known Jayla since she was a baby since her mom ran at (Detroit) Mumford with me. Ada (Jones) graduated from Mumford in \u201997 so I\u2019ve known Jayla since she was a little kid and I\u2019m very proud of her.\u201d\n\nJones was looking forward to taking official visits to Virginia Commonwealth, Norfolk State, Florida A&M and North Carolina A&T. She competed in the New Balance Outdoors at North Carolina A&T following the high school season last summer but did not take a tour of the school.\n\n\u201cI was looking forward to performing in an Oak Park uniform and I won\u2019t be able to do that again,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI specialize in the 800 and just love running it. My best time is 2:12 and I really wanted to run a 2:10 or under and win state.\u201d\n\nJones has been keeping busy running up to six miles a day to get ready for cross country this fall at A&T. She has a 3.6 GPA and plans to become a pharmacist.\n\ndavid.goricki@detroitnews.com","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1596,"url":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/apple-google-making-covid-19-170000769.html","publisher":"Yahoo!

Apple and Google have spent weeks finessing the privacy elements of the app, as well as improving the level of control for public health agencies.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nApple and Google have started rolling out their COVID-19 contact tracing tech in a publicly available software update, meaning public health agencies can start building it into apps.\n\nThe arrival of the application programming interface (API) \u2013 which Apple and Google now officially call the exposure notifications system \u2013 means public health agencies can begin to roll out their own contact tracing apps to users.\n\nThe software will use Bluetooth to detect other smartphones in close proximity and alert the user \u2013 assuming they have a relevant health app installed \u2013 if they come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe companies said that 22 countries on five continents have received access to the API, along with three US states: Alabama, South Carolina, and North Dakota. More locations will get access in the coming weeks, Apple and Google said.\n\nSpokespeople for Google and Apple said that in most cases the API will only be available to one app per country, but said exceptions could be made. However, this does not appear to be the case for the US, where individual states are creating their own apps.\n\nApple and Google consulted with several public health groups to finesse the API, including the CDC Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nOff the back of those talks, the API has been tweaked with several improvements for health agencies, including letting agencies themselves decide what constitutes \"an exposure event\" between people, and determine the level of risk from instances of someone coming into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe companies said they will continue to update and improve the API as they get feedback from public health authorities.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple and Google gave us a preview of what the interface might look like on iPhones and Android smartphones. It also recently announced it had tightened some of the privacy controls around the tech, including encrypting the data that gets shared via Bluetooth.\n\nBut the bigger challenge will be for public health agencies to get people to download their apps. One study has suggested that 60% of the population would need to adopt these apps for the technology to be effective, but according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, nearly three in five Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology.\n\nThe UK is currently trialing its own NHS contract tracking app, which has been criticized by cybersecurity researchers who discovered several security risks.\n\nHowever, it was recently reported that the NHS could be working on a separate app that uses Google and Apple's API.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1601,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/2020\/05\/20\/michigan-floodwaters-mcdonalds-workers-strike-coronavirus-pandemic\/5211321002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":[],"title":"Coronavirus pandemic, Michigan floodwaters, McDonald's workers strike: 5 things to know Wednesday","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/a25cc4d5877a7de0f911736664113501ea7c37c0\/c=0-0-1280-720\/local\/-\/media\/2020\/05\/08\/USATODAY\/usatsports\/MotleyFool-TMOT-414c042a-disdisneysprings.jpg?width=1280&height=720&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMichigan residents on alert as Midland could be under 9 feet of water\n\nUrging residents to evacuate and warning that downtown Midland could be under 9 feet of water by Wednesday afternoon, Gov.

Literally.\n\nGrocery store bills shot up April, showing the biggest monthly increase in nearly 50 years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's monthly Consumer Price Index report.\n\nWhile overall the April CPI declined 0.8%, consumers on average paid 2.6% more for groceries. It's the largest one-month increase since February 1974. During the last 12 months, grocery prices rose 4.1%.\n\nPrice increases in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category were the steepest.\n\nMary Kay Ash of Clinton Township, Michigan, is among those who have noticed their average weekly grocery receipts are on the rise. The 54-year-old mom says she typically spent about $100 to $125 a week on groceries for a family of four adults before the pandemic. Now, she says, she is spending $140 to $150.\n\nTarget sales up 11%:Retailer's Drive Up and Shipt delivery grew by 278% fueled by COVID-19\n\n'The new way':Businesses pivot by selling care packages, virtual events to survive coronavirus pandemic\n\nHer shopping plan means getting to the store early Sunday mornings. She shops in produce first, then heads over to the meat department to see what's available.\n\nAsh said she has noticed grocery prices are up, especially on meat, but also on just about everything, including produce.\n\nRegional CPI statistics are reported on a bimonthly basis. The most current report showed consumers in metro Detroit, for instance, paid 3.3% more for groceries from February to April, the Labor Department said.\n\nIncreases reflect classic supply-and-demand economics. Disruptions in the food supply linked to meat processing plant closures and slowdowns, along with a shift in production from restaurants and institutions to retail, led to increases. You can also toss in panic buying.\n\nSeveral food categories had steep increases.\n\nPrices in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category had the biggest monthly increase as consumers paid 4.3% more for those items in April. Prices were nearly 7% higher over the last 12 months.\n\nWhen broken out into individual products, egg prices had the biggest jump as consumers paid 16.1% more in April than in March for eggs. Prices for eggs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were as high as $3 a dozen in April.\n\nBut now, wholesale shell egg prices are at a level closer to what they are expected to be, said Trey Malone, Michigan State University agriculture economist.\n\n\"Trend lines in eggs had a massive spike in April and now, as of May 18, it's down,\" said Malone.\n\nMultiple regulations by the federal government were relaxed to allow the shell egg industry to shift supply of eggs from restaurants to retail, Malone said.\n\nThe USDA's May 18 Egg News Report has wholesale prices of eggs averaging about $1 a dozen.\n\nWhile Malone is convinced that overall prices have increased, it's not entirely clear how the CPI goes out and looks at prices in the middle of a pandemic.\n\n\"What the CPI is telling you here is something that is changing rapidly,\" he said.\n\nMalone expect price increases to continue at least on the meat side because of a decrease in supply of animals. Contributing to that is the euthanizing of animals by farmers because some processing plants were down with sick workers and an increase in exports.\n\nWith pork, Malone also cites a jump in demand for pork exports. Before COVID-19, China was hit with an African swine fever in hogs.\n\nGrocery pork prices were up 3% in April. What's also going on is there's a shortage of certain pork cuts.\n\n\"In the U.S., we've gotten very comfortable with this proliferation of options at the grocery stores,\" Malone said. \"Right now, the system is having to flex in a way that we are just going to have to expect there's a limited, smaller number of items in the market while simultaneously the prices will increase. \"\n\nUncooked ground beef was up 4.8% in April, beef roasts were up 5% and beef steaks saw a 2.1% jump, the Labor Department said. Year over year, ground beef was up a whopping 9.7%.\n\nGround beef prices have taken Ash by surprise during this pandemic.

The study was limited to cases treated in hospital and therefore does not apply to patients who experienced milder symptoms or were asymptomatic.\n\nThe results of the analysis, published in The Lancet Psychiatry suggest that whereas most patients will not suffer immediate mental health effects, certain complications like depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could emerge in the months and years that follow hospitalization.\n\nTwo studies that systematically assessed common symptoms in a panel of 129 patients hospitalized with SARS and MERS noted various mental disorders such as confusion (28%), low mood (32%), anxiety (35%), impaired memory (34%) and insomnia (42%).\n\nTwelve studies of patients with Covid-19 painted a similar picture with evidence of delirium in 26 out of 40 intensive-care patients, agitation in 40 out of 58 intensive-care patients, and altered consciousness in 17 out of 82 patients who subsequently died.\n\nSix other studies of patients with SARS and MERS also found frequent reports of low mood (11%), insomnia (12%), anxiety (12%), irritability (13%), memory impairment (19%), fatigue (19%), and frequent recall of traumatic memories (30%) over a follow-up period ranging from 6 weeks to 39 months.\n\n\"While there is little evidence to suggest that common mental illnesses beyond short-term delirium are a feature of COVID-19 infection, clinicians should monitor for the possibility that common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, and PTSD could arise in the weeks and months following recovery from severe infection, as has been seen with SARS and MERS\", points out Dr. Jonathan Rogers, a researcher from University College London, UK, and a co-author of the study.","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1621,"url":"https:\/\/europe.infowars.com\/nigel-farage-accuses-france-of-escorting-migrant-boats-into-uk\/","publisher":"InfoWars","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":[],"title":"Nigel Farage Accuses France of Escorting Migrant Boats Into UK","image":"https:\/\/europe.infowars.com\/content\/images\/2020\/05\/farage.jpg","body_text":"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing travel restrictions shutting down previously-favoured land routes, according to French and British border authorities, there has been a surge in the number of migrants crossing the Channel from France to the UK in small boats despite the perils of currents and low temperatures.\n\nAs record numbers of migrants are attempting the perilous sea crossing into the UK in dinghies, the finger of blame has been pointed at France for assisting what has been dubbed an \u201cinvasion\u201d of illegals, reports The Times.\n\nThe reports came after French border patrol ships were captured on film escorting the small boats packed with migrants crossing the Channel.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage chartered a fishing boat on 20 May to substantiate his accusation that the French navy was escorting illegal migrants into UK waters.\n\nFarage \u201crescued\u201d over 20 migrants who were floundering in two boats that were taking in water.\n\nSlamming the \u201cinvasion,\" he tweeted that it was time to act to put an end to the practice.\n\nI just witnessed the French Navy escorting illegal migrants into British waters, despite the money we are paying them.\n\n\n\nThey even tried to prevent us from filming the handover, as you can see in the video.\n\n\n\nThis is an outrage and a scandal.

They also need to be far more serious about rounding up the people smugglers involved in this.\u201d\n\nYou can read this article as it originally appears at Sputnik here.\n\nPaul Joseph Watson joins The Alex Jones Show to break down the dubious numbers being used to lock down society and cause more deaths than the coronavirus.\n\n(PHOTO: Nigel Farage \/ Twitter)","news_guard_score":25,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1631,"url":"https:\/\/www.healthnutnews.com\/florida-scientist-said-she-was-fired-for-refusing-to-manipulate-covid-19-data\/","publisher":"Health Nut News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Erin Elizabeth']","title":"FOX: DeSantis: Former Manager of Coronavirus Dashboard \u201cNot a Data Scientist;\u201d Faces Cyber-Stalking Charge","image":"https:\/\/www.healthnutnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot_2020-05-20-DeSantis-Former-manager-of-coronavirus-dashboard-not-a-data-scientist-faces-cyber-stalking-charge.png","body_text":"Rebekah Jones, a geospatial scientist formerly with the state Department of Health, reportedly told several media outlets she was asked to remove data showing that COVID-19 patients first reported symptoms earlier than state officials originally announced. She claimed that when she refused to \u201cmanually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen,\u201d she was given the choice to resign or be fired.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he did not know Jones, but he insisted her termination was over her \u201cinsubordination\u201d \u2014 not over any refusal to alter state data.\n\nDuring a press conference Wednesday afternoon with Vice President Mike Pence, DeSantis went further, disputing nearly every claim Jones made in recent interviews.\n\n\u201cOne, she is not a data scientist. She is somebody that\u2019s got a degree in journalism, communication and geography. She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that, she is not an epidemiologist, she is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,\u201d the governor said. \u201cShe was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn\u2019t believe was valid data. So, she didn\u2019t listen to people who were her superiors, she had many people above her in the chain of command. And so then she was dismissed because of that.\u201d\n\nThen, DeSantis said Jones is under \u201cactive criminal charges\u201d in Florida, which includes cyber-stalking and cyber-sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cI have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,\u201d the governor said, adding that he was asking the Department of Health to explain how she had remained employed despite the charges.\n\nRecords in the Leon County Clerk of Court website show Rebekah Jones was involved in cases matching what the governor said. In October 2017 and in June 2019, a temporary injunction for stalking was filed against her in Leon County. Those cases are closed.\n\nIn July 2019, a stalking case was filed by the state of Florida against Jones. The case remains open.\n\nFOX 13 has reached out to Jones, but we have not heard back.\n\nFOX 13 asked the governor\u2019s office what questionable data Jones was putting online and his spokesperson offered this reply:\n\n\u201cRebeka [sic] Jones acted as if she had ownership of the Department of Health Dashboard website and disregarded the direction given to her by subject matter experts such as the Senior Epidemiologists, Senior Data Analysts and supervisors. She was resistant to publishing data on the website she disagreed with going against the judgement of the epidemiologists, senior data analysts and supervisors. Event Date is a field that can be queried on the dashboard that marks the beginning of the epidemiological investigation which is based on self-reporting of information that is not medically certified. The science and public health experts believe the best information is the actual clinical diagnosis of the disease verified by COVID-19 diagnostic testing,\u201d Helen Aguirre Ferre wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, some Democratic senators began demanding an investigation into Jones\u2019 claims about data manipulation after her claims got national attention Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are making public policy decisions based on that information,\u201d state Sen. Lori Berman of Boynton Beach said. \u201cIf it is being falsified, we need to know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur data is available. Our data is transparent. Any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative,\u201d DeSantis countered Wednesday, pointing to Florida\u2019s comparatively low mortality rate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve succeeded and I think that people just don\u2019t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption. So they gotta try and find a boogeyman,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s that there are black helicopters circling the Department of Health.

The United States has been slow to get started with mass testing, especially of asymptomatic individuals, and the tests are mostly controlled by government agencies like the CDC. The tests currently available have also been criticized for being inaccurate. Just last week, the FDA issued a warning about tests made by Abbott Laboratories, saying that they often gave falsely negative results.\n\nJohn Vibes is an author and journalist who takes a special interest in the counter culture, and focuses solutions-oriented approaches to social problems.

At a time when the US is leading the world with deaths and infections from the disease, the Pentagon views flexing muscles with warplanes in the Asia Pacific is somehow a demonstration of American potency.\n\nWhile the American public is crying out for more resources to cope with the pandemic, Washington sees fit to ramp up militarism not just in the Asia Pacific, but also in the Arctic region, the Persian Gulf and the Caribbean.\n\nUS warships despatched to the Caribbean are said to be on a mission to counter-narcotic trafficking. Few people will buy that pretext. The military force is deployed as a threat to Venezuela and its socialist government which the Trump administration has openly targeted for regime change.\n\nA failed coup attempt earlier this month involving a private US mercenary outfit may or may not have had official support from the White House.\n\nBut one thing is clear: when Russia proposed a statement of support for Venezuela at the UN Security Council this week in which the failed coup was denounced as a violation of the UN charter forbidding aggression, the draft statement was \u201ckilled\u201d by Washington\u2019s envoy.\n\nThe implication is that Washington\u2019s public position sees nothing wrong with aggression despite the flagrant violation of international law that it involves.\n\nIn that case, it could be expected that the US will attempt to block Iranian oil tankers en route to Venezuela. If aggression is acceptable to Washington then why not also a bit of high-seas piracy?\n\nFive Iranian-flagged tankers are due to dock in the South American country in the coming days. They are reportedly ferrying $45 million worth of gasoline to alleviate Venezuela\u2019s crippled economy as it struggles like many other nations to control the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nVenezuela is a major exporter of crude oil but due to US sanctions its capacity to refine fuel has been decimated. This has caused severe shortages for Venezuelan transport which has, in turn, exacerbated the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBoth Venezuela and Iran have warned the US to not interfere in the sea passage of the oil tankers. Both countries have been burdened with American sanctions, but they are legally entitled to conduct bilateral trade. If US warships impede the transport, then it will be viewed by Venezuela and Iran as an act of piracy. We might add that the rest of the world will view it that way too. An act of piracy compounding acts of economic aggression under heartless US sanctions.\n\nGiven the pandemic crisis, Iran\u2019s supply of vital fuel to Venezuela is not merely a normal trade transaction, but a courageous act of solidarity and humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Trump administration has mischievously indicated it will do something to stop the Iranian ships reaching Venezuela. What that something is open to guesswork. Will it use its warships in the Caribbean to mount a blockade?\n\nIran has warned it will retaliate. Perhaps by attacking American warships in the Persian Gulf, where skirmishing has already taken place.\n\nVenezuela says it is sending naval forces to escort the Iranian tankers once they arrive in its territorial waters.\n\nIn the next coming days, a showdown awaits which could have explosive repercussions, not least because the Iranian tankers are reckoned to contain 1.5 million barrels of gasoline.\n\nThe US head of Southern Command, Admiral Craig Faller, this week played down the probability of an armed confrontation with the Iranian vessels.\n\nHe is quoted as saying: \u201cYou have to ask yourself what interest Iran has in Venezuela, where we have seen recent indications of Iranian military and state support?\u201d\n\nEh, let\u2019s guess Admiral Faller, maybe simply an act of solidarity by two nations who are under the boot of American imperialism and illegal sanctions that amount to a crime against humanity.\n\nAmerican global power right now is seen as a farce. It has been devastated by a virus and shown to be a lying cheat over its attempt to smear China and the World Health Organization. Its sanctioning against nations struggling with a deadly disease is barbaric terrorism; and while millions of Americans are facing poverty, the US is sending warships and warplanes to all corners of the world.\n\nWashington won\u2019t dare do piracy in the Caribbean at this juncture. Because it can\u2019t afford another fiasco. Its global image is already in tatters.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1639,"url":"https:\/\/dcdirtylaundry.com\/watch-banned-video-here-after-plandemic-video-goes-super-viral-on-brighteon-com-facebook-bans-all-brighteon-links-regardless-of-content\/","publisher":"DC Dirty Laundry","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Mike Adams']","title":"Watch Banned Video Here: After \u201cPlandemic\u201d video goes super viral on Brighteon.com, Facebook bans all Brighteon links, regardless of content","image":"https:\/\/dcdirtylaundry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/plandemic.png","body_text":"(Natural News) Facebook has initiated a whole new level of tyranny and censorship to try to eliminate any information about the Wuhan coronavirus that disagrees with the World Health Organization, which is largely run by communist China and is currently led by a former member of a violent communist group.\n\nLate last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook\u2019s \u201ccommunity guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the \u201cPlandemic\u201d video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine.

Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.\n\nWe repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.\n\nHow to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned\n\nBecause of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.\n\nEach video on Brighteon.com has a \u201cshare\u201d link at the bottom right-hand corner:\n\nFrom the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the \u201cJesus Social\u201d channel on Brighteon:\n\n<iframe src=\u2019https:\/\/www.brighteon.com\/embed\/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21\u2032 width=\u2019560\u2032 height=\u2019315\u2032 frameborder=\u20190\u2032 allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nAnd here\u2019s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:\n\nOnce the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.\n\nYou can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren\u2019t run by evil globalists working for communist China.\n\nIn the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China\u2019s war against humanity.\n\nThe tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe\n\nWe have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.\n\nThis is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.\n\nHuman freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.\n\nEven if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.\n\nAnd no, that isn\u2019t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.\n\nWatch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are blacklisting entire platforms to prevent her voice from being heard:\n\nNo, you won\u2019t be able to share this story on Facebook.

The total comprises 237 individuals who were tested by the Department of Health or when seeking care through their own health care providers and an additional 2,007 individuals who were tested onsite from May 6 to May 9. Team members who test positive receive paid leave and may return to work only when they have met the criteria established by both the CDC and Tyson.\n\nThe Wilkesboro facility is among an initial group of more than 30 production facilities in the United States where Tyson is rolling out advanced testing capabilities and enhanced care options on-site to team members in partnership with MATRIX MEDICAL, a leading medical clinical services company, and other partners. The company is prioritizing communities with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and will assess additional needs based on significant risk factors and access to testing.\n\nAs it is doing at the Wilkesboro facility, Tyson will disclose verified test results at other plants to health and government officials, team members and stakeholders as part of its efforts to help affected communities where it operates better understand the coronavirus and the protective measures that can be taken to help prevent its spread.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nTrump or Biden, who will win?

Here\u2019s a partial transcript from the video:\n\nJudy Mikovits: The first thing to do is to end the 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation act, which removes all liability. The second thing is a five-year moratorium on all vaccines until they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tested safe and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a lot longer than five years. In those five years,everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to realize they have natural immunity and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see these diseases go away. Close the FDA. Close the CDC. Close the EPA. All of these corrupt organizations, reorganize them. Open them to give back the taxpayers their money to be able to use the medicines naturally.We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put Dr. David Lewis in charge of the EPA. He wrote the book Science for Sale uncovering the corruption in that industry. We can have Dr. Stephanie sent up there over the FDA. No more GMO, no more Roundup so he can do all these things and reject and end the Bayh\u00e2\u0080\u0093Dole Act\u2026 which government employees who are paid with taxpayer money for Health and Human Services to patent their work. No more patents. All the drugs belong to the people. All our brains belong to the people because you paid for our education, everything. That will turn around all of medicine to give it back all doctors equal. No more health insurance. $5000 tax-free account you can spend on anything you want. Your supplement, your cannabis, your chlorine dioxide. You can take care of your health just the way we used to when I was a little kid.\n\nMike Adams: In addition to that outstanding list, I would ask President Trump issue an Executive order expanding the First Amendment to cover truthful speech about nutritional supplements and natural interventions, alternative medicine, healing remedies. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truthful, then it should not be criminal, obviously. If we just shut down the FDA and the FTC and the CDC that would solve the problem as well. Secondly, and this is something President Trump can issue right now, he can issue an Executive Order ordering the FDA to ban direct-to-consumer drug advertisements. They are illegal in almost every country in the world. If he were to do that, he would immediately halt the disease-mongering and the profiteering of the drug companies. He would cut off about 70 percent of the revenues to the fake news industries such as CNN that depends on pharma profits, which is why they are puppets of Big Pharma. He could do that with an Executive Order. Finally, I agree with Dr. Mikovits that patents, there should never be intellectual property claims over drugs. Drugs can be developed by universities. Most of the drug development that happens in the United States is actually funded by the NIH anyway, and drug companies simply exploit that free money so they can make billions off of patented drugs, which are really FDA-enforced drug monopolies. That needs to end.\n\nAndreas Kalcker: I would put to that that when you have the patents, you cannot patent any living entity at all. Life is life and this is not patentable, and this is one of the things that has been put in the last time that has to be out of that. Because if you cannot patent a virus, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no business anymore. The next thing is that you can make the pharmaceutical compound. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need the FDA-approved thing if chlorine dioxide is just approved as a pharmaceutical compound. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very simple substance that can be used and prescribed by every doctor and be made in any simple pharmacy. That would be my dream and the dream of the world. We could end [the pandemic] in a very few months before even the elections. We could end all these drama of coronavirus.\n\nJudy Mikovits: And restore our economy. These gross natural products. This HHS. This whole corrupt monster. Just knock it down. And give us back our freedom.\n\nIn the IAMTV video below, you can hear the suggestions for President Trump beginning at around 28:20.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1647,"url":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2020-05-21-coronavirus-vaccines-will-contain-aborted-human-babies.html","publisher":"Natural News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Ethan Huff']","title":"CONFIRMED: Coronavirus vaccines will contain aborted human babies","image":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/91\/2020\/05\/Coronavirus-Covid-19-Vaccine-Syringe-Lab.jpg","body_text":"(Natural News) Pro-lifers everywhere had better think long and hard about what they plan to do in the event that state or local governments try to mandate vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) once a jab is commercially released because chances are those syringes will contain the remnants of aborted babies.\n\nEven though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.\n\nAfter it was announced recently that Canada\u2019s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.\n\nCanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada\u2019s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers\u2019 wombs.\n\n\u201cSince it\u2019s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,\u201d Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. \u201cHEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won\u2019t even work\n\nBesides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy Canadians,\u201d Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. \u201cYour government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life \u2026 Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.\u201d\n\nWhat is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nThis vaccine is said to be the first \u201cphase 2\u201d coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be \u201csafely\u201d used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to \u201ccure\u201d them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\n\u201cNRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,\u201d stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.\n\nDr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has \u201cstrong connections to Canada\u201d and is \u201cproud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help \u201cto advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.\u201d In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.\n\nMore of the latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is available at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1651,"url":"https:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/news\/2020\/05\/21\/wylie-mayor-defends-belief-that-women-shouldnt-lead-public-prayer\/","publisher":"Drudge Report","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Tom Steele']","title":"Wylie mayor defends belief that women shouldn\u2019t lead public prayer","image":"https:\/\/dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com\/resizer\/d0BhVtGiRvewpAmIsXwUC0I9S9I=\/1200x630\/smart\/filters:no_upscale()\/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com\/dmn\/AHRZSBRRCNBYBDYSK6632VDJTQ.jpg","body_text":"Wylie Mayor Eric Hogue says he believes women can do \u201canything and everything\u201d \u2014 so long as they don\u2019t lead public displays of religion.\n\nHogue is defending his beliefs after the release of an email in which he requests that only male members of a Christian missionary group say a prayer before a City Council meeting.\n\nThe exchange between Hogue and the city\u2019s mayor pro tem, Jeff Forrester, was posted Wednesday on a Facebook page that focuses on the city\u2019s politics.\n\nForrester emailed Hogue last week about the group, Youth With a Mission, asking for the mayor\u2019s thoughts about arranging for its members to attend the council\u2019s next meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Hogue replied, saying it was a good idea \u2014 as long as \u201cthose leading the public prayer be young men.\u201d\n\nWylie Mayor Eric Hogue sent the email to Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Forrester on Sunday. ((custom credit))\n\nHogue, who also is the minister of Wylie\u2019s Cottonwood Church of Christ, quoted two New Testament verses he said he interprets literally.\n\nThe first, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, says: \u201cLet your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.\u201d\n\nThe mayor also quoted a passage from 1 Timothy that says, \u201cLet the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\u201d\n\nHogue wrote that he has always asked for men to lead invocation, while acknowledging that \u201cnot everyone may agree with me, but I can\u2019t go against my conscience.\u201d\n\nHogue did not respond to a request for comment from The Dallas Morning News, but he spoke to local television stations about the email, telling KXAS-TV (NBC5) that his belief extends only to public acts of religion.\n\n\u201cWhat I will say is a woman can do absolutely anything and everything \u2014 but if we\u2019re in a public setting, in a religious setting, the Bible teaches that she\u2019s not to say a public prayer or to lead the singing or to deliver the sermon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated that to WFAA-TV (Channel 8), saying, \u201cI believe a lady can be president of the United States. I believe a lady can be CEO of a company, the superintendent of a school district.\u201d But in the Church of Christ, he said, women don\u2019t lead worship services or singing \u2014 only classes for women and children.\n\nHogue also pointed to his 33-year marriage as a sign of his respect for women.\n\n\u201cMy wife would not stick around if I was anti, you know, like that,\u201d he told WFAA. \u201cI mean, we are equal partners in everything.\u201d\n\nForrester told WFAA he doesn\u2019t share the mayor\u2019s beliefs and was surprised by the email, but he added, \u201cI\u2019ve never observed Mayor Hogue ever speak ill of women.\u201d\n\nHogue, 56, has been Wylie\u2019s mayor for 12 years and is not seeking re-election this year. In addition to leading the church, he is a professional magician and formerly performed as a clown named Clinky.\n\nHogue told NBC5 that he suspects the outcry over his email may be motivated by politics after this month\u2019s election was moved to November because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think the main thing is the budget cycle is coming up, and they would like to have the new council in place,\" he said. \u201cI totally get that, but we are living through a pandemic.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Charles Scudder contributed to this report.","news_guard_score":29.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1654,"url":"https:\/\/dcdirtylaundry.com\/coronavirus-testing-is-really-about-harvesting-your-dna-for-a-government-database\/","publisher":"DC Dirty Laundry","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Ethan Huff']","title":"Coronavirus testing is really about harvesting your DNA for a government database","image":"https:\/\/www.dcclothesline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/DNA-Science.jpg","body_text":"(Natural News) Testing, testing, and more testing: This is all that the government can talk about these days in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic \u2013 that and a future vaccine, of course.

If a vaccine is, in fact, released, chances are it will not be effective nor will it be safe.\n\n\u201cThere are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,\u201d Nabarro is quoted as saying. \u201cWe can\u2019t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.\u201d\n\nWithout a vaccine, experts are automatically predicting that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away and instead become an annual event.

Given their track record, however, doubts remain about the true motivation behind the move.\n\nA supervisor for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Health Commission, Liu Dengfeng, finally admitted in a news conference that the government there issued an order on January 3 directing some facilities to dispose of coronavirus samples. Liu said the order was a measure that aimed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cprevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.\u201d\n\nLiu added that the labs had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cunauthorized\u00e2\u0080\u009d to handle the samples and therefore had to destroy them to comply with public health laws in the country. He stopped short of specifying how the samples were destroyed or why those labs had them in the first place.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been accusing China for months of destroying the samples to cover up the extent of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outbreak. Last month, he expressed frustration with the Chinese government for not sharing virus samples from within the country with the rest of the world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something that makes it impossible to assess the evolution of the disease.\n\nHe has also accused the country of censoring coronavirus research and trying to influence international efforts to fight the disease. He criticized the country for taking too long to report the outbreak to the World Health Organization and said that even when they did notify them, they failed to share all of the information at their disposal.\n\nLast week, he said: \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has been impacted disproportionately by the disease, with almost one quarter of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infections and deaths being seen in America. So far, more than 4.59 million people have tested positive for the disease globally and at least 309,000 have died according to official numbers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 although the real death toll is widely believed to be far higher.\n\nPresident Trump has said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery disappointed in China\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that he has no desire to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIntelligence reports show China acted irresponsibly\n\nA report from the department of Homeland Security shows that American officials believe that China intentionally covered up how severe the pandemic was in early January while hoarding medical supplies. Meanwhile, a leaked dossier by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance outlines how Beijing has caused some whistleblowers to mysteriously \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisappear\u00e2\u0080\u009d and scrubbed mentions of the disease in its early stages from the internet while destroying virus samples. They called their actions an \u00e2\u0080\u009cassault on international transparency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOther intelligence agencies have reached similar findings. For example, Der Spiegel reported on a German intelligence document that suggests the Chinese president personally pressured the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, into holding back info about human-to-human transmission and delaying a pandemic warning.\n\nIn fact, Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Federal Intelligence Service estimated that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions \u00e2\u0080\u009clost four to six weeks to fight the virus worldwide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIs it any surprise that the majority of Americans view China negatively and have no confidence in President Xi?\n\nWe already knew that China destroyed those samples, so admitting to doing so and making up an excuse for it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to do much to make them look any better. In fact, it will only add fuel to the rumors of coverups that are going on in the country, including those surrounding how this disease came into existence in the first place.

Between 4.6 to 5.5 million people could be hospitalised under this scenario, severely straining limited health resources.\n\nNearly 250 million people could catch the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 aka SARS-CoV-2) across the African continent, with up to 190,000 of them dying if African countries don\u2019t receive the support that they require. This is according to the latest peer-reviewed report by experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), due to be published soon in the British Medical Journal.\n\nDr Humphrey Karamagi is the Team Leader for Data, Analytics and Knowledge Management in the WHO Regional Office for Africa and co-authored this latest report.\n\nSputnik: How will non-African countries be affected if the African continent doesn't get the support it requires to avoid the worst-case scenario that your model predicts?\n\nDr Humphrey Karamagi: All countries of the world will be affected negatively. At present, WHO has said it anticipates the virus would be around the globe for a few years.\n\nAfrica may become a source of new infections for other regions of the world, just as other regions may be a source of new infections for Africa. The support to the African countries therefore needs to be part of the overall global response for all countries.\n\nSputnik: Your report says that previous predictive models have failed to adequately reflect the socio-ecological factors which are unique to many African countries.\n\nWhat is different about your model that results in a more fair and accurate prediction of what we can expect to occur in Africa?\n\nDr Humphrey Karamagi: First, it takes into consideration new information about the epidemiology of SARS-Cov_2 infection, which the other models may not have had.\n\nSecond, it incorporates the information on how the infection interacts in the body to cause severe disease, particularly in relation to the elderly, and people with obesity, diabetes or are on hypertension management.\n\nThird, it captures a wider range of socio-ecological factors influencing transmission, all of which country specific data is used to build country-specific models of transmission.\n\nSputnik: What must be done to avoid the worst-case scenarios of healthcare systems being overstretched due to the COVID-19 outbreak?\n\nDr Humphrey Karamagi: Effective public health measures focusing on the need to test, isolate, treat and quarantine suspected cases. The aim is to interrupt transmission enough to reduce the risk of infection to a level where a country can effectively respond to the cases its health system can manage. This will avoid unnecessary deaths and costs.\n\nSputnik: The African continent appears to have suffered less from COVID-19 compared to Europe, the US and parts of Latin America thus far.\n\nWhy is that? Could it be that a lack of sufficient testing is hiding the true figures of those who have contracted the virus?\n\nDr Humphrey Karamagi: There are a number of potential explanations:\n\nFirst, it could be that Africa is still at the early phase of the pandemic that Europe and America went through given its lower rate of transmission postulated from the model. Cases are now increasing in countries where public health containment measures are not effective and reducing in countries where they are (like Mauritius, Eritrea).\n\nSecondly, levels of testing are very low in some countries and many cases may not be detected. As seen in the rest of the world, it is important to have expansive testing in order to identify and respond to cases.\n\nSputnik: Is your model open source and can its assumptions and data can be scrutinised and evaluated?\n\nDr Humphrey Karamagi: Obviously it is, and has even been peer reviewed by independent experts. All countries have received and are using it through the WHO Country Offices.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1674,"url":"https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/business\/autos\/2020\/05\/21\/tesla-offers-anxious-plant-workers-unpaid-leave-may-coronavirus-fears\/111837808\/","publisher":"The Detroit News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":[],"title":"Tesla offers anxious plant workers unpaid leave until May 31","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/21\/PDTN\/69a7378c-88d3-4c4e-a21b-8c9393f1f163-AP20130680460303.jpg?crop=5300,2981,x0,y269&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds","body_text":"Tesla Inc. will give workers at its U.S. car and battery plants the ability to take unpaid leave through the end of the month if they\u2019re wary of returning to work, according to an internal memo.\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker announced the provision along with plans to reinstate its attendance policy starting Friday.

The buoyed reserve that has resulted has now a point of pride for the administration. The president has called himself the \u201cking of ventilators\u201d and plans to send some of the expensive machines to other countries facing shortages. The Rawsonville plant has promised to manufacture 50,000 ventilators by July 4.\n\nYet the visit was not without controversy.\n\nIn the days leading up to it, questions were raised about whether or not the president would wear a mask while touring the facility, as the Ford plant requires for safety reasons. Trump previously opted to not wear a mask during a visit last week to the medical equipment factory in Pennsylvania.\n\nFord initially released a statement saying the plant notified the White House of its mask requirement, then later clarified the decision would be left to the White House. Michigan\u2019s attorney general then wrote an open letter to the president saying it was his \u201clegal responsibility\u201d to wear a protective face covering, given current state orders.\n\n\u201cI ask that while you are on tour you respect the great efforts of the men and women at Ford \u2014 and across this state \u2014 by wearing a facial covering,\u201d wrote Attorney General Dana Nessel.\n\nOn Thursday, Ford issued a statement saying CEO Bill Ford \"encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived,\" and that the president complied \"during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.\u201d\n\nThe president also lobbed political grenades at Michigan\u2019s Democratic leaders earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from Michigan after accusing the state, without evidence, of \u201cillegally\u201d sending absentee ballots to voters.\n\n\u201cThis was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!\u201d\n\nLater, he corrected his tweet \u2014 the state is sending only applications for absentee ballots, not actual ballots \u2014 and said it might not be necessary to withhold any funds. But he still expressed anger over the state\u2019s strategy on Thursday, claiming without evidence at several points that it would lead to fraud.\n\n\u201cWe don't want anyone to do mail-in ballots,\u201d he said before departing the White House. \u201cNow, if someone has to mail it in because they're sick or by the way because they live in the White House and they have to vote on Florida, and they won't be in Florida and there's a reasoning for it, that's OK.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s visit also comes at a fraught time for the state as Midland County, located north of Detroit, faces catastrophic flooding that has forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Trump\u2019s schedule did not include a visit to the devastated area. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was not invited to meet the president while he was on the ground in Michigan.\n\nTrump on Thursday offered assurances that the federal government would support the local recovery, including with Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1678,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/05\/21\/georgia-reopening-coronavirus-jobs-273070","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Megan Cassella']","title":"Reopening reality check: Georgia's jobs aren\u2019t flooding back","image":"https:\/\/static.politico.com\/e3\/3c\/949e29c84de1bc5a78a8443030b7\/apga.jpg","body_text":"There are many reasons Georgia\u2019s jobless numbers are still going up, economists say, including that the state, like most of the country, is still whittling through a backlog of applications. State officials also say some laid-off workers are filing duplicate claims, which can artificially inflate the numbers. But the data still underscores how lifting stay-at-home restrictions alone will do little to bring jobs and spending back unless consumer confidence improves, bringing demand with it.\n\n\u201cThink of a restaurant: They\u2019re not going to be able to bring back their entire staff because they\u2019re just not going to have the clientele,\u201d said Laura Wheeler, associate director of the Center for State and Local Finance at Georgia State University. \u201cThat\u2019s going to hinder the return of the workforce, because while we\u2019re going to open up, we\u2019re not going to open up to the full capacity that we were at before.\u201d\n\nAnd in Georgia, public polling indicates that confidence has yet to return. Nearly two-thirds of Georgia residents in a recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll said they felt their state was lifting restrictions too quickly, and only 39 percent said they approved of Kemp\u2019s handling of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been chasing a bit of a false narrative that the economic hit is about the restrictions and not the disease itself,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president and founder of Macropolicy Perspectives, an economic research consulting firm. \u201cThe economic story really isn\u2019t about lockdowns, and we\u2019re going to make mistakes by pursuing that narrative. It really is about the disease, and how fearful people are about getting sick, and how businesses are going to operate in a world where this virus is with us.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration is pushing to get governors to reopen their doors in the hopes that doing so will help revive the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump has amplified calls to \u201cliberate\u201d states and criticized governors he feels are moving too cautiously, often accusing Democratic leaders of playing politics. \u201cYou have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they want to keep them closed,\u201d he said during a visit to the state last week, a hit to Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. \u201cCan't do that.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, The White House is also closely watching state-level claims data and expects reopening to have a major effect, Kevin Hassett, a senior economic adviser to the president, said late last week. \u201cMy fear is that the places that stay closed could have sort of skyrocketing claims,\u201d Hassett told reporters at the White House, adding: \u201cThe places that are turning on could actually see claims go way back down towards normal.\u201d\n\nBut many economists dispute the idea that lifting restrictions will by itself mean a major boost to the labor market, in part because of evidence that layoffs accelerated in March separate from governors\u2019 shutdown restrictions. A recent analysis by four University of California-Berkeley researchers found that the direct effect of stay-at-home orders accounted for only one-quarter of the jobless claims at the start of the crisis \u2014 suggesting that a majority of jobs that have been erased would have been lost even without statewide shutdowns.\n\nA drop-off in consumer demand, disruptions to global supply chains and self-imposed social distancing measures all exacerbated the job losses and will likely continue to hinder the economic recovery after shutdown restrictions are removed.\n\nPOLITICO compared nine weeks of non-seasonally-adjusted initial jobless claims to Georgia\u2019s non-adjusted residential employment from February to determine the state\u2019s jobless claims rate of 40.3 percent, which is currently the highest in the country.\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The state did change its criteria early on to require employers to file unemployment claims on behalf of their employees in many situations, a move that supporters say simplifies the process and allows for quicker payouts. The state also now allows workers to earn as much as $300 each week without having their unemployment eligibility affected.\n\nOthers speculated that Georgia might employ more workers in industries like hospitality and healthcare that have been deeply affected, or that many residents are employed by small businesses that have struggled to survive during the pandemic.\n\nBut no matter the reasons, experts say the data offers an early indication of why millions of jobs across the country that were erased in mere weeks could take years to return.\n\n\u201cReopening is certainly not a lights-on, lights-off situation,\u201d said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \u201cThese are companies that have seen a shock in their demand, and at a certain point, they can\u2019t keep their workers on.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1681,"url":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/21\/coronavirus-jolted-finances-may-be-worse-than-feared-la-officials-say\/","publisher":"Los Angeles Daily News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['City News Service']","title":"Coronavirus-jolted finances may be worse than feared, LA officials say","image":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LDN-L-LIGHTITBLUE-0507-KB2-5.jpg?w=1024&h=621","body_text":"By ERIC HEINZ, City News Service\n\nLos Angeles may find itself in a worse financial situation than envisioned in the mayor\u2019s proposed budget for the next fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, city officials said Thursdsay, May 21.\n\nAccording to Chief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, the city\u2019s Office of Finance is anticipating 2021 tax revenues will be a minimum of $45 million short of Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s proposed budget and could fall short by as much as $400 million, depending upon how quickly the economy recovers.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that we are going to be facing a difficult fiscal year,\u201d Council President Nury Martinez said. \u201cBut even in difficult years, this council has delivered by focusing on the most vulnerable communities in our city. As we start the new fiscal year, it is important to keep in mind the people who need us the most right now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Los Angeles has been using financial tactics to pay for essential materials to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the lagging economy may not catch up fast enough before the city is forced to further dip into its reserves.\n\nCouncilman Paul Krekorian, the council\u2019s Budget and Finance Committee chair, said that although tax returns for May have not been calculated, the city\u2019s sales tax revenues were down 10% in March and 17% in April compared to last year, and the city\u2019s hotel tax revenues were down 11% in March and 77% in April.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that this is only going to get worse from here and that we\u2019re going to be faced with even more difficult choices,\u201d Councilman Bob Blumenfield said.\n\nThe budget process for Los Angeles will continue through June, as the city looks for ways to brace for the financial effects of COVID-19.\n\nThe Budget and Finance Committee is planning to meet June 8, 15, 22 and 29 to examine the budget, but Krekorian said it\u2019s not possible to examine each department\u2019s finances at great length this year.\n\n\u201cEven if we had considered all of those lengthy hearings that we typically have, the truth is the level of uncertainty over all of the assumptions that we rely on for our budget is greater now than it has ever been, probably in the city\u2019s history,\u201d Krekorian said.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 entire budget is proposed to be about $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, with an operating general fund of about $6.6 billion.\n\nLos Angeles has already spent $155 million in special fund loans on personal protective equipment and other COVID-19 preventions, but much of those funds could be reimbursed through Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.\n\nMuch of the funding for loans is coming from the Department of Building and Safety, and those loans have interest attached to them and must be repaid eventually.\n\nAnother $82 million from various funding sources has been used to cover COVID-19 testing kits, senior meals, small business micro loans and other programs.\n\nCOVID-19 testing has taken up more than half of those expenses at $43 million, and city officials said they\u2019re trying to have the county take over its testing sites, as it may receive federal funding to do so.\n\nLos Angeles estimates it will receive about $694 million in federal coronavirus relief, but those funds can be used only for responding to the virus and have to be spent by the end of 2020.\n\nThe funds cannot be used to replenish revenues the city anticipated it would have received prior to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe really need to spend those dollars on COVID-specific responses within that time frame,\u201d said Matthew Szabo, Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\n\nBut the city has already had to dip into its reserves, which have fallen from a \u201crobust\u201d 8.5% of the general fund, about $407 million, and will likely be down to 3.6%, or $243 million, by the start of the next fiscal year. City Administrative Officer Richard Llewellyn said the reserves are \u201cdangerously low.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles was facing difficult budget decisions prior to the pandemic related to pay raises and contracts with public safety departments, which make up most of the city\u2019s operating budget.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s budget for this year was about $1.73 billion, and next year it is expected to be increase to $1.85 billion.\n\nPublic speakers said Wednesday and Thursday they opposed the proposal to increase the LAPD budget, contending that the money should be used for housing and COVID-19 prevention efforts.\n\nCouncilman Mike Bonin asked if there was a way to defer pay raises in response to the pandemic. Neither the LAPD nor Los Angeles Fire Department budgets are in line to see decreases compared to this year.\n\nLlewellyn said he did not want to discuss labor negotiations in a public setting, but \u201ceverything is on the table.\u201d\n\nSome notable services that are expected to be reduced include capital improvement projects, graffiti abatement, tree services, animal sterilization and the mayor\u2019s Gang Reeducation and Youth Development program.\n\n\u201cOur effort here \u2026 was to not cut entirely or eliminate any particular portion of a department or a program, but to try to manage the reductions across the city,\u201d Szabo said.\n\nThe city has enacted a hiring freeze, estimated to save $42 million next year, and it plans to furlough 15,000 of its civilian employees for 26 days next year to save $139 million.\n\nCouncilman David Ryu said as the city considers the budget, it should not make cuts to services that help homeless people, the elderly, victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cIf we make cuts to departments and services that serve low-income and working families, we will be paying for those cuts for decades to come,\u201d Ryu said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1682,"url":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/21\/la-supervisors-want-inspector-general-to-oversee-skilled-nursing-facilities-in-wake-of-covid-19\/","publisher":"Los Angeles Daily News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['City News Service']","title":"LA supervisors want inspector general to oversee skilled nursing facilities in wake of coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/PAS-L-VIRUS-JASMIN-0514-02-SRA-2.jpg?w=1024&h=683","body_text":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger will ask the board to appoint an inspector general to oversee skilled nursing facilities, which account for more than half of all deaths from COVID-19 in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe motion also calls for bringing in the county\u2019s auditor-controller to ensure closer monitoring of skilled nursing facilities immediately. The inspector general would be tasked with developing recommendations on how to strengthen oversight for skilled nursing facilities, and how to improve their operations long-term, according to a statement.\n\nMany skilled nursing homes get low marks for quality of care, patient satisfaction, and employee pay, the statement noted.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors will vote on the motion at their next meeting on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhile some skilled nursing homes may be doing their best to respond to COVID-19, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of deaths at these facilities, tragically exposing the urgent need for stronger oversight across the industry,\u201d Ridley-Thomas said. \u201cNow, more than ever, we must act to address any questionable operations and substandard conditions in the facilities that care for some of our most vulnerable residents \u2014 the elderly, the low-income and the disabled.\u201d\n\nBarger added: \u201cSkilled nursing facilities provide critical care and support for many of our most vulnerable populations. As the County fights the COVID-19 public health crisis, we must greatly improve our ability to assess and oversee these facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of all those who have been entrusted to their care.\u201d\n\nSkilled nursing facilities, which serve thousands of residents who tend to be older and medically fragile, have become the epicenter of L.A. County\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 18, 4,794 residents and 2,918 staff from these facilities have tested positive for the virus. Across L.A. County, 52 percent of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in institutional settings, particularly in skilled nursing facilities.\n\nThe L.A. County Department of Health Services director, Dr. Christina Ghaly, said that \u201cIt is our collective responsibility to protect and support the most vulnerable among us. Prioritizing the health and safety of those in our County\u2019s skilled nursing facilities is the right thing to do and will also help protect the availability of hospital resources for all those who need them.\u201d\n\nThe Ridley-Thomas\/Barger motion says it is \u201ccritical that L.A. County learn the lessons of this crisis; identify the internal and external factors that have contributed to inadequate conditions within skilled nursing facilities; and provide oversight, accountability and resources as needed.\u201d\n\nThey described the proposed inspector general as a \u2018much-needed accountability measure\u201d appointed to conduct an exhaustive review of L.A. County\u2019s capacity to regulate skilled nursing facilities, recommend structural and operational changes, and outline a plan for ensuring adequate and sustainable oversight. They also plan to task the inspector general with recommending regulatory and policy improvements at the local, state and federal levels to enhance quality of care, ensuring adequate infection control measures, and supporting healthcare workers.\n\nTo increase transparency, the Ridley-Thomas\/Barger motion also called for directing the L.A. County auditor-controller to take the lead in designing a publicly accessible dashboard with information about COVID-19 case totals, testing frequency, mitigation plan status, and other information. The motion seeks to find ways to enhance L.A. County\u2019s ability to assess the adequacy of mitigation plans and to oversee their implementation.\n\nSkilled nursing facilities have also received close attention from L.A. City government. Under an emergency order issued Friday by Mayor Eric Garcetti, skilled nursing facilities in Los Angeles will be required to provide diagnostic testing for COVID-19 for their employees, residents and contractors.\n\nNursing facilities, senior living homes and other facilities that care for people 65 and older have been potential \u201cdeath traps,\u201d Garcetti said.\n\nGarcetti said the facilities can request assistance with testing from the city\u2019s Emergency Operations Center if they\u2019re unable to obtain it themselves.

For example:\n\nThe county must meet one of these goals that show hospitalizations have stabilized:\n\nThe number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized each day can\u2019t go up by more than 5%, averaged over seven days.\n\nOr, there can be no more than 20 COVID-19 hospitalizations on any single day during a 14-day period. (This is meant for smaller counties.)\n\nIt also must meet one of these goals related to confirmed cases:\n\nFewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days, or\n\nLess than 8% of all people whose test results came back in the past seven days were positive.\n\nAnd it must achieve this goal related to testing:\n\nA minimum daily testing volume of 1.5 people tested per 1,000 residents per day, averaged over seven days.\n\nOther benchmarks include creating a plan for contract tracing and the workforce capacity for the effort; providing proof that it enough availability temporary housing units to shelter at least 15% of its homeless; securing a strategy for protecting vulnerable communities, such as people in nursing homes; delivering a timeline for opening all the categories of businesses in Phase 2; and doing the math to show the metrics that would use to measure if it\u2019s time re-tighten restrictions.\n\nIn attesting to meeting the benchmarks, Ventura County Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin noted that the average number of patients hospitalized had fallen by 3.4% over seven days ending on May 16; that the cumulative incidence rate over 14 days was at 16.6 per 100,000 residents and that it\u2019s testing capacity \u2014 at 1,360 tests per day \u2014 remains well above the bencmark of 1,280 tests per day. The county\u2019s volume had not matched its capacity because the Safer-at-Home order has kept the number of symptomatic people needing testing low. But the county was able to show a plan to increase testing, including surveillance testing of vulnerable populations. That will help the county meet the state\u2019s required volume, according to Ventura officials.\n\nVentura County joins 38 of the state\u2019s 58 counties aiming to move forward quickly in what is called Accelerated Phase 2 of a 4-phase process to ease restrictions that have shut down economies in the effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. That effort has worked to flatten the curve, public health officials say. But it\u2019s also devastated local economies and government budgets, prompting renewed efforts to re-open sooner in areas where that can happen.\n\nMoving further down Stage 2 allows for counties to open up \u201cdestination retail (retail stores), including shopping malls and swap meets; dine-in restaurants (other amenities, like bars or gaming areas, are not permitted in Stage 2); and schools with modifications. All this, along with the already allowed curbside retail and other services, such as car washes and pet grooming.\n\nL.A. County \u2014 with its 10 million residents \u2014 includes nearly 50% of the state\u2019s cases and nearly 60% of its deaths. Nonetheless, it is making progress toward meeting Newsom\u2019s criteria:\n\nHospitalization: The county\u2019s rate hasn\u2019t just stabilized, it\u2019s been trending down \u2014 from 1,742 people on May 14 to 1,516 people on May 21. That comes to a daily average of -1.6%, well under the benchmark.\n\nConfirmed cases: L.A. County would have to drop below 2,543 new cases in two weeks to meet this criteria through the first option \u2014 five times lower than its current two-week total. But it can meet the criteria through the second option \u2014 only about 5% of test results the county has received in the past week have been positive.\n\nL.A. County needs to average 15,259 tests per day to meet this. Just this week, it has started hitting that target \u2014 it\u2019s gotten results back for an average of 18,714 tests in the past seven days, officials have said.\n\nCounty officials say they are trying to balance the urgency to re-open the region\u2019s economy while also sticking to public health goals to avoid a resurgence in the disease.\n\nIn Ventura, officials will start by opening with dine-in restaurants and in-store shopping, which must observe social distancing orders. Destination shopping, such as malls, will not immediately open, according to the county\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cWith reopening and more Ventura County residents coming into contact with one another, we are concerned that cases of COVID-19 may increase, along with hospitalizations, and even deaths,\u201d Ventura officials\u2019 opening plan notes.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1691,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/latam\/202005211079373850-maduro-accuses-colombian-president-of-ordering-to-infect-venezuela-with-coronavirus-report\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":[],"title":"Maduro Accuses Colombian President of Ordering to 'Infect' Venezuela With Coronavirus - Report","image":"https:\/\/cdn2.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107937\/35\/1079373581.jpg","body_text":"In the mid-March, Venezuela declared a state of emergency in the country due to the spread of coronavirus; so far, the country has registered only 824 cases of the infection and 10 deaths.

Venezuela rushed to immediately declare a national state of emergency and introduce quarantine measures across the country to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nVenezuelan authorities say that out of all the registered cases, 44% were reported over the last five days.

Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\" -- The Red Queen in \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d\n\nIn the spirit of Her Majesty, here are six impossible things about the coronavirus Democrats and the media want you to believe, as well as an explanation of why each is absurd.\n\n1. China bears no responsibility for this pandemic \u2013 All the Chi-coms did was to deny the possibility of human-to-human transmission for as long as they could, destroy or remove tissue samples from the Wuhan lab, allow travel outside China (while banning it within the country), force physicians and researchers who tried to alert us to the danger early on to recant (they made one disappear) and stockpile medical supplies while refusing to admit there was a problem. Other than that, not much.\n\n2. COVID-19 doesn\u2019t discriminate: Old and young, sick and well \u2013 all are equally susceptible \u2013 You might as well say that an octogenarian is as likely to injure himself skateboarding as a 16-year-old. In Pennsylvania, the median age of death from COVID-19 is 84 years. Overall, the probability of death from the virus in the United States is 1.5 in 10,000. But for those under 55 who are healthy, it\u2019s 1.5 in 100,000. In 14 states that report these statistics, nursing homes accounted for half of all coronavirus deaths. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule \u2013 which the media love to play up. But, overwhelmingly, the victims are elderly, with a pre-existing condition.\n\n3. This epidemic is like a war. Some civil liberties have to be temporarily suspended as a matter of national survival. \u2013 In the name of combating the coronavirus, Americans have been denied freedom to work, freedom of movement, freedom of religion (with houses of worship closed) and freedom of speech. Protests are permitted, as long as there aren\u2019t more than 10 people and everyone is wearing face masks and standing at least 6 feet apart. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he wasn\u2019t thinking about the Bill of Rights when implementing social-distancing guidelines. No kidding.\n\n4. Social distancing and face masks work \u2013 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was \u201cshocked\u201d to discover recently that 66% of new coronavirus hospitalizations were among people \u201clargely sheltering at home.\u201d Proximity of one person to another has little to do with the spread of the disease, nor do the sacred face masks stop transmission. Both are largely symbolic as well as a form of virtue-flashing. When the virus first reached our shores, the experts told us that face masks were useless, unless you\u2019re a medical professional using the type of masks not available to the general public. Now we\u2019re told we must wear them \u2013 even if they\u2019re makeshift. There\u2019s no science behind this. They\u2019re meant to assure us that politicians are doing all they can to keep us safe. Then, when fatalities decline, which happens in the normal course of any epidemic, they\u2019ll demand that we thank them for saving us.\n\n5. Damage to the economy is the price we have to pay to stop a deadly contagion. That\u2019s easy to say if you work for government \u2013 which is now our only growth industry. While the coronavirus regimen that statists adore has done little, if anything, to halt the spread of the disease, it\u2019s put our economy in the ICU. We lost 870,000 jobs in March and 20.5 million in April. The Wall Street Journal notes that this is the fastest economic collapse in our history \u2013 all so governors would have another opportunity to play big brother and bring us closer to the Democratic utopia. No one asked unemployed auto workers or the depressed who are out of work and can\u2019t afford the co-pay on their meds if they were willing to pay the price.\n\n6. The shutdown doesn\u2019t favor one party or the other\u2013 In fact, it\u2019s a gift from heaven for Democrats. They\u2019re using the shutdown to destroy the Trump economy and push a bailout of bankrupt blue states. They\u2019re also using the virus to get mail-in ballots, increasing the opportunities for voter fraud, the sine qua non of the Democratic party. The governors fighting hardest to maintain the status quo -- Cuomo, Wolf, Pritzker, Northam and Newson, among others \u2013 are Democrats, as are their congressional allies, Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer. Why \u2013 because they\u2019re dedicated public health or partisan politics?\n\nIt\u2019s just possible that supporters of the shutdown want to make America look more like China.

During the same period, Soros added 1.7 million shares to his holdings of Alberta-based energy company Cenovus Energy (with total shares now worth $7 million+, and NiSource, Inc, a gas and electricity holding company operating across seven US states, with total investments of over $6.7 million. Overall, the string of share buys is expected to net Soros Fund Management between 3 and 11.5 percent dividends in the coming months, not a bad deal considering most of the world\u2019s central banks have switched to sub-zero bond rates in recent months. In addition to the above-mentioned operations, Soros\u2019 hedge fund has also been busy buying, selling, adding, dumping, and researching dozens more companies in operations worth hundreds of millions of dollars during the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2020 \/ Brendan Smialowski George Soros, Chairman of Soros Fund Management\n\nThen there\u2019s Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, already the wealthiest man alive, who has reportedly added another $25 billion to his fortune since the start of 2020 as coronavirus lockdowns have led millions of Americans to turn to Amazon for entertainment and sustenance, and the stock price of his company to grow accordingly. Amid skyrocketing revenues of $75.5 billion in Q1 2020 (up from $59.7 billion a year earlier), business media have been speculating that, if current trends continue, Bezos could become the world\u2019s first trillionaire sometime in the next decade. So fantastical is Bezos\u2019 Midas touch of profit-making that even his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos, who became the third richest woman in the world after divorcing him in 2019 with a $35 billion settlement, that her wealth too has reportedly grown by $8.6 billion over the past four months alone.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo \/ Cliff Owen Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, laughs as he speaks at The Economic Club of Washington's Milestone Celebration in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018\n\nElon Musk, the eccentric Tesla and SpaceX CEO and tech billionaire who has intrigued netizens in recent weeks with obscure tweets casting doubt about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic, accusing governments of \u2018fascist\u2019 restrictions and suggesting that the stock price of his own company is \u201ctoo high,\u201d has nevertheless managed to stay in the black, netting some $5 billion in new wealth, also mostly through stock gains, even as he promised to sell off all his real estate and almost all of his physical possessions to devote time to loftier goals including Mars exploration.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo \/ Chris Carlson SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk speaks after announcing Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as the first private passenger on a trip around the moon, Monday, Sept. 17, 2018, in Hawthorne, Calif.\n\nWho Will Be the Next Multibillionaire? As the coronavirus crisis continues to wreak havoc on global health care systems and the world economy, biotech companies around the world are rushing to develop a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Kalorama Information, a New York-based market analytics firm, estimates that there are over 75 vaccine candidates around the world, five of them already undergoing clinical trials. Needless to say, whoever wins the \u2018race\u2019 to the vaccine will have the best chance of raking in the big bucks, as governments will begin buying up billions of doses for immunization programmes. Kalorama says based on previous experience with influenza vaccines, which generated $5.2 billion in revenues in 2018, COVID-19 could generate between $8 billion and $10 billion dollars in demand in the first full year of implementation alone. Among the major candidates are CanSino Biologics, a Chinese vaccine company already engaged in human trials, US biotech company Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals (the company supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), and the Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, another Chinese entity which is working on two separate coronavirus-related vaccine preparations.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1718,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/radio_the_critical_hour\/202005221079394596-a-synopsis-of-the-us-taiwan-relationship-as-weapon-sales-fuel-tension-with-china\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Wilmer Leon']","title":"A Synopsis of the US-Taiwan Relationship as Weapon Sales Fuel Tension With China","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107839\/95\/1078399546.jpg","body_text":"A Synopsis of the US-Taiwan Relationship as Weapon Sales Fuel Tension With China\n\nOn this episode of The Critical Hour, Dr. Wilmer Leon is joined by Caleb Maupin, journalist and political analyst who focuses his coverage on US foreign policy.\n\nIt's Friday: that means it's panel time!\n\n\"The US State Department has approved a possible sale to Taiwan of 18 MK-48 Mod6 advanced technology heavyweight torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated cost of $180 million, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on Wednesday,\" Reuters reported Wednesday.

This message is likely to be relevant in the 2020 US presidential campaign. \"The White House salvos have sought to keep a focus on China's early response to the virus and what Trump has called a 'China-centric' deference at the World Health Organization.

Schools, factories, offices, and other businesses remain shuttered. The Trump administration has promised to provide $1,200 to every citizen, but it will be months before everyone receives their check. As a result, there has been an explosion in the use of food banks, as desperate citizens line up for hours in the hopes of receiving a box of food.\"\n\n\"The US has rejected wording in a World Health Organization resolution that backs the right of poor countries to ignore patents in order to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment,\" the Financial Times reported this week. \"Washington dissociated itself Tuesday from elements of a motion passed by WHO members, saying that it sent 'the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs.'

How likely is it that the US will permanently freeze its funding to WHO?\n\nDon Debar: It's quite possible that they will not just freeze it, even roll it back. You know, there are several things at play around this question. First is that Trump's base, the core Republican voters have always had an antipathy towards the United Nations and, you know, the institutions of the United Nations, the World Health Organization is, of course, you know, one of the children of the United Nations. And even back in the 50s, they loved candidates that were running on the Republican Party platform, (calling for the White House to) get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.\n\nSo there is a latent sentiment in that direction that he's playing to the base on. And so you have to take with that grain of salt - him saying this is an opportunity for him to do some U.N. bashing in coded language to some core part of his constituency, the Republican Party constituency.\n\nBut that said, this also comes in the midst of his ongoing trade dispute. You know, the renegotiation essentially of the economic relations between the United States and China. And that's been a project of the Trump administration's, you know, from the beginning. They announce they were going to do. The trade situation was unfavourable to the United States, that the employment situation was completely destroyed in the United States and this was all going to be remedied with hard negotiations with China.\n\nWell, you know, this virus epidemic or a pandemic has provided a perfect opportunity for him to China bash that he\u2019s taken full advantage of. When he's taking full advantage of, he's blaming this entire megillah on China, on their being secretive, on their being incompetent, on just how you should have been played better with us. And so as he's having negotiations with China saying, I want you to drop this tariff and, you know, renegotiate that. He's also screaming in the public sphere, you know, things that China would probably prefer, he said. Right. Look, I'll go. What do you want us to stop? What do you want? What do you want? No, this a negotiation tactic. And it's that's got to be looked at in that context as well.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2020 \/ FABRICE COFFRINI World Health Organisation (WHO) headquarter, in Geneva, Switzerland\n\nNow, this was the World Health Organization itself goes. It was a journalist, for example, an international journalist knows that the U.N.'s. It may be the best organization of its kind available right now, but it is far from ideal or perfect.\n\nAnd certainly its governance and operation are a reflection of various power of various elites around the world and particularly Western imperialism, United States. If you deal with the media operation at the UN as I know you do and I do. You know that a speech by the foreign Minister of Iran at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Even if he does it in English, which he's done plenty of times, it will not appear in the media, for a download that afternoon or that news cycle or for 10 days, if ever, whereas the slightest utterance from whichever knucklehead the United States has as a permanent representative at the time, will go out exactly like that.\n\nAnd Trump mentions this in a way at his press conference yesterday saying, you know, the United States spends $450 million towards the WHO budget. And China spends $40 million towards their budget, maybe i\u2019ll cut this back. We're talking about being way out of scale in terms of operations.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS \/ LEAH MILLIS U.S. President Donald Trump talks with Will Guidara of the Independent Restaurant Coalition, and his economic advisor Larry Kudlow at the conclusion of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic meeting with restaurant executives and industry leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 18, 2020.\n\nNow if they're not responding to what Trump wants, however, we have to understand that Trump's power - and elite and state power of the United States - are not the same. People that are in the operating elite, of the officer class, or whatever, at the United Nations, the officials, those are people that are there as part of what they call the deep state. Those are people that were appointed over the years, part of a permanent bureaucracy. They are vetted through the EU, through Congress, through State Department, through the World Bank, through IMF, all these different institutions.\n\nAnd so it's quite possible that although the WHO was not doing what Trump would like, it doesn't necessarily mean it is doing the right thing either. It may well be being used or he perceives it as being used as just another agent of the people that would like to get him out of office.\n\n(For example) \u201cI would like to point out basically, you know, what, this insight we found today this entire disease came off of a culture from a napkin that was found in that hotel room from Trump's dossier. And that's the original source. And then they dropped that off in a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown in New York when Trump was still living in New York. And that's where this disease came from, it\u2019s Trump's fault.\u201d\n\nAnd there are some folks probably trying to figure out that kind of a narrative or that angle and there they are because they were put there by the Clinton or Bush or, you know, some other person over the years.\n\nSo the point is still down to this one. People have to not look at the World Health Organization as if it's an honest broker. This is not this is a self-interested group like any other and is very closely aligned with the elites of Western Europe, the United States and Japan.\n\nSecondly, Trump has to pitch this whole feud with international institutions to his base. And there's an element of that going on in there.\n\nAnd finally I think that we have to also consider the possibility that whatever is happening, we're going to have to construct something entirely different to respond in the future, because no matter pointing the finger at anyone, everyone has failed thus far.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS \/ Dado Ruvic Small bottles labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe are seen in this illustration taken taken April 10, 2020\n\nThis is the 21st century. So some virus that appears either in cattle in Omaha or somewhere in room on China or wherever it came from, should not spread around the world and bring death with it without us having at least enough masks and ventilators to deal with the outcome, let alone a responsive health care system that could identify this and give us in the 21st century already vaccines and whatever solutions there are in biology because they're there. And if we don't have them yet, it's because we've been spending money on missiles and bombs and wars instead of medicine.\n\nSputnik: How reasonable is it to leave WHO during a critical global pandemic? How timely is this measure?\n\nDon Debar: Well, having a feud with the World Health Organization at a different time would mean nothing. There'd be no attention paid to it. So in a way, as you know, counterintuitive as it seems, this is exactly the time to have this conversation because people are paying attention to it. And again, one has to consider not just who do people think the World Health Organization is, but what, in fact, is the World Health Organization.\n\nNow, there was a very interesting discussion of some of these points that President Xi Jinping had on Monday at the opening of the World Health Assembly. And I suggest that people take a listen to that \u2013 it\u2019s from 10 to 15 minutes long. And he detailed a lot of this. But now we have to we have to we should be looking at not just, you know, how is this good or bad to be doing this to the WHO right now. But what is it that we lack that we need to get? There's a larger question. So, you know, either we enhance the World Health Organization, that's fine. If we correct some of the problems or you know, or we scrap it, that's fine, too, if we put something else there. But we need to have infrastructure to deal with these kinds of things and it has to work better than this has worked so far.\n\nSputnik: What role does the United States play in WHO as a whole? If they come out in the end, how will this affect the organisation?\n\nDon Debar: This is more like a business management question. If the United States is in World Health Organization, OK, and the United States is outside of World Health Organization and everything else is a constant. That's one question. And but, of course, that's not how things work in the real world. There are some functions that are performed by or through or in coordination with or under the supervision of the World Health Organization. That is possible because of the $450 million a year or whatever it is that the United States contributes to.\n\nPresumably, if the U.S. pulled out of that, that money would no longer be available. OK. Well, that been some of those things will no longer be performed by or with the WHO. Are they things that need to be performed. What would be doing it instead? What structures would arise. You know, instead, what other regrouping is of existing structures? How would people divide the labor basically, if the existing division of labor had to be scrapped because the US pulled out of the World Health Organization, or alternatively, if the U.S. pulls out and nothing changes then good, here's $450 million, we'll spend it on something else. Just go buy some penicillin or Band-Aids or whatever.\n\nAnd you have to look at the whole picture to answer to that question. And I don't think we have a picture of the whole picture yet. I think that what this pandemic, if nothing else, has shown us, there are huge holes in the global health system if there can even be one worthy of that name. You know, like a unitary human health system. And I think the questions ought to be, what do we need as a species to survive? What resources are available realistically that we can apply to that and how can we organize them?\n\nAnd then you come to the big question - by what process do we make these determinations that achieve this? I think we need to get on it, though, because we're living closer and closer to each other. It\u2019s more and more crowded. there's more and more cross contamination of societies. You go from China today to Manhattan and suddenly people are sneezing two days later, then somebody gets on a plane from San Francisco and goes to Beijing. You know, people in Wuhan are bleeding out of their eyes or something and we\u2019re all living closer together and there\u2019s questions over infrastructure and environment and we\u2019re going to be facing these kind of crises more and more and it\u2019s a crapshoot whether one of them comes through that has a 100% fatality rate or not before we get to dealing with it. So what are we spending money on right now that we could be spending money on to prevent that from happening instead?\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS \/ Kevin Lamarque U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 7, 2020\n\nSputnik: The United States under Donald Trump has the image of a country that has unilaterally withdrawn from many important treaties. How will this exit affect the image of the country and Trump himself?\n\nDon Debar: As somebody that comes out of a business that is transactional in nature, real estate. That stuff is basically you're sitting down and making dealmaking all the time. Transactional. Yeah. So what do you see? See an agreement for the first time that's been made by somebody else is, you know, what are the costs and benefits of this and can we get a better deal? And so he has and this, you know, he speaks in those terms, even when he looks at these things, the deal with Iran, we can get a better deal.\n\nThe deal was on the table with North Korea. We'll get a better deal. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Better deal. Better deal than the nuclear nonproliferation treaty reduction, whatever they need. Several things that they scrapped.\n\nBy the way, George Bush scrapped up the more important ones than what Trump scrapped.\n\nYou know, optics of this, all of that. And now would he be walking away from or renegotiating? And then what's his image? What image is he projecting? There are some agreements I would love to see him walk away from that he sort of threatened to do when he was running for office and got my attention. We're talking here about scrapping NATO, for example, looking at the military alliances in general and say, do we really need these in the 21st century? There's no longer a massive threat of a world war. We don't really have any big enemies. Do we need to be wasting all this money on all this stuff?\n\nNow, he had to revise that, but not fundamentally as he started to implement different things. Also, the newspapers are calling him a traitor. They're calling him an isolationist and all of this. So he sort of skated that way and actually spent more money on the military budgets than the others, although I think he sees them and he speaks of them as jobs bills.\n\n\u201cI'm not allowed to spend money any other place, but on weapons fine, buy weapons, at least somebody is going to get work.\u201d\n\nBut there's some other agreements that I'd like to see him walk away from. The JCPOA, I think. I don't think was a catastrophe that everybody makes it out to be except the catastrophe is that the sanctions have continued. But a long story short, as far as that goes, the agreements that he has abrogated, NAFTA, that he renegotiated - the ongoing negotiations with China over trade\u2026walking away from the TPP, a lot of those I think a lot of people were in favor of. And in fact, they are some of the reasons that he got elected. Those are not things that are popular with you know, the people who were the political elite for the 40 years prior to Trump but these are things that were popular with voters. Now they're not popular with the media. So the image that comes out of this is that he's just a wrecker.\n\nIf you come in there and you have a marriage, he\u2019ll wreck that. If you have a partnership on a little grocery store he\u2019ll wreck that, he's just a, you know, crazy anarchistic maniac. And if you have an agreement, he's going to break it. But that's an image that's being sold for in the media. It's because of the ongoing media antipathy towards him. But and also by a lot of the players. Iran, for example, should, you know, be angry with Trump and criticize Trump over him abrogating their agreement because they are actually materially suffering from sanctions that Trump and the U.S. government have put on. Although, you know, I point out that Congress passed sanctions against Iran all by itself without Trump and against Russia and North Korea, if we go back to 2017, 2018.\n\nBut between the thing itself, which is the abrogation of treaties and the image, I think there's a big difference. A lot of the things that he has renegotiated or abrogated should have been - not all, but some certainly a lot of them, like TPP.\n\nAnd the image, however, is something is being crafted by a third party, by the media and by, you know, just people that are on the other side of the table around the world. And that is what it is. It's an image. It\u2019s maybe the honest perception of some and a fair one. And for others, it's one, you know, is being peddled just like every other image that\u2019s being peddled.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1746,"url":"https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/coronavirus\/ct-coronavirus-chicago-lori-lightfoot-reopening-plan-phase-three-20200522-i77sxrpvcbby3hey4yhqu7a2pu-story.html","publisher":"Drudge Report","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Gregory Pratt', 'Bill Ruthhart']","title":"Chicago will cautiously reopen in early June, begin easing restrictions on some businesses and activities, Mayor Lori Lightfoot says","image":"https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/resizer\/lgt5H7YqWphfe2Q4I3PbDlZxo60=\/1200x0\/left\/middle\/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com\/tronc\/5HWJ6FBSBRG5HOKKNH3WPGLVKU.jpg","body_text":"\u201cI, too, would like everything to reopen in the fashion that it was before.

However, there are many things at stake in this initiative.\n\nA number of state officials from North Dakota, South Carolina and Alabama publicly praised an unprecedented collaboration between Google and Apple that will help them produce a contact-tracing app automatically notifying people whether they have spent time near someone who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThese US states and some countries have already signalled that they will be willing to use the app, while France, Norway and India have remained sceptical regarding the initiative, giving preference to a more centralised approach, that allows the storing up and uploading of data via Bluetooth to a remote server, thus allegedly making it easier for health authorities to contain the virus.\n\nSo far, the UK\u2019s NHS has been developing a contact tracing app built exactly using this approach, despite breach of privacy concerns and the possibility that this data will b overshared with the government. According to some reports, Britain is now also eyeing the integration of an Apple-Google API model to their app, but some fear that even a decentralised approach propelled by these two giants may not be as safe as initially suggested.\n\n\u201cIt is possible this technology may be abused to collect more information other than data related to the virus,\u201d says Fow Chee Kang, associate director and cyber security managing consultant at LGMS. \u201cAlthough the statement released by the tech giants highlights the features of protecting user privacy and security, nevertheless, there are still possibilities of using such technology in conjunction with existing data that is already in the mobile device to profile the user.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo \/ Martin Meissner The icons of Google, WhatsApp and YouTube are pictured on an iPhone on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany\n\nThe companies have indeed stated that the version of their COVID-tracing app would protect its users with the help of encryption, and lack a centralised database, with the process being carried out only through the phones themselves, which would prevent the unnecessary storage of private information. However, following several scandals involving Google over potential breaches of privacy, the company has openly stated its cooperation with the White House \u201cmay negatively impact the trust of users\u201d toward Apple as well, says Kang.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that there will be data being shared to the government about its user, hence, it may affect the trust of Apple customers in this sense,\u201d the expert notes.\n\nAccording to Matthew Hickey, cyber security expert and co-founder of Hacker House, contact tracing applications as such \u201chave been disputed by many as an unnecessary invasion of privacy,\u201d as he argues that even the creators of NHS\u2019s app \u201chave expressly stated that they wish to retain the collected data after the pandemic ends for future study\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis opens up the prospect that this data could also be abused in the future and will make it easier for similar track and trace programs to be implemented by governments around the world,\u201d Hickey argues. \u201cIt is my opinion that we should not sacrifice our personal privacy and liberty for a small amount of security from a Virus threat.\u201d\n\nThere still might be an option for those users who are \u201cconcerned about the privacy and security of any information collected from smartphone tracing apps\u201d, says associate professor at the School of Engineering at RMIT Mark A Gregory, which is \u201cto factory reset their phones after the pandemic.\u201d He does not specify, however, how to go about information that has already been collected by Google and Apple about its users.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1752,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/military\/202005221079382198-finnish-parliament-to-reproach-ministries-for-keeping-mum-about-nato-cooperation-deal--reports\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"Finnish Parliament to Reproach Ministries for Keeping Mum About NATO Cooperation Deal \u2013 Reports","image":"https:\/\/cdn2.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/103893\/66\/1038936639.jpg","body_text":"It took Finnish MPs two years to find out about a secret agreement concerning strengthened defence cooperation with neighbouring Sweden and NATO. A senior MP has described it as thing that \u201cshould not be repeated\u201d.\n\nThe Finnish Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs and defence committees plan to voice their displeasure over key information about their country's cooperation with Sweden and NATO being withheld from them, national broadcaster Yle reported.\n\nThe committee members claim they were kept in the dark about an agreement drawn up between Finland, Sweden and NATO in 2018 which boosted information exchange and dialogue in crisis situations, despite the fact that foreign and security policy matters, as well as military cooperation are within their respective committees' jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the agreement, which in government circles has been referred to as an \u201carrangement\u201d, Finland, Sweden and NATO can separately agree to increased information exchange and dialogue in times of crises, Yle reported. The country holding the information or the military alliance would be able to decide whether or not to share it.\n\nHowever, despite the arrangement being agreed upon in 2018, neither committee found out about it until February of this year. According to Yle's informed sources, its terms had never previously been disclosed to MPs and even the very existence of the arrangement had not been previously publicised. The arrangement was reportedly classified as \u201csecret\u201d by NATO and was assigned the highest security classification in Finland.\n\nA Yle source described withholding information from the committees as a serious matter. In effect, parliament did not know everything that Finland was committed to.\n\nWhen the arrangement was concluded, Timo Soini was Foreign Minister and Jussi Niinist\u00f6 was Defence Minister. Since then, Soini has quit politics, whereas Niinist\u00f6 has switched parties. The then-government led by former ex-Centre Party leader Juha Sipil\u00e4 was privy to the arrangement, as was the current government led by Sanna Marin of the Social Democrats.\n\nBoth committees have yet to evaluate the implications of the arrangement in political and military terms. The analysis has been slowed down by the novel coronavirus epidemic . However, the committees say they are planning a joint statement to the Constitutional Law Committee on Parliament\u2019s right of access to information.\n\nOne anonymous source described the arrangement as \u201charmless\u201d and underlined \u201cmutual benefits\u201d. Another one ventured it was not as significant as the Host Nation agreement, which lays the foundation for technical compatibility in case Finland receives NATO troops during drills or in crisis situations.\n\nNevertheless, former Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee, hinted at his displeasure in a Facebook post. While calling the overall performance \u201ccommendable\u201d, he said there was a \u201cmore serious case that should not be repeated\u201d.\n\nFinland and Sweden, while formally non-aligned, have both in recent years been drawn closer to NATO, having stepped up cooperation with the US as well.

A week after, his health condition deteriorated, although he believed that it was common cold. Soon afterwards, he was hospitalized to one of the best clinics in Moscow. Reports about his hospitalization appeared on May 21, although representatives of the Chechen administration have not released any official comments on the subject.\n\nReportedly, Kadyrov started complaining of first symptoms a few days ago, but attributed his ailment to a common respiratory infection. His condition began to deteriorate rapidly, and Chechen doctors advised he should contact Moscow hospitals.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, Ramzan Kadyrov, led a normal life and did not follow any precautions recommended in connection with the rapid spread of coronavirus. He was holding daily meetings with members of his administration and traveling around the republic. It was reported that he went to a remote area of the republic to release nursery-grown mountain goats into the wild.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Chechnya implemented strict quarantine measures in mid-April. Free movement was permitted only for medical personnel, employees of road, communal and emergency services, as well as for those who have special passes.\n\n\n\nThe president of Chechnya offered to send those who violate lockdown measures to agricultural works. \"He didn't want to stay home so he went outside? Well, let him work all day in the field and bring good. We will find work for him. Let him plow the fields, sow and grow,\" said Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\n\n\nOn April 29, Kadyrov ordered to tighten control over the movement of people. Quarantine violators will be deprived of their vehicles and forced to clean the streets, he said. Local residents criticized the tight control of security officials over those who go outside.\n\n\n\nAccording to the regional Ministry of Health, as many as 1005 cases of coronavirus infection have been registered in Chechnya. 620 people recovered, 11 died. Among the infected, there are 92 physicians.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1762,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/business\/202005221079386416-french-carmaker-renault-on-verge-of-bankruptcy-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-economy-minister-says\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"French Carmaker Renault on Verge of Bankruptcy Due to COVID-19 Pandemic, Economy Minister Says","image":"https:\/\/cdn2.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/106435\/58\/1064355853.jpg","body_text":"MOSCOW (Sputnik) \u2013 French auto manufacturer Renault is struggling with the dire consequences of the coronavirus crisis and literally has to \"fight for its existence,\" French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire has said in an interview to the Figaro newspaper, published on Friday.\n\n\"I continue to tell only the truth about the situation of French companies and enterprises. And I have to admit that at the moment Renault has its very existence at stake,\" the minister said.\n\nLe Maire also specified he has not yet signed a document to provide a state-guaranteed loan of five billion euros (over $5,4 billion) that the carmaker had requested to overcome the damage caused by the COVID-19 disease.\n\nThe minister added that the government expects that automakers requesting support commit to developing and producing electric vehicles, having fair relations with contractors and implementing the most advanced technologies in the French territory.\n\nRenault, whose 15-percent share is owned by the French government, was experiencing financial hardships even before the COVID-19 outbreak, having suffered its first net loss in 10 years in 2019. When a two-month lockdown was introduced in France in mid-March, the automaker was forced to close all its factories.\n\nNotably, new car sales in France fell in April by 88.8 percent, according to the report by the French Automobile Manufacturers Committee (CCFA), published on May 4. Car sales in Europe fell by 76.3 percent in April.\n\nAccording to yet unconfirmed information published in French newspaper Le Canard enchained on Wednesday, Renault plans to close four plants in France, namely, in Flins, Dieppe, Choisy-le-Roi and Fonderie de Bretagne.\n\nThis decision will be made within the framework of a program to reduce costs by 2 billion euros, which is to be unveiled on May 29.\n\nFrance began gradually easing its coronavirus-related restrictions on May 11 by partially reopening non-grocery shops, cafes, parks, educational facilities and other public places in so-called green areas of the country, which are less affected by the virus.\n\nSo-called red, or highly infected regions, however, remain under strict monitoring and related safety measures. As of Friday, French authorities have reported 181,951 COVID-19 cases, the world\u2019s seventh-highest, with 28,218 related fatalities.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1770,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/radio_fault_lines\/202005221079390069-biden-opens-8-point-lead-over-trump-in-presidential-election\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Lee Stranahan', 'Garland Nixon']","title":"Biden Opens 8-Point Lead Over Trump in Presidential Election","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107839\/94\/1078399426.jpg","body_text":"Biden Opens 8-Point Lead Over Trump in Presidential Election\n\nOn this episode of Fault Lines, hosts Garland Nixon & Lee Stranahan spoke with guests about what a Biden presidency might look like, the United States' sanctions policy and Mike Pompeo's influence, and the evolution of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nGuests:\n\nTed Rall - Political Cartoonist & Syndicated Columnist | What a Biden Presidency Might Look Like, but Don't Blame Progressives for a Trump 2nd Term\n\nStephen Lendman - Author and Geopolitical Analyst | Mike Pompeo and the United States's Sanction Warfare\n\nDr. Paul Turner - Rachel Carson Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University | The Evolution of the CoV-2\/COVID-19 Pandemic, And Will There Be A Second Wave?\n\nMedea Benjamin - Co-Founder of Human Rights Group Global Exchange and Peace Group 'CODEPINK' | China\/Pompeo\/Inspector General\n\nLee Camp - American Stand-Up Comedian, Writer, Actor, and Activist | The \"Who C.A.R.E.S.?\" Act\n\nIn our first hour we were joined by Ted Rall to talk about where Biden presidency might take the United States, and how progressives have been pushing back against a DNC-led election for years.\n\nIn our second hour we spoke with Stephen Lendman about Mike Pompe and the United States' unmitigated economic warfare internationally.

That same month, that woman from Michigan issued an executive order, that the Daily Show and SNL didn\u2019t mention, \u201cprotecting\u201d residents of long-term care facilities, by forcing nursing homes to admit patients infected with the coronavirus.\n\nHer order dictated that a \u201clong-term care facility must not prohibit admission or readmission of a resident based on COVID-19 testing requirements or results\u201d and told hospitals to discharge coronavirus patients back to the homes they had come from. Some nursing homes were designated as \u2018hubs\u2019 and coronavirus patients were transferred into them, even though these facilities had uninfected residents.\n\nDespite claims that these \u2018hubs\u2019 would carefully separate infected and uninfected patients, that didn\u2019t always happen. While there had been a plan to move coronavirus seniors to the 1,000 bed TCF Center in Detroit which was being used as an overflow hospital for coronavirus patients, they were instead sent to nursing homes. The TCF Center only ended up treating 39 patients before being mothballed.\n\nAs of now, at least 687 nursing home residents in Michigan have died in the pandemic and 290 coronavirus patients have been placed in Michigan nursing homes.

It was a partial reversal, because nursing homes still couldn\u2019t remove infected patients, but hospitals were no longer allowed to discharge infected patients to homes.\n\nCuomo has argued that no one should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths because they would have died anyway. \u201cOlder people\u2026 are going to die from this virus,\u201d he argued, dismissing the outrage of the families of the dead. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any logical rationale to say that they would be alive today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it\u2019s virtually impossible,\u201d he falsely claimed.\n\nHis grandma-killing administration had tried everything, except providing protective equipment, not sending infected patients into nursing homes, or removing infected patients from nursing homes.\n\nCuomo had tried everything to stop killing grandmas, except not killing grandmas.\n\nOn March 31st, New Jersey Commissioner of Health Judith Persichilli issued an order stating that in order to achieve \u201cthe expedited receipt of patients\/residents discharging from hospitals\u201d, \u201cno patient\/resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the post-acute care setting solely based on a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.\u201d It was a virtual copy of the earlier New York State order.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s own nursing home death toll is approaching New York\u2019s 5,000 death toll.\n\n10,000 dead grandmas and grandpas haven\u2019t dented the media\u2019s adoration for Cuomo and Murphy. To paraphrase another leftist, a single dead grandma is a tragedy, 10,000 dead grandmas are a statistic.\n\nBut before New York and New Jersey had even made their move, Governor Tom Wolf\u2019s grandma-killing administration had ordered Pennsylvania nursing homes to accept \u201creadmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital\u201d in order to \u201calleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings\u201d including \u201cpatients who have had the COVID-19 virus.\u201d\n\nWolf\u2019s Secretary of Health, Dr. Richard (Rachel) Levine, had transferred his own mother out of a nursing home and to a hotel.\n\n\u201cDr. Levine has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we do what we need to do in keeping Pennsylvanians safe,\u201d Governor Wolf insisted.\n\nThat phenomenal job amounts to 2,529 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes or 68% of the state\u2019s deaths.\n\nOn March 30th, Governor Newsom\u2019s administration warned skilled nursing facilities that they \u201cshall not refuse to admit or readmit a resident based on their status as a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s directive is nothing less than a death sentence for countless residents,\u201d warned Patricia McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking in a COVID-positive patient for the sole purpose of emptying one hospital bed. In two weeks, I\u2019m sending them back 20 new patients,\u201d Dr. Noah Marco, the Chief Medical Officer of the Los Angeles Jewish Home, said. Half of California\u2019s deaths, or 1,276, have occurred in nursing homes, though not all are the SNFs that were ordered to accept coronavirus patients.\n\nWhitmer, Cuomo, Wolf, and Newsom have been widely praised by the media, even though their disastrous policies likely led to the deaths of thousands of senior citizens in nursing homes. There were states that got it right, protecting senior citizens by barring the transfer of coronavirus patients to nursing homes, requiring negative tests before a transfer, and creating separate facilities.\n\nCuomo, Wolf, Whitmer, and Newsom, not only failed to protect nursing home residents, but their forced readmission policy brought infected patients directly into nursing homes, leading to mass death.\n\n5% of the residents in New York nursing homes are dead, that\u2019s grandma-killing on a genocidal scale.\n\nWhile New York had banned testing as a basis for nursing home admission, in Florida, a \u201cCOVID-19 test must be negative prior to transfer to a post-acute facility\u201d.\n\nGovernor DeSantis noted that his ban on sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes is the reason why the nursing home death toll was 13 times higher in New York and 25 times higher in New Jersey.\n\nThe media falsely claims that after at least 12,000 dead grandmas and grandpas Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did a wonderful job, and DeSantis did a terrible one. Their measure of success isn\u2019t in grandmas saved, but in small businesses shut down, people terrified, and government power made absolute.\n\nAnd if the media gets to write the history of the pandemic, that is what our children will be taught.\n\nThey will learn that in an emergency, wise governors listening to learned experts deprived people of their civil liberties and stopped a catastrophe that could have been much worse. That revisionist history will become the model for handling future crises. A big lie paid for in countless thousands of lives.\n\nThe big lie must not be allowed to stand and the truth must shake our political system until it rings.\n\n\u201cWho can we prosecute for those deaths? Nobody. Mother Nature, God?\u201d Cuomo asked rhetorically.\n\nGovernor Cuomo says that no one should be prosecuted for the nursing home deaths. He\u2019s wrong. The prosecutions should begin with him and tear through the bureaucrats who made and implemented those decisions. Millions of people trusted Cuomo and other Democrat officials to keep them safe. Instead they seized power, abused their authority, and killed enough grandmas to fill miles of cemetery.\n\nThe grandma-killing governors must be brought to justice.\n\nWhen a violent thug was shot by a police officer in a small city in Missouri, the Obama administration came down on Ferguson with an iron fist. How is it possible that thousands of nursing home residents can die, that grandmothers and grandfathers, that 127 veterans in New Jersey\u2019s state-run nursing homes, that 5% of New York\u2019s nursing home population can perish with less care than the concern about a thug?\n\nWhat do we amount to as a country if we not only let that happen, but let them get away with it?\n\nThousands of men and women who worked all their lives and paid their taxes, who raised families, who wanted to watch their grandchildren grow up, died in large enough numbers that their bodies piled up in sheds, and the same nation that ground to a halt for Michael Brown and Freddie Gray shrugs. Where is even a fraction of the outrage that has been lavished on Ahmaud Aubrey for those thousands of wrinkled men and women, black and white, gasping out their last breaths in nursing home beds?\n\nCuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did not believe that they were worth saving. If we do not speak the truth, if we do not fight for justice for them, then are we as a nation really worth saving?\n\nArticle posted with permission from Daniel Greenfield\n\nh\/r TWS\n\nRecent Posts","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1775,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/uk\/489513-covid-pandemic-over-herd-immunity\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Peter Andrews']","title":"Covid-19 pandemic is all but OVER and we already have HERD IMMUNITY, says top Oxford scientist","image":"https:\/\/cdni.rt.com\/files\/2020.05\/article\/5ec806d420302777be184a24.jpg","body_text":"By Peter Andrews , Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics\n\nThe UK government was one of many that reacted to the coronavirus outbreak based on worst-case scenario predictions. But the author of an alternative model has restated her position, saying the virus is already \u201con its way out.\u201d\n\nSunetra Gupta is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford. Back in March, before the UK\u2019s lockdown, she and her team published a study suggesting that the coronavirus may have infected 50% of the British population back in early March, before the lockdown measures were put in place. The model concluded that continuing on a path toward herd immunity would be the most sensible course of action.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Humans are not herds\u2019: WHO thrashes \u2018brutal arithmetic\u2019 of herd immunity to beat Covid-19 pandemic\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s government originally chose to aim for a model like Prof. Gupta\u2019s, just as those notorious irrational hotheads the Swedes were. It soon, however, gave in to public (read: Twitter) pressure. Boris called in that professional harbinger of doom, Imperial College\u2019s Neil Ferguson, instead.\n\nA tale of two models\n\nProf. Ferguson\u2019s model was nothing short of apocalyptic, featuring as it did half a million dead, and bodies piled up in car parks outside hospitals \u2013 everything but a yawning crevice in the ground and satyrs raining hell from the sky. So stark was the warning that he seemed to take it to heart, deciding to treasure a few moments with his married mistress while he could. For this small indulgence, he was eventually forced to resign from his post. But his thinking informs the government\u2019s coronavirus policy to this day.\n\nRead more\n\nProf. Gupta\u2019s model, on the other hand, predicted that just 1 in 1,000 of those infected with Covid-19 would need to go to hospital, and possibly an order of magnitude less. This would have placed the true mortality rate at 0.1% or lower, something much more like the flu and much less like a Hollywood disaster movie. Today, almost two months on, the problem with all of this is pretty much the same as it was then: we just don\u2019t have enough information.\n\nOne body of evidence that has built up since, however, is a number of studies involving \u2018antibody tests\u2019 that have been conducted around the world. The basic idea is that, if you have recovered from Covid-19, your immune system\u2019s battle with the virus will have left a trace of antibodies in your blood.\n\nAssuming that the antibody studies are more or less accurate, it would appear that Ferguson, and not Gupta, was closest to the truth. They show that even in badly hit countries, something like only 5-10% of people have antibodies. So has Professor Gupta repented, pledging allegiance to the new church of Ferguson-ology, whose teachings now determine our lives?\n\nSticking to her guns\n\nAnything but. In her first interview since the original study was published, Prof. Gupta doubles down on her opinion that the coronavirus is not as bad as all that. Firstly, she reminds us how \u201ca lot of these antibody tests are extremely unreliable.\u201d Like everything with coronavirus, there are caveats attached: we just don\u2019t know how accurately these tests detect antibodies in people who have been infected.\n\nProf. Gupta also points to the total absence of a pattern across countries with wildly different lockdown strategies as being highly suggestive of \u201chidden\u201d herd immunity. \u201cIn almost every context we\u2019ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away \u2013 almost like clockwork. Different countries have had different lockdown policies, and yet what we\u2019ve observed is almost a uniform pattern of behaviour.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it doesn\u2019t matter what governments do or not in reaction to the virus, as it had already been spreading freely through their countries for at least a month longer than they had assumed.\n\nAlso on rt.com The man behind the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown has screwed his mistress, screwed us all, & now \u2013 thankfully \u2013 screwed his career\n\nShe continues: \u201cTo me, that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the build-up of immunity \u2026 I think that the epidemic has largely come and is on its way out in this country.\u201d Prof. Gupta is magnanimous, and while noting that \u201cthe jury is still out,\u201d she says Prof. Ferguson\u2019s model, while definitely being a \u201cworst case scenario,\u201d was possible, even if it was not plausible.\n\nAs if to put the tin hat on her dismantling of the government\u2019s actions to this point, Prof. Gupta warns that the socially distant lockdowns are in fact precisely the conditions that put more people at risk of dying. \u201cRemaining in a state of lockdown is extremely dangerous from the point of view of the vulnerability of the entire population to new pathogens. Effectively we used to live in a state approximating lockdown 100 years ago, and that was what created the conditions for the Spanish Flu to come in and kill 50 million people.\u201d\n\nThe full interview is well worth listening to, especially as Prof. Ferguson is no longer gracing the airwaves with his opinions. His model was done at Imperial College London \u2013 a very great university, no doubt. But the modellers at the University of Oxford report are hardly dunces either. Make up your own mind as to who was closer to the truth. Hopefully, history will bear it out; after all, it is usually written by the victors.\n\nLike this story?

You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5\/01\/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5\/14\/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201ctesting and contact tracers\u201d to be sent directly to everyone\u2019s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201cfor other purposes,\u201d such as \u201csupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201d\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201cnational COVID health emergency.\u201d Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u2019ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and\/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201cfaith-based\u201d and \u201cschool-based\u201d institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201cconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201d require no viral testing, and only \u201csuspicion of infection.\u201d This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201cpublic health safety,\u201d into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201cwar on terror,\u201d but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201cNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201d Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"","reliability":0},{"news_id":1791,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/489475-russia-covid-antibody-testing-percentage\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Jonny Tickle']","title":"Covid-19 mass screening: first results show 14% of tested Russians have coronavirus antibodies","image":"https:\/\/cdni.rt.com\/files\/2020.05\/article\/5ec7c99685f5400e6d1d3c9a.jpg","body_text":"After the first few days of private clinic antibody testing in Russia, one national chain has revealed that at least 14% of the 40,000 people who took the test in their laboratory received a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nInvitro, the chain who conducted the tests, began mass testing for Covid-19 antibodies on May 18, using their entire network, which comprises almost 1,500 medical offices.

Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1835,"url":"https:\/\/gellerreport.com\/2020\/05\/fauci-lockdown-damage.html\/","publisher":"Geller Report News","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Pamela Geller']","title":"Mastermind of LOCKDOWN Dr. Anthony Fauci NOW says staying closed for too long could cause \u2018IRREPARABLE DAMAGE\u2019","image":"https:\/\/gellerreport.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screen-Shot-2020-05-22-at-2.10.39-PM.png","body_text":"He can\u2019t run away from what he has done.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci says staying closed for too long could cause \u2018irreparable damage\u2019\n\nStay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing \u201cirreparable damage\u201d if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,\u201d he told CNBC.\n\nStay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing \u201cirreparable damage\u201d if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,\u201d Fauci said during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Meg Tirrell on \u201cHalftime Report.\u201d\n\nHe said the U.S. had to institute severe measures because Covid-19 cases were exploding then. \u201cBut now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is, to begin to seriously look at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try to get back to some degree of normal.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fauci also cautioned states against reducing social distancing measures too quickly, adding they must take \u201cvery significant precautions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that.

That is my major concern.\u201d\n\nThe virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, less than five months ago, has infected more than 1.5 million people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Data on neutralizing antibodies for the remaining patients is expected to come out later.\n\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go obviously,\u201d Fauci said Friday. \u201cThere are so many things that need to be done.

In the entire country, a record 38.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. That corresponds to nearly 25% of the entire United States labor force. While many of these folks are receiving unemployment from state and federal government, many others are not.\n\nMillions of Americans \u2014 who watched states close non-essential businesses, subsequently crushing their careers \u2014 cannot even access unemployment benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While some of these problems have been remedied, for others, collecting unemployment insurance was never an option.\n\nBusiness owners who were unable to obtain an SBC loan or other forms of COVID-19 government subsistence have been frantically fighting to reopen their business as they watched their life savings go up in flames. The Free Thought Project has reported on multiple instances in which people unable to obtain government support have tried to reopen their businesses to support themselves, only to leave them in handcuffs. It\u2019s a catch-22.\n\nOf those millions of jobless claims in the United States, over a quarter-million of them were in the state of Oklahoma. With a population just under 4 million, 275,000 unemployed residents are massive. While some of these folks have likely sought out and found jobs to support themselves and their families, others have likely endured conditions that may have prevented them from doing so.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nTrump or Biden, who will win?

Now, in spite of the fact that this record spike in unemployment was a function of the state\u2019s COVID-19 measures, Oklahoma is taking action in the form of evictions.\n\nOn their Facebook page this week, the Oklahoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced that they will begin physically evicting residents unable to pay their bills. It reads as follows:\n\nEVICTION NOTICE UPDATE We know that this will be difficult, but want to give as much notice as possible regarding OCSO deputies serving eviction notices. Deputies will start serving judicial eviction orders this week, and enforcing evictions on May 26, 2020. We understand how tough times are currently for many as a result of the health crisis the past few months, but we must enforce orders issued by the courts. Once the order is served tenants have 48-hours to leave the premises of the residence they are renting\/leasing. Please, if you are set for an eviction hearing, attend. Make your case to the judge, the only person who can determine your case. Civil process, and our issuing evictions is mandated by state law: https:\/\/www.oscn.net\/applications\/oscn\/DeliverDocument.asp\u2026 We will be compassionate, and respectful during scheduled evictions. We are hopeful that everyone issued an eviction will be able to make living arrangements.\n\nNow, as the inevitable effects of the government\u2019s shutdown order crash the economy and force people to choose between eating and paying their rent, that same government is going to start kicking them out of their homes.\n\nSee how that works?\n\nAs banks and other large corporations across the country receive hundreds of billions in Federal money \u2014 ensuring a lifetime of debt for future generations \u2014 Joe Sixpack on Main Street, USA is told to kick rocks.\n\nRELATED: The Homosexual Rights Movement and Child Sexual Abuse\n\nNo one here is advocating for people to be able to squat and exploit this situation to get out of paying their house note or rent. However, that is not the case here. While grocery stores and fast-food restaurants are hiring, other businesses are told they must operate at 25% capacity or remain closed entirely. This is hardly sustainable when it comes to maintaining a decent workforce with substantial pay.\n\nUnfortunately, this is likely the beginning of an economic snowball that will continue to grow as the next few months roll on. As TFTP has predicted from the beginning, the shutdown of the economy will have lasting consequences, unprecedented in nature, and that will be here for a long time.

Was it a vigilante drone or an aerial white knight? Was it friend or foe?\n\nThat\u2019s a highly relevant question about drones in general, which are suddenly everywhere during the coronavirus crisis, taking over any number of human tasks as people hunker indoors.\n\nDrones have been working as police officers, soaring over the banks of the Seine in Paris and the city squares of Mumbai, to patrol for social distancing violators.\n\nThey\u2019re delivering medical supplies in Rwanda and snacks in Virginia. They\u2019re hovering over crowds China to scan for fevers below.\n\nCoronavirus has been devastating to humans, but may well prove a decisive step toward a long-prophesied Drone Age, when aerial robots begin to shed their Orwellian image as tools of war and surveillance and become a common feature of daily life, serving as helpers and, perhaps soon, companions.\n\n\u201cRobots are so often cast as the bad guys,\u201d said Daniel H. Wilson, a former roboticist and the author of the 2011 science fiction novel \u201cRobopocalypse.\u201d \u201cBut what\u2019s happening now is weirdly utopic, as opposed to dystopic. Robots are designed to solve problems that are dull, dirty and dangerous, and now we have a sudden global emergency in which the machines we\u2019re used to fearing are uniquely well suited to swoop in and save the day.\u201d\n\nFirst, however, we\u2019ll have to get past the fears of an actual robopocalypse, with robots of the sky rising up to take over while their wetware-enabled former masters huddle in fear below.\n\nEye in the Sky\n\nThe origins of the \u201cAnti-Covid-19 Volunteer Drone Task Force,\u201d which turned out to be the work of a Queens drone enthusiast, may have confused New Yorkers initially, but in most cities, there is no question who is running the current aerial patrol. Law enforcement officials in cities and towns around the world have been using drones to scan parks, beaches and city squares for violators wandering into the safe spaces of others.\n\nIn China, drones have served as educators or enforcers, depending on your point of view, alerting citizens with unsettlingly folksy warnings about virus violations in robotic voices from above, as reported by CNN.\n\n\u201cYes auntie, this is the drone speaking to you,\u201d said one drone, speaking to an elderly woman below in an eerie bullhorn echo, according to a video published by Global Times, a state-controlled newspaper. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t walk about without wearing a mask.\u201d\n\nGlobal Times also published an account of another drone. A voice from above castigated a small child peering skyward while seated with a man who was violating quarantine rules by playing mahjong in public: \u201cDon\u2019t look at the drone, child. Ask your father to leave immediately.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a government eye in the sky doesn\u2019t always play so well in the United States, where personal liberty is a founding precept taken very seriously in many regions.\n\n\u201cCovid-19? More like Covid-1984,\u201d read one recent Reddit post on a thread about police drones flying over encampments of homeless people in cities such as Fort Worth, and Chula Vista, Calif., blasting them with messages about coronavirus prevention. \u201cIt really feels like we are living in some dystopian science fiction novel,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cDid the drone fly over blueprints for a light saber?\u201d another commenter fired back. \u201cNot everything is a conspiracy.\u201d\n\nBut automated oversight can be a blunt instrument. A police drone deployed in Fairfield, Conn., to monitor beaches for social distancing also warned a group of \u201cjuveniles\u201d trespassing on the roof of a local elementary school, according to one news account.\n\nIn nearby Westport, police scrapped plans for their own drone project to scan crowds for fever temperatures, heart and temperature rates, and even sneezes and coughs, after outcry from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\u201cThe big concern is that the coronavirus crisis is going to normalize drones and entrench them in American life,\u201d said Jay Stanley, a privacy and technology specialist for the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe fear is many of these incursions on freedom will outlast the crisis.\u201d\n\nWhile a drone itself is just a tool, neither inherently good nor evil, it is a tool with nearly unlimited powers for surveillance, Mr. Stanley added. Drones can be equipped with so-called stingrays to collect information from people\u2019s mobile phones, night-vision cameras, GPS sensors, radar, lidar (laser detection technology for creating three-dimensional maps of an area), as well as thermal and infrared cameras.\n\nEnough people distrust drones that \u201cdrone rage\u201d incidents between drone enthusiasts and citizens who do not wish to be filmed from above have become a regular occurrence, Mr. Stanley said. One Colorado town even proposed a tongue-in-cheek ordinance in 2014 allowing citizens to shoot down drones invading their airspace, a proposal that itself was shot down by the F.A.A.\n\nResistance to pandemic patrol drones has not been confined to privacy watchdogs on the political left. On the right, outlets like Breitbart have also noted that many of the drones surveilling our cities are made in China, often by DJI, the world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer, whose headquarters are in Shenzhen.\n\nSome Republican officials have made the same point.\n\n\u201cUsing drones, donated by a Chinese company, to spy on Americans during the #coronavirus pandemic?\u201d read a tweet from the official House Judiciary Republicans account. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea.\u201d\n\nDrones have other uses besides snooping, of course. They have stepped (or soared) up as aerial virus blasters, with authorities in countries around the world \u2014 China, Dubai, Indonesia, France, as well as the United States \u2014 using them to sanitize city streets.\n\n(It\u2019s up to you to decide if government drones spraying cities for pathogens sounds creepy.)\n\nDrones are also performing crucial roles on the medical front lines that may be described as humanitarian \u2026 if they were performed by humans.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment when the drone industry gets to show what it can do,\u201d said Miriam McNabb, the editor of Dronelife, an industry news site, and the C.E.O. of Job for Drones, an online drone services marketplace. \u201cThings like drone delivery are lifesaving applications that are changing people\u2019s perceptions of drones.\u201d\n\nZipline, a San Francisco-based start-up founded in 2014 that airdrops medical supplies and ferries tests from more than 1,000 hospitals in Ghana and Rwanda by drone, replacing the need for face-to-face contact.\n\nZipline\u2019s fixed-wing drones have already made 30,600 deliveries of medical products in those countries since the start of the pandemic, the company said: lately delivering cancer drugs, for example, to patients in remote villages who are unable to travel to oncology centers because of quarantine.\n\n\u201cZipline are the heroes of drone delivery,\u201d Ms. McNabb said. \u201cIn parts of Rwanda, where road infrastructure doesn\u2019t support delivery, it\u2019s either three days on the back of a motorbike or 15 minutes by drone.\u201d\n\nIn the United States they are at last delivering more quotidian consumer items too, as long dreamed by Jeff Bezos of Amazon.\n\nLast month, Wing, a drone-delivery service owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, received the first Federal Aviation Administration approval for commercial package delivery, starting in Christiansburg, Va., a town of about 22,000, which is near Wing\u2019s testing facility at nearby Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. (Wing is also operating in Helsinki, Finland, as well as Canberra and Logan in Australia.)\n\nWing\u2019s home deliveries of medications from Walgreens have proved particularly popular with quarantined seniors who are most at risk, said Jonathan Bass, a Wing spokesman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few emerging technologies that has attracted a lot of early adopters over the age of 65,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Wing is also starting to out-Amazon Amazon, delivering must-have items like toilet paper and groceries. Merchandise is kept at a central Wing facility, and orders can be made through the Wing app, which allows customers to chart progress of their drone on a map, as with Uber or Lyft.\n\nWhile useful for temporary shut-ins, drone delivery has served as a lifeline for small businesses dealing with a collapse in foot traffic.\n\n\u201cThe first two weeks after Covid hit were rough; it felt like somebody put the e-brake on,\u201d said Luke Brugh \u2014 conveniently pronounced \u201cbrew,\u201d as he owns Brugh Coffee Co. in Christiansburg with his wife, Cassie. Wing, he said, has allowed them to double the sales of canned cold brew, which has helped make up for the loss.\n\nAnd this may just be the beginning. Just as World War II hurried the development of emerging technologies like computers, rocketry, jet aircraft and atomic energy, the pandemic may speed the development, and adoption of, drone technology.\n\n\u201cMajor world events can alter technological development cycles, causing them to accelerate or to slow down,\u201d said Richard Yonck, the founder of Intelligent Future Consulting in Seattle and a former board member of the Association of Professional Futurists. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that now with drones and other automation in response to the pandemic. There\u2019s a push to develop new tools that can reduce people\u2019s exposure to the virus. What can we automate and by how much?\n\n\u201cOf course, this could also accelerate future job losses,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is something we\u2019d have to deal with down the road.\u201d\n\nInvading the Dream Factory\n\nOn a Tuesday night in April, a company called Verge Aero flew 140 illuminated drones in the sky above the University of Pennsylvania. The drones performed as synchronized points of light as they formed giant hearts, medical crosses and American flags, as part of the #PhillyShinesBlue and global #LightItBlue campaigns honoring health care professionals and other essential workers.\n\nThis 21st-century equivalent of a fireworks display was a case of drones serving to uplift, as opposed to, you know, simply lift \u2014 or spray, or fire missiles, or seize human jobs in an economy where unemployment is nearing Great Depression levels.\n\nAnd it also may prove to be one of many examples of the pandemic helping to make drones seem more endearing.\n\nDuring the lockdown, drones have also shown their potential as investigative reporters, bringing to light heart-wrenching stories like the mass graves for unclaimed bodies of Covid-19 victims on Hart Island in New York.\n\nThe footage was shot by a photographer, George Steinmetz, whose drone was confiscated by police for photographing the island without permission from the city\u2019s Department of Correction. It was widely shared, illustrating the death toll beyond the statistics in Governor Cuomo\u2019s daily briefing.\n\nAnd at a time when professional storytellers \u2014 novelists, bloggers and many journalists \u2014 find themselves walled off to the global story around them, drones have pierced the veil of quarantine. They have created hauntingly poetic imagery of countless empty cities \u2014 San Francisco; Las Vegas; Wuhan, China \u2014 that says as much about loss in the coronavirus age as any written account.\n\n\u201cDrones sell this idea of emptiness, this lack of life better than anything,\u201d said Dexter Kennedy, 29, a drone photographer in Hoboken, N.J., who has been shooting aerial footage of abandoned streets in Philadelphia, as well as the empty boardwalks of Atlantic City and Jersey City during the lockdown.\n\n\u201cYou get 100 feet up and you can really see the big picture,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cA boardwalk that would normally have thousands of people on it is totally empty. All the rides are empty. The Ferris wheel is not moving. You can see the grid patterns of the street, but no one\u2019s out. It looks like an apocalypse movie.\u201d\n\nMr. Kennedy, 29, is also the director of flight operations at Flying Monster, a drone production company that has shot footage for numerous television shows and films, including \u201cWatchmen,\u201d \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner\u2019s upcoming \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d\n\nMr. Kennedy sees a big expansion of drone duties in Hollywood, should suspended productions resume with new social distancing measures in place. Drones can perform location scouting remotely, he said, minimize the need for crew members to share camera equipment and even allow a director to orchestrate aerial scenes from home, with a remote feed.\n\n\u201cUp to this point, drones have been kind of a luxury for Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cNow I think they\u2019re moving into the \u2018necessity\u2019 category.\u201d\n\nAs drones work their way further into the dream factory of Hollywood, they may also insinuate themselves further into our imagination.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it before. As the age of robotics dawned in the mid-20th century, popular culture churned out sympathetic, humanoid robots, like the Rosey the robot maid in the 1960s television show \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d or the robot in \u201cLost in Space,\u201d which helped make an unsettling new technology seem friendly and approachable.\n\nThe boom to the drone industry during the pandemic comes at a point when drones were already poised to creep so far into our daily lives that techno-futurists are fretting about \u201crobot smog\u201d \u2014 drones as a new form of air pollution.\n\nDevelopers have created drones as jogging companions, barking out encouragement to the sweat drenched, and someday, perhaps, pet sitters, if one IBM patent comes to fruition. Drones with human feelings, meanwhile, are a running gag in The Onion, as with the recent headline \u201cU.S. Claims Drone Was Minding Own Business on Its Way to Church When Iran Attacked It Out Nowhere.\u201d\n\nIf and when the pandemic ever ends, we may develop an unimagined kinship with our aerial assistants, just as we have with other types of robots.\n\n\u201cSoldiers in the field have famously anthropomorphized their robots \u2014 naming them, rescuing them, even holding funerals,\u201d said Daniel Wilson.\n\nGranted, he said, the marketplace has shown little interest in robots that do not perform valuable tasks. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for a robot to be cute or inspirational, it has to solve a problem before people will fall in love,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.\n\nOnce the robot does, though, \u201cthe human mind will find a way to include it in the landscape of our lives,\u201d he said, just as some supermarket employees have attached cute, googly eyes on the inventory robots they work alongside.\n\nIn a sense, they have no choice. As with drones in the age of coronavirus, Mr. Wilson said, \u201cthe robots aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe post The Drones Were Ready for This Moment appeared first on New York Times.","news_guard_score":29.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1875,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/489566-danish-football-aarhus-virtual-grandstand\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"The future of football?

You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5\/01\/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5\/14\/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201ctesting and contact tracers\u201d to be sent directly to everyone\u2019s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201cfor other purposes,\u201d such as \u201csupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201d\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201cnational COVID health emergency.\u201d Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u2019ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and\/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201cfaith-based\u201d and \u201cschool-based\u201d institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201cconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201d require no viral testing, and only \u201csuspicion of infection.\u201d This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201cpublic health safety,\u201d into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201cwar on terror,\u201d but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201cNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201d Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"","reliability":0},{"news_id":1883,"url":"https:\/\/www.americanthinker.com\/blog\/2020\/05\/turning_nursing_homes_into_extermination_sites_the_gretchen_factor.html","publisher":"American Thinker","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":"['J.R.

And boy, it is a shocker.\n\nIt turns out that victim and perp were sent to the Westwood Nursing Center in Detroit due to the fact that both were suffering from COVID. The older man, an Army vet, was snatched from his apartment and dumped in the nursing home without any notification of his relatives, who then spent a considerable amount of time looking for him, to no avail.\n\nAs for the younger man, who is evidently named Jaydon Hayden, though the police haven\u2019t yet confirmed it, he was suffering from some sort of breakdown and had been sent to a group home to await treatment when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus and also dumped in the Westview facility. His father, who seems to be a decent sort, says he never should have been put there.\n\nHayden is now in police custody, while his aged victim is in the hospital.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that the victim was placed in the nursing home to die while the authorities aimed Hayden at him like a torpedo.\n\nIt has not escaped my notice (as it has everybody in the legacy media) that Detroit lies within the realm of her Imperial Majesty, Gretchen the Terrible. Nor has it come as a surprise that Gretchen has adapted the Democratic governor\u2019s go-to policy of using nursing homes as ice floes to dump the sick atop of. But I must admit that I was taken back to learn that Michigan has added \u201cdisappearing\u201d patients to the formula. Leave it to Gretchen Whitmer to combine Andrew Cuomo\u2019s already inhumane dump-the-sick policy with the tactics of the KGB.\n\nClearly, we have yet to plumb the depths of the Cuomo policy. It has always been evident that it was a barely veiled effort to warehouse the sick until they popped off. But this \u2013 placing the violent mentally disturbed in the same facilities as the deathly ill with no safeguards or security whatsoever \u2013 reveals a callousness that beggars belief. The administrations and bureaucracies of the states following the dump \u2018em and run policy \u2013 New York, California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania being the chief culprits \u2013 have reached a plateau of psychopathy seldom witnessed in this country\u2019s politics. As for stupidity, we\u2019ll let that speak for itself. (Interestingly, Michigan was not even supposed to be on this list. We can hazard to guess that, like PA\u2019s Tom Wolf, Gretchen slipped the policy into effect by stealth, under the impression that the media would let her slide.)\n\nNor have we seen the end of it. Yesterday Gretchen announced that, obeying the Will of the People, she will continue her iron-fisted policies until at least June 19th. Plenty of those sickies in hiding who need to be rousted out, you know. Not to mention those defiant barbers and ministers. Got to keep an eye on the big picture, playmates. Gretchen will qualify for that VP slot yet, you\u2019ll see.

The French diplomat Talleyrand said of them, \u201cThey had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\u201d\n\nUsing that metric, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer is giving the Bourbon monarchs a run for their money. On Friday, she announced that her beleaguered state would remain locked down through the last minute of June 12.\n\nDuring this time of coronavirus, Whitmer has distinguished herself as the governor with both the harshest and most random lockdown orders. Whitmer\u2019s \u201cStay Home, Stay Safe Executive Order\u201d went into effect on March 23. At the time, several states were going into lockdown mode, ostensibly to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d \u2013 that is, to slow the disease\u2019s spread so that medical facilities would not be overwhelmed. Whitmer, like several other governors, quarantined everyone, locking them in their homes except for allowing them to go to major chain stores or to work for (and still get paid by) the government.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s orders included carveouts for activities that raised taxes or advanced social policies (allowing alcohol, pot, and lottery tickets purchases, as well as abortions). At the same time, she almost randomly issued orders affecting harmless or constitutionally protected behavior, such as banning travel to vacation homes, forcing stores to close whole sections, banning store advertising and hydroxychloroquine, and forbidding jet skiing and outdoor gardening.\n\nWhile Whitmer has backed off of some of her more extreme bans (e.g., store advertising, hydroxychloroquine), that hasn\u2019t stopped her from being controversial. Her administration waged a brutal war against a 77-year-old barber who had to choose between ignoring her ban against personal grooming services or starving.\n\nOn Thursday, a judge finally set the matter to rest by ruling in favor of Karl Manke\u2019s barbershop, but not before hundreds of people, both barbers and customers, gathered outside the Michigan Capitol to give and receive protest haircuts. Michigan is not the only state preventing people from grooming, but the optics of waging war against a 77-year-old barber in Owosso, a town of only 15,194 people outside of Lansing, were ugly.\n\nMeanwhile, unlike Whitmer, we\u2019ve all learned a few things: The Wuhan virus is not easily transmissible from casual surface contact, the mortality rate is significantly lower than initially thought, Vitamin D helps, medical facilities have not been overrun, states that opened early have had fewer deaths, and 29.7% of Wuhan virus deaths occurred in the Michigan nursing homes that Whitmer had forced to accept sick patients.\n\nAside from having a naturally tyrannical streak, Whitmer is also aiming for bigger things than the Michigan statehouse. The Democrats\u2019 probable candidate, Joe Biden, has confirmed that she\u2019s one of the people on his shortlist for a running mate. Whitmer is therefore working to distinguish herself by opposing Trump as hard as possible (see the hydroxychloroquine ban, above).\n\nFor the past couple of days, Whitmer and her attorney general, Dana Nessel, another strident leftist, have been garnering headlines by complaining that President Trump failed to wear a mask when he visited a Ford plant in Ypsilanti. Indeed, Nessel went so far as to say that the president is no longer welcome in Michigan and threatened to sue the Ford plan for violating the state\u2019s mask rules. The fact that Trump (a) is regularly tested for the virus and (b) wore the mask when not giving a speech didn\u2019t matter to leftists anxious to show how tough they are.\n\nGiven her personality and political posturing, should anyone be surprised that Whitmer has announced that her state\u2019s stay-at-home order, originally scheduled to end next Thursday, will continue until 11:59 p.m. on June 12, with Michiganders still forced to remain flabby and ungroomed?\n\nEarlier this week, the governor did allow social gatherings of 10 people or fewer to resume and retail stores to arrange appointment-only shopping for customers. But things like gyms, hair salons and barbershops remain closed.\n\nMichiganders are already getting restless under their governor\u2019s arbitrary and capricious rule. It\u2019s entirely possible, therefore, that at some point they will break and engage in mass civil disobedience.\n\nThe Michigan unemployment rate hit 22% three weeks ago and is still rising. Sooner rather than later, Michigan citizens need to remind their political class that they are public servants, not monarchs. While Whitmer, in true Bourbon fashion, has learned nothing and forgotten nothing, it\u2019s to be hoped that the people of her state will do better than that.\n\nPostscript: This post just touches upon the lockdown. We also know now that Whitmer\u2019s Green policies affected the dams that broke, flooding several communities in an already hard-hit state.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1907,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/uk\/202005231079398091-dominic-cummings-lockdown-journey-was-in-line-with-guidelines-downing-street-says\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"Dominic Cummings' Lockdown Journey Was in Line With Guidelines, Downing Street Says","image":"https:\/\/cdn2.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107939\/82\/1079398219.jpg","body_text":"Boris Johnson's aide is facing calls to resign following reports that he travelled from London to his parents' home in Durham with COVID-19 symptoms during the lockdown.\n\nDominic Cummings, an adviser to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, went on a journey during lockdown to ensure that his child could be cared for - which was in line with social distancing guidelines, according to Downing Street.\n\nNo 10 points out that Cummings, who has been heavily criticised for flouting self-isolation, himself believes that he behaved reasonably and legally.\n\n\"Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally\", a Downing Street spokesman said.\n\nThese comments come shortly after The Guardian and the Daily Mirror published a joint investigation, which revealed that Cummings took a trip to his parents' house in Durham just a day after he confirmed that he had been self-isolating with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nSources cited in the report said that Cummings travelled to Durham to make sure that his parents could take care of his son in the event that he and his spouse would be unable to look after him.\n\nSeparately, the report said that the police investigated the matter and found he was staying in \"part of a house\" at a Durham address, and \"officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel\".\n\nFollowing the bombshell revelation, the Labour Party has demanded a \"swift explanation\" from the Tory government, while the Lib Dems urged Cummings to resign if he indeed broke the social distancing rules.\n\n\"Dominic Cummings should have done the right thing, he should have resigned but now that he hasn't, Boris Johnson must show

Two working groups, headed by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have been formed to carry out this job.\n\nThe aim of the effort, codenamed \u201cProject Defend\u201d, is said to pinpoint Britain\u2019s main economic weaknesses and adopt measures that prevent attempts by \u201cpotentially hostile\u201d foreign nation\u2019s to use those apparent weaknesses to their own advantage.\n\nLondon has defied significant pressure from Washington after previously announcing that the UK would, with conditions, allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to assist in the implementation of a 5G network in the nation.\n\nThe UK government said that the Chinese company, which has been accused by the US of providing back-door access to Chinese intelligence services, would be excluded from certain \u201csafety-related\u201d and \u201csafety-critical\u201d networks.\n\nWashington has repeatedly warned London that permitting Huawei to take part in developing the country\u2019s 5G network would put the US-UK intelligence-sharing agreements at risk.\n\nIn May 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei over allegations that the company\u2019s hardware and software connections sent data to Chinese intelligence agencies, amid trade tensions between the two economic powers that began in January 2018.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly denied the accusations.\n\nThe US has also urged other countries to refrain from using Huawei equipment when adopting 5G network technology, as part of its pressure campaign on the Chinese tech corporation.\n\nBaltimore Pastor Stacey Shiflett joins The Alex Jones Show to break down why he tore a cease and desist letter during a recent service in defiance of an unconstitutional lockdown of society.\n\nPick up the next evolution of activated nascent iodine today with Survival Shield X-3 now at 60% off!","news_guard_score":25,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1958,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/asia\/202005231079396509-us-provoking-india-china-tensions-but-delhi-doesnt-want-to-be-used-as-tool-analysts-say\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"US Provoking India-China Tensions But Delhi Doesn't Want to be Used as Tool, Analysts Say","image":"https:\/\/cdn2.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/105613\/80\/1056138031.jpg","body_text":"US diplomatic circles have supported India in its confrontation with China on the border and in the Indian Ocean. First Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Alice Wells, who is resigning in May, has accused China of using border clashes with India to change the status quo at the border.\n\nOn 20 May, Alice Wells, a US ambassador, spoke at an online conference at the Atlantic Council, one of America's leading think tanks, regarding the border standoff between India and China.\n\nTalking to Rish Verma, the US Ambassador to India from 2014-2017, she drew parallels between the confrontation in the Himalayas and the situation regarding the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe diplomat called China's actions on the border with India, as well as in the South China Sea, \"constant aggression\", \"constant attempts\" to change existing norms and the status quo, Business Insider India cited her as saying.\n\nShe then called to counter China, both in the South China Sea and on India's land and sea borders, while adding that the increased presence of the Chinese military on the border, where temporary clashes are quite common, has caused concern on the Indian side. According to her, the issue is becoming more acute in light of Beijing's efforts to \"evade responsibility and spread misinformation\".\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2020 \/ STR This aerial photo taken on January 2, 2017 shows a Chinese navy formation, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning (C), during military drills in the South China Sea\n\nMany analysts believe that the United States has always been interested in maintaining tensions between India and China. This is one of the tools to implement their Indo-Pacific strategy, aimed, among other things, at strengthening the country's influence in South Asia, Andrei Volodin, an IMEMO RAS expert, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, pointed out:\n\n\"The statement (by the American ambassador) is just one example. Moreover, this statement obviously fits into the Trump administration's current general strategy to discredit China as the 'source' of the coronavirus pandemic. The US, which is conducting an anti-Chinese campaign, is now trying to involve the maximum number of not only their satellites in Western Europe, but also the maximum number of Asian states. Asian countries, in general, react quite neutrally to these attempts\".\n\nAt the same time, the expert ruled out the possibility that US support for India in the border conflict with China could provoke it to take unilateral action. In the context of the epidemiological crisis, even the Indian military believes that it's necessary to focus as much as possible on the economy and development.\n\nThey are ready to come to terms with the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is redistributing forces and assets in favour of the civilian sector.\n\n\"In addition, the experience of the 1962 war and subsequent conflicts between China and India is not in India's favour\", Andrei Volodin said.\n\nChina's restraint and its ability to achieve mutual understanding with India frustrate Washington's strategic goal of them coming into conflict, as Delhi appreciates its independence and is unlikely to want Washington to use it as a tool to contain Beijing, Wang Peng from the People's University of China said, commenting on the US diplomat's statements:\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific Strategy is the key strategy among the Trump administration's global foreign policy aims. In June 2017, there was a standoff between China and India in Doklam, and in November of the same year, the United States introduced the concept of the Indo-Pacific Strategy at the APEC meeting in Vietnam. There were only a few months between those events. It is no coincidence that many analysts believe that the Sino-Indian confrontation could have affected the development of Trump's strategy. The US has never stopped trying to form a political 'square' consisting of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia to deter China\".\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo \/ Manish Swarup U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embrace after giving a joint statement in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020.\n\n\"Meanwhile, China maintains restraint and seeks mutual understanding with the Indian side; therefore the United States cannot achieve its strategic goals. The Trump administration relies heavily on provoking disputes and increased tension between certain countries and China to achieve its own goals, which allows the United States to make these countries even more strategically dependent. However, the problem is that the US strategy is contrary to India's national interests and cultural traditions. India really appreciates its independence and doesn't want to be used as a tool\".\n\nThe provocative nature of Alice Well's statement is obvious given the difficult situation in the northwest section of the Line of Actual Control between China and India. In fact, her words can even be regarded as US support for India's territorial claims against China, which could make the situation on the Sino-Indian border even more explosive. This month there have already been two, albeit minor, clashes involving dozens of military personnel from both sides.\n\nAdditional defensive structures are also being constructed on both sides of the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, which also increases the tension. The other day, the Chinese military reported that India had built fortifications to deliberately foment conflict and unilaterally modify the existing border control system. The Global Times reported, citing a source in the PLA, that it had successfully restored the status quo in the Galwan Valley.\n\nFor its part, the Indian Express reported on 20 May that tensions along the Sino-Indian border in Ladakh near lake Pangong Tso had increased. According to the Indian newspaper, the Chinese military had tripled the number of patrol boats in the area to match the number of Indian craft in the waters off the western shore of the lake.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1964,"url":"https:\/\/theduran.com\/local-elections-suggest-virginia-may-be-turning-red\/","publisher":"The Duran","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":"['Malcolm Harris']","title":"Local Elections Suggest Virginia May be Turning Red","image":"https:\/\/149425939.v2.pressablecdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Virginia-Riots-.jpg","body_text":"Virginia was once a solid-red state, known for its strict conservative culture ad its overall affiliation with the Bible Belt south. If anything, it seemed like it would be one of the last states to turn to the secular left. That is, until it voted for Obama in 2008.\n\nMany thought it was just a phase. After all, Indiana, also a solid Republican state, voted for Obama as well. After all, Obama was still socially conservative at the time. The trend however, continued. The Democratic Party went on to win the state in the next two presidential elections, along with the governorship and most other executive positions. In 2019, a second blue wave swept the state, removing Republicans from many local positions and giving the Democrats almost complete control over the state.\n\nMany wonder how such a solid Republican, culturally conservative state located in the south could possibly have flipped so suddenly. Many believe it is the migration of unionized government workers along with Latin American immigrants that caused the shift. Regardless, a recent election has shown that the trend may be reversing.\n\nStaunton is a small city located in the more populous northern region of Virginia. It was a part of the wave that resulting in Barack Obama winning the state in 2008. Since then, it has continued to contribute to the state turning blue.\n\nA recent election, however, seemed to show something different. In a series of local elections, Republicans were able to flip numerous city council seats and regain control over the city council. Although Democrats ultimately received more votes than they did in the previous election, Republican turnout soured to unprecedented levels. A Virginia political analyst, Chris Graham of the Augusta Free Press, had described the results as \u201cstunning almost beyond words.\u201d\n\nThese results may suggest that although the Democrats haven\u2019t lost voters to the GOP, many working class whites are being energized to vote for the GOP.\n\nThe recent policies enacted by Governor Northam are far from popular among that demographic. Anti-gun measure being pushed by the Democratic government resulted in pro-gun protestors filling the streets. Strict coronavirus lockdowns, similar to those implemented in New York and Michigan, are also angering much working class as well.\n\nOf course, one local election in one small city isn\u2019t enough to determine the political leanings of an entire state. It does, however, raise the question of the Democratic Party\u2019s popularity and the mobilization of the white working class, a demographic that is continuing to become more and more significant despite is reduction in the overall share in the population.\n\nLiked it?

It's not difficult to see through their tricks which intend to muddy the waters, deflect attention, and shift the blame to others\", Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last month.\n\nAlso in April, Yuan Zhiming, vice director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told CGTN \"there is no way\" that the coronavirus was man-made, adding, \"we have a strict regulatory regime and code of conduct of research, so we are confident\".\n\n\"It's bad when some are deliberately trying to mislead people. [\u2026] The Washington Post and several other reporters wrote about the virus coming from the Wuhan lab. They have no evidence, or knowledge, this is entirely based on speculation\", Yuan stressed.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1990,"url":"http:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2020\/05\/24\/626001\/Palestinians-Gaza-Eid-al-Fitr-Dire-Conditions","publisher":"Press TV","publish_date":"2020-05-24","author":[],"title":"Palestinians in Gaza prepare for Eid al-Fitr amid dire conditions","image":"https:\/\/cdn.presstv.com\/Photo\/2020\/5\/24\/e5883d52-2207-4821-a183-7e463e010643.jpg","body_text":"Ashraf Shannon\n\nPRESS TV, Gaza\n\nAs the holy month of Ramadan draws to an end, Palestinians in the blockaded Gaza Strip are preparing themselves to receive the Eid al-Fitr holiday under inhumane conditions.\n\nPeople traditionally head to markets to buy new clothes, gifts and sweets for their families, but many here cannot afford to do that due to harsh economic conditions.\n\nMost people have to shop for many hours trying to find affordable gifts for their loved ones.\n\nThis year the coronavirus pandemic has only made things worse.\n\nUsually during festive occasions like Eid al-Fitr, sales are high in markets around the world, but in Gaza merchants complain about poor sales.

However, the People's Republic rubbished Washington's claims about the virus' origins and expressed doubts that the so-called \"independent\" investigation pushed for by the US would be unbiased and objective. Washington's verbal attacks against China and the alleged non-transparency of its bio research have turned the spotlight on the US' own bioweapons programme.\n\nOn 13 May, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov raised the issue of US biological laboratories established overseas, most notably in the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and in former Soviet republics.\n\n\"There is a fairly dense network of these laboratories along the perimeter of the Russian Federation and near Chinese borders\", Lavrov told journalists, revealing that Moscow had signed a memorandum of understanding on biosecurity with Tajikistan and is holding similar talks with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and other neighbours in the post-Soviet space.\n\nSince 2001, Russia, China, and many other countries have advocated for the creation of a verification mechanism within the framework of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction to ensure biosafety and transparency with regard to biological research across the world. Still, the US remains \"just about the only country\" which has categorically opposed this proposal for roughly 20 years, according to the Russian foreign minister.\n\n\"This is another indication of American exceptionalism\", says Petri Krohn, Finnish political analyst and cybersecurity specialist. \"It can safely be assumed that the United States biological defence programme is 'developing pathogenic agents'. This is allowed under the Biological Weapons Convention as long as it is for defensive and not offensive purposes. Similar 'gain-of-function' (GOF) research has been done quite openly and transparently by civilian scientists\".\n\nThe analyst alleges that \"there is no bioweapons research programme in any other country with the scope of the US programme\".\n\nIn mid-April, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova did not rule out that the Americans were using such bio labs in third countries \"to develop and modify various pathogenic agents, including for military purposes\". Earlier, the issue was discussed by Secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev in his November 2019 op-ed for Rossiyskaya Gazeta: the Russian security chief signalled concerns about the Pentagon's network of overseas biological labs \"which conduct research on infectious diseases and where biological weapons can be made\".\n\nUS Domestic & Overseas Bio Experiments Raise New Questions\n\nThe Chinese are concerned about the US' domestic and overseas bio experiments, which remain no less shrouded in secrecy and non-transparent for the international community than their Russian counterparts.\n\nIn early May, the People's Liberation Army's English-language website published \"Ten questions the US needs to offer clear answers to the world\". One of these questions touches upon the US' avian influenza virus modification experiment, which was described by Science Magazine, the academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in February 2019.\n\nThe journal reported that in 2018, a US government review panel \"quietly approved\" experiments with the avian H5N1 influenza virus that were previously \"considered so dangerous that federal officials had imposed an unusual top-down moratorium on such research\" since they could potentially enable the pathogen to jump to humans.\n\nYet another question listed in the PLA list is about bio research conducted at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before and after April 2020. According to The New York Times' August 2019 report, \"safety concerns at a prominent military germ lab have led the government to shut down research involving dangerous microbes like the Ebola virus\". On 1 April 2020, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) restored the full operating capability of the USAMRIID, but the details of the shutdown remained unclear. \"What is the truth behind?\" the PLA website asks.\n\nSimilarly, the Chinese website questions the scope and purpose of US bio research overseas: \"Why does the US keep tight-lipped about it?\" it asks.\n\n\"I think these questions are legitimate to ask\", says Rob Kajiwara, a Hawaiian human rights activist. \"I'm not saying that I think COVID-19 is a weapon, but we are well aware that the US has a long history of biological and chemical warfare\".\n\nAt a press conference on 8 May, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying pointed out that while China has only two P4 (biosafety level 4) laboratories dealing with dangerous viruses, the US has 13 bio labs of that kind which are \"either in operation, under expansion or in planning\". She noted that in addition, the US has 1,495 medium containment facilities (P3), \"not including many other labs it built in territories of the former Soviet Union, like in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and in many other places around the world\".\n\nWill US be Able to Contain Hazardous Leak if It Fails to Curb COVID?\n\nAccording to Petri Krohn, the USAMRIID \"is likely to have the largest collection of naturally occurring viruses and their genomes\". He presumed that \"one of the main functions of the satellite laboratories in the former Soviet Union and around the world is to collect these viruses\".\n\nAs for the US avian flu experiments, the Finnish analyst highlights that gain-of-function (GOF) studies are believed to be highly controversial. \"The US imposed a four-year moratorium on funding for GOF work, but new research, like the H5N1 influenza study have now resumed. It is impossible to know if similar studies are done in the biological defence programme\", he says.\n\nWhat's more troubling is that given the US failure to contain COVID-19 \"because of the diverse cultures, the individualist ideology and the huge economic inequality\", the question arises as to whether the US would be able to effectively tackle a potential virus spread if it escaped either from its domestic or overseas labs, the analyst notes.\n\nChinese daily newspaper Global Times suggested that by building bio labs overseas, the US is seeking to avoid a potential leak accident, as well as legal problems and pressure from US media and anti-war groups. Citing Chinese military experts, the media outlet put forward an assumption that Beijing and Moscow could initiate an investigation of American bio labs worldwide at the UN to pressure the US into giving long-overdue answers to the questions about its secretive research.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":2019,"url":"http:\/\/widerimage.reuters.com\/story\/high-noon-in-a-coronavirus-stricken-world","publisher":"Reuters","publish_date":"","author":"['Aly Song']","title":"High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world","image":"https:\/\/photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net\/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ-ClAZyoSrCg_zZc-tFwltotnh9VEXT25oNucxpnbkoD2TKD6Zh02T26pHJxW7CzMgIddkMyFtsyDQl1jUQHWxAegJ4IRA9zhs9bbNNlzzqa","body_text":"Lockdowns to halt the spread of the coronavirus have brought an uncanny silence to some of the world's busiest places.

The county\u2019s death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sad milestone for us,\u201d county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.\n\n\u201cI wish that we could speed things up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.\u201d\n\nDespite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.\n\nThe coronavirus transmission rate in the nation\u2019s most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.\n\nStill, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.\n\nIn San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,\u201d Aparton said. If successful, the circles could be expanded to more locations, she said.\n\nIn Orange County, several coastal cities expanded their beach hours and planned to open more parking lots connected to the shoreline ahead of the holiday.\n\nSeal Beach, which initially allowed public access only Mondays through Thursdays from sunrise to sunset, is now welcoming beachgoers from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, officials said earlier this week. Some beach parking lots also reopened. Beaches are open for active use only.\n\nA few miles south, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also are allowing beach access on weekends, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Newport is now open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Huntington Beach opens an hour earlier.\n\nLaguna Beach, however, is maintaining stricter hours on Saturdays and Sundays, with its coastline closing at noon each day.\n\nWhile Los Angeles County beaches also have reopened for active use, only some parking lots are open.\n\nIn addition to the reduced transmission rate, L.A. County has seen other encouraging indicators, including a 12% decrease in its latest seven-day average of deaths per day and a 15% decrease in its most recent three-day average for hospitalizations per day, Ferrer said Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made in slowing the spread, the reduction in the average daily deaths and hospitalizations and retaining capacity in our health care system \u2014 this lets us know that the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices made by all of you are working,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a community, we\u2019ve done this together, and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, officials will continue to keep a close eye on those metrics to ensure they don\u2019t creep up as more people are out in the public due to businesses and recreation areas reopening.\n\n\u201cThrough our recovery journey, as we\u2019re all out of our homes more, it may become more difficult to slow the spread, but it is far from impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nThough experts say it\u2019s still too soon for L.A. County to move into a more aggressive phase of recovery, much of California has progressed to a point where officials feel it\u2019s safe to lift more of the state\u2019s stay-at-home order and allow more businesses to reopen.\n\nThe number of new coronavirus cases across the state declined from the previous week, and hospitalizations have dropped more than 15% from a peak six weeks ago, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.\n\nMost counties have received approval to progress more quickly through Phase 2 of the state\u2019s reopening road map \u2014 meaning they can open restaurant dining rooms and more retail businesses for in-store shopping.\n\nThe list of counties that can ramp up their reopening efforts now includes San Diego \u2014 the state\u2019s second-most populous \u2014 Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.\n\nThat comes as officials revealed that California\u2019s unemployment rate nearly tripled from mid-March to mid-April, with the state losing an unprecedented 2.3 million payroll jobs across all sectors of its economy as a result of the pandemic.\n\nApril\u2019s jobless rate skyrocketed to 15.5%, up from 5.5% a month before, sweeping past the Great Recession\u2019s peak of 12.3% a decade ago, state officials reported Friday.\n\nThe Golden State\u2019s jobless rate is higher than the nationwide rate of 14.7%, reflecting California\u2019s reliance on tourism, hospitality and entertainment businesses.\n\nStill, some local officials are urging tourists to stay away \u2014 at least for now. Multiple counties have expressed concern about people visiting and possibly bringing with them the coronavirus, especially during the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nDr. Penny Borenstein, San Luis Obispo County\u2019s health officer, asked tourists to not visit as the county reopened many shops and restaurants this week. While officials have performed \u201cspot checks\u201d with hotels to deter tourism, Borenstein said the county would cite visitors only in the case of \u201cegregious violations.\u201d\n\nRemote Alpine County urged tourists to stay away when the virus began to spread through California in March.\n\nDr. Richard Johnson, the Alpine County public health officer, said last month there\u2019s no medical care to treat visitors who fall ill with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way we would even have ground or air resources to get them out,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous assumption that you can come and look at us as a safe haven. It is an unsafe haven.\u201d\n\nCommunities in the Lake Tahoe region, which heavily depend on tourism as well, have issued reminders before the holiday weekend warning that leisure travel is not permitted.\n\nOn its website, the city of South Lake Tahoe said that while second homeowners are now welcome, other visitors are still not. Lodging will not be available to short-term renters.\n\n\u201cWe would love nothing more than to welcome everyone to Tahoe right now, but that\u2019s not the safest way to bring people back to South Lake,\u201d City Manager Joe Irvin said in a statement. \u201cWe need to be responsible and make sure we are doing our part to keep our neighbors safe and Tahoe safe while adhering to the governor\u2019s stay at home orders.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n(Bierman reported from Washington.
