(1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family.\n\nCorona Virus\n\nWe are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not very virulent. This type of virus is found very commonly in animals. Some now believe that the virus for MERS, SARS and now the Wuhan Virus has somehow unnaturally been transmitted to humans, and humans have now become another vector for this infection.\n\nWestern Medicine, Louis Pasteur and Antoine B\u00e9champ\n\nWe have developed Western medicine primarily by following the teaching of French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and the Germ Theory of Disease. Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine B\u00e9champ a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid\/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes. This disease theories of Pasteur have led us to the doctrines of virology and immunology. This evolution began before we learned anything about vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. (2)\n\nVaccinate!\n\nWestern medicine is now leaving the world of antibiotics. Antibiotics are failing and have served to create more pathogens that are resistant to antibiotic treatments. Western medicine is now embracing vaccination. And why not? There are untold numbers of microbes and 7.8 billion people on earth to experiment upon. Pharmaceutical companies have more and more vaccines in their pipelines. All they must do is to convince us and our governments that their vaccines are the only thing that saves us from vast epidemics, severe illness and probably death. And not a surprise the Corona virus has already been patented. Even at best, this season\u2019s flu vaccines have already proven to be 70% ineffective. The promise of herd immunity does not hold up with vaccinated populations. (3)\n\nNine Months to a Corona Vaccine\n\nOn January 23, 2020 the company Moderna, Inc announced that it is partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (4) to develop a vaccine to prevent infection by the corona virus within the next 9 months. They promise new technology to address this life-threatening epidemic. Sound good? It might be if vaccinations worked. It might be if organisms didn\u2019t rapidly mutate to new forms as they pass through their vectors. It might be if vaccines didn\u2019t also depend on heavy metals to aggravate the immune system. It might be if animal and human DNA from the viral growth medium weren\u2019t injected into the body without any clue for the long-term consequences. Vaccines do not work.\n\nHow is the Flu Deadly?\n\nMost of us have experienced the respiratory illness that is characterized as the flu at some point in our lives. Temperatures rise as it is part of the body\u2019s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let\u2019s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.\n\nBack to Antoine B\u00e9champ\n\nThis is the other option. We can choose to help our body\u2019s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the \u201cfriendly fire\u201d. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.\n\nBasic and Free (or almost)\n\nWash your hands. We can\u2019t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks. (5)\n\nPlain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you. It\u2019s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies. (6)\n\nThe So-Called Flu Season.\n\n\u201c...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400,000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.\u201d Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook.\n\nVitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng\/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. (7)\n\nLinus Pauling and Vitamin C\n\nLinus Pauling\u2019s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. (8)\n\nHydrocortisone\n\nDr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80\u2019s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone. Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid. (9)\n\nOzone\n\nAntibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don\u2019t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces. Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone. (10)\n\nTo Be Continued\n\nWe are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don\u2019t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.\n\nDon't forget to read the companion article: https:\/\/worldhealth.net\/news\/2020-coronavirus-report\/","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":22,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/next-frontier-mitochondrial-medical-applications-2020\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-02-19","author":[],"title":"The Next Frontier of Mitochondrial Medical Applications (2020)","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/170314_mitochondria.jpg","body_text":"Becoming the world's most advanced and largest professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader is the vision of most biotech companies in the field of mitochondria and mitochondrial research, and preventive medicine.\n\nMitochondrial disorders are multi-systemic and commonplace, and it belongs to a prevalent category of inherited neurometabolic diseases (prevalence: 1:4300). Such diseases are clinically, genetically and chemically heterogeneous so that recognition and diagnosis are frequently difficult, but thankfully, for most of the patients, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to great improvements in genetic diagnosis. Due to the variability of features and nature of the biochemical or genetic defects, early referral to a specialized center is recommended because improved diagnostics and NGS use have enabled an earlier diagnosis for many, as well as sometimes early instigation of effective therapy and precision medicine.\n\nThere is currently no cure available for the majority of such conditions, and clinical care is largely restricted to negating the complications of these diseases or assisting prevention through prenatal testing, mitochondrial donation therapy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. As such, the limited options and lack of curative treatment options have created more opportunities and investments into individual therapy trials, focused on optimizing oxidative phosphorylation and improving antioxidant capacity. In essence, a combination of vitamins, including coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), thiamine and riboflavin in addition to other regenerative medicinal approaches in the telomeres, stem cell and senescent cells is recommended. As of February 2020, more than 250 trials are ongoing worldwide investigating potential therapeutic approaches.\n\nMitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MAB or MitoBioMed) is one such company conducting such trials and aims to fulfil this mission by forming a strong competitive team with our medical institutions and customers, as a long-term and trusted technology and capacity provider in the global mitochondrial \/cell therapy industry. Scientists are working night and day, racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus. An East-meets-West combination of medicines is now suggested to be the recommended course.\n\nWith the advent of an ageing society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to ageing and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.\n\nMAB also establishes a series of training and certification mechanisms for medical personnel (such as doctors) and cooperates with medical institutions and academic institutions around the world. This makes it a prime candidate for impact investing towards sustainability development, in alignment with the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe Company along with other biotech companies in the field have developed many product lines, including mitochondrial activated stem cells (Mitocell), mitochondrial biologics (Mitobio), mitochondrial activated immune cells (MAKcell), mitochondrial function tests (Mitoscan), mitochondrial aesthetic medicine, mitochondrial cell bank(Mitobank), mitochondria activated herbal extracts (Dynamito), mitochondria activated health food (Mitofood), mitochondria activation culture medium(Stemoto), etc., Mitocell, Mitobio, and MAKcell are all ready for the next phase of clinical development. Other products are cooperatively sold in the fields of preventive health care, medical beauty, cell culture, detection and analysis. These products have proven safety and effectiveness in preliminary studies.\n\nFurthermore, Mitochondria for stem cell therapy is another frontier for regenerative medicine. Stem cells are primitive and unspecialized cells, they are a type of cells that are not sufficiently differentiated and have the potential to regenerate various tissues and organs. In medicine, stem cells have long been considered to have potential for medical applications because of their strong potential for treating physical damage caused by disease, aging, genetic factors or trauma. In international research, mitochondria are an important factor affecting the quality of stem cells. By analyzing the function of mitochondria in stem cells as a way to identify the quality of cells, it provides a scientific way to identify cell quality. The company's research is to improve the quality and function of stem cells by screening and increasing mitochondrial function. Stem cells activated by mitochondria have better therapeutic effects. Our company's mitochondrial activated stem cells have also been proven to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Osteoarthritis, Multiple System Atrophy\n\nLastly, in addition to the aforementioned products in the market, mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT) work to prevent transmitting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases from mother to the next generation. Such diseases vary in presentation and severity. The goal of MRT is to prevent the transmission of such diseases by creating an embryo with nuclear DNA (nDNA) from the intended mother and mtDNA from a woman with non-pathogenic mtDNA through modification of either an oocyte (egg) or zygote (fertilized egg). This will help alleviate common symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle weakness, vision loss, and heart problems, which in combination lead to an increase of morbidity and in some cases premature death. While research continues to be conducted, if effective, MRT could satisfy the desire of women seeking to have a genetically related child without the risk of passing on mtDNA disease.\n\nIn the US alone, mitochondrial diseases affect around 1 in 5,000 individuals. It is also estimated that 1,000-4,000 children are born with a mitochondrial disease every year Therefore, there is a direct need to focus on building a world class professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader, with a purpose in creating affordable healthcare and biotech leadership in preventative medicine. It also creates a space for the community of social impact investing to be more deeply involved in health and wellbeing.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":54,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/11\/814603337\/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-may-impact-the-2020-census","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-03-11","author":"['Hansi Lo Wang']","title":"Coronavirus Is Making It Even Harder For The Census To Count Every U.S. Resident","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/03\/14\/gettyimages-1206596153_wide-0c41996b70d7ba1ced6c6ae4ee6d259d7398faba.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Coronavirus Is Making It Even Harder For The Census To Count Every U.S. Resident\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yuki Iwamura\/Bloomberg via Getty Images Yuki Iwamura\/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nUpdated March 15 at 6:47 p.m. ET\n\nAlready saddled with cybersecurity risks, hiring challenges and wavering public trust, the 2020 census now must contend with a growing public health crisis.\n\nNPR has learned that at least one U.S. Census Bureau employee \u2014 who was recently hired as a supervisor for a group of door knockers, spokesperson Michael Cook says, and has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau \u2014 has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been quarantined.\n\n\"The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,\" Cook said in an email.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus pandemic, the bureau has decided to delay starting its early round of door-knocking by census workers in college towns to April 23. The bureau is also waiting until early April, instead of late March, to begin its outreach effort to send out representatives with computer tablets to help people submit their census responses online. That program, which is expected to cost at least $100 million, is designed to target people in high-traffic locations, from public transit hubs to grocery stores.\n\nThe uncertain timeline of the coronavirus outbreaks, however, could further complicate the constitutionally mandated head count of every U.S. resident. Major disruptions could derail the Census Bureau from gathering accurate numbers used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets for the next 10 years. The data also guide the redrawing of voting districts and the distribution of as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for healthcare, schools, roads and other public services to local communities.\n\nHere's what to look for as the count \u2014 scheduled to continue through July \u2014 rolls out around the country:\n\nThe \"safest\" way to do the census is on your own\n\nWithout leaving home, you can take about 10 minutes now to submit a response on behalf of your household \u2014 either online at my2020census.gov or over the phone.\n\nIf you prefer paper, all households that haven't responded by early April are expected to receive a physical questionnaire in the mail. Some households in areas with low Internet subscription rates, and communities with higher shares of residents over age 65, are set to receive paper forms by March 20.\n\nThose would be \"the safest\" ways to do the census because they involve little to no person-to-person contact, says John Thompson, a former Census Bureau director who left the agency in 2017.\n\nBut the key is to turn in your household's legally required response as soon as possible, Thompson adds. Otherwise, your home address is likely to be added to the list of places for census workers to visit in person beginning May 13. College students living off-campus may get a door knock starting April 23, instead of April 9, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR.\n\n\"It is critical that households understand that self-responding to the census can help alleviate additional burdens to the Bureau, brought on by COVID-19,\" Arturo Vargas, a longtime census advocate and CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, says in a written statement.\n\nAs of Saturday, 3 million households have submitted an online response to my2020census.gov since it was soft-launched on Monday, according to Cook.\n\n\"The Census Bureau is ready for you to do the same,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, said in a written statement. \"If you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.\"\n\nCan the census be delayed?\n\nThe Census Bureau has been planning to conduct the national head count through July 31. But this week, some Democratic members of Congress have been calling for the counting to be extended.\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Adriano Espaillat \u2014 both of New York \u2014 along with 10 other Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, are urging the bureau to continue the count for an additional three months through October. A separate group of New York lawmakers led by Rep. Yvette Clarke wants the bureau to extend counting at least through September \"due to the social disruption caused by COVID-19.\"\n\n\"Social distancing will make enumeration practically impossible during the current allotted time frame,\" Clarke and the other lawmakers wrote in a letter to Ross.\n\nIn response to the coronavirus, some tribal nations are increasing their security by limiting who can enter tribal territories, according to Lycia Maddocks, vice president of external affairs at the National Congress of American Indians.\n\n\"Some nations actually have physical guard stands where they can check to see if you're a tribal citizen,\" Maddocks, a citizen of the Quechan Tribe, said during a news conference Friday.\n\nThat could exacerbate the undercount of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who had the highest net undercount rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the 2010 census, according to the bureau's estimates. The delivery of census mailings could be delayed and census workers may not be able to travel in Indian Country, where there is often limited or no high-speed Internet service.\n\nThe bureau told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week it's watching to see how many households respond on their own before deciding whether to continue counting past July. The bureau has said it is prepared to delay sending out census workers to specific areas where there is an outbreak.\n\nStill, the bureau is under pressure to meet a critical deadline: Under federal law, the Census Bureau is required to deliver the latest population counts of each state to the president by Dec. 31.\n\n\"If they have to delay too long, then they would have to work with the Congress and see if they would pass a new law to extend the deadline for the census,\" Thompson, the former bureau director, says.\n\nAsked by NPR on Thursday whether the bureau is considering making such a request to Congress, the bureau's current director, Steven Dillingham, said: \"I wouldn't take anything off the table, but that's the first mention I've heard of that possibility.\"\n\nWill the Census Bureau be able to hire and protect a half-million census workers?\n\nThe bureau is currently trying to hire and train as many as a half-million census workers to follow up with households that don't fill out a form themselves. These workers are critical to the bureau's strategy for making sure historically undercounted groups \u2014 including communities of color, rural residents and immigrants \u2014 are included in the country's population count.\n\n\"Historically, Black and Latino households, among others, have lower self-response rates, which means the Census Bureau needs enough manpower in the field to collect census information in-person in these communities,\" Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who once served as the staff director of the former House oversight subcommittee for the census, says in an email.\n\nThe bureau told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week there has not been a significant drop in staffing since the outbreak.\n\nBut Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR that the bureau learned on Friday that the newly hired census field supervisor, who is now quarantined, tested positive for COVID-19. While that employee, who was expected to be based from home, has not engaged with the public on behalf of the bureau, Cooks says the individual interacted with other recently hired census workers and trainers during a new employee training session.\n\n\"The very limited number of employees with whom the individual was in contact have been notified by public health authorities and are in self-quarantine,\" Cook says in a written statement to NPR. \"We will continue to provide support to any and all impacted employees and follow all public health authority guidance.\"\n\nCooks adds the bureau is not aware of any \"work-related public activity\" by the employees in self-quarantine.\n\nThe bureau told lawmakers that it's planning to conduct more online training sessions and give workers safety equipment. Cook tells NPR the bureau is working on including social distancing techniques in trainings for door knockers, known as enumerators, and other on-the-ground census workers. Those who feel sick are \"strongly encouraged\" to stay at home, Cook adds. Enumerators do not get sick leave, but Cook says the bureau is looking into ways to pay them for a work-related injury or illness.\n\nStill, on Friday, the Commerce Department Office of Inspector General, an internal watchdog group for the bureau, asked the agency to provide more details by March 20 on how it plans to conduct the count at \"a time of unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty.\"\n\nThompson, the former bureau director, worries that trying to convince people to work for the census could be a \"particularly sensitive issue,\" especially among retirees over the age of 60. Given the low employment rate, they've been among the groups targeted by the bureau's recruiting efforts. But now they are at higher risk than younger age groups of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.\n\nKevin Dowd, 62, a retired accountant who applied for a 2020 census job and lives near Milford, Pa., says he recently decided not to attend a training session for prospective enumerators because he was worried about getting sick.\n\n\"How many people would be in how big a room?\" Dowd says he wondered. \"Many people have come back from vacation, from places that have more cases, and so I decided that I didn't need the $16 an hour.\"\n\nHow will the homeless population be counted?\n\nThe bureau may decide next week to push back its schedule for counting people experiencing homelessness who are staying in shelters, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR. That count is currently set for March 30 through April 1.\n\nThe agency is also evaluating whether to delay its April 1 count of homeless people living outside of shelters and in public parks, under bridges and other outdoor locations.\n\nShelters can choose to have a census worker visit their facility to interview residents and other people who use their services. But rising health concerns about COVID-19 raise two potential challenges, Thompson, the former bureau director, says.\n\n\"Workers could be reluctant to go to a place where the homeless receive services,\" Thompson says. \"The places could be reluctant to let people in.\"\n\nCook says the agency is trying to contact facilities that had planned for an in-person count to ask whether they can switch to paper forms instead.\n\nIn New York City \u2014 home to the country's largest homeless population \u2014 census workers are not expected to visit city-owned shelters because the local department of social services is transferring records about the shelters' residents to the Census Bureau, Julie Menin, the city's census director, tells NPR.\n\n\"What this really does is ensures that every single homeless person in New York City is properly counted,\" Menin says. \"We don't want anyone to be overlooked. We don't want anyone to be invisible.\"\n\nHow will college students, nursing home residents and prisoners be counted?\n\nCook says the bureau is trying to encourage 68,000 nursing homes, prisons and other group living facilities, excluding college dorms, to send in information about their residents online or by paper, rather than waiting for a census worker to do in-person interviews starting in early April.\n\nClose to 12,900 dorms had chosen earlier this year to have the bureau drop off paper forms for each of their student residents to fill out individually. Given the chaotic situation at many campuses, however, the bureau is reaching out to the administrators to see if they want to change those plans.\n\nThe canceling of in-person classes and dorm closures at a growing number of colleges and universities have also raised concerns about whether students who live away from their families' homes will be counted in the right place.\n\nIn general, the bureau says all U.S. residents should be counted where they usually live and sleep, even if they're away on Census Day (April 1). This week, the bureau confirmed to NPR that students who have left their college town because of coronavirus should still use their address at school when filling out a census form.\n\nBut it's not clear if that guidance will reach students who have scattered around the country, some scrambling to find last-minute housing. In a letter to the Department of Education, the bureau suggests that schools contact their students who usually live off-campus about how to get counted on their own using my2020census.gov.\n\nHow will community groups help promote the census?\n\nFor decades, the bureau has relied on parades, street festivals and worship services as opportunities for local community leaders to encourage participation in the census.\n\n\"The person-to-person contact can be much more effective than a letter in the mail,\" says Nancy Potok, a former deputy director at the Census Bureau who recently retired as the chief statistician of the U.S.\n\nBut the coronavirus is forcing census advocates to pivot away from in-person outreach activities. John Park, executive director of the MinKwon Center \u2014 a community group based in Queens, N.Y. \u2014 says his organization has been scaling down door-knocking and ramping up texting and phone-banking to encourage households to fill out the census on their own.\n\n\"We've created multi-lingual T-shirts with QR codes that link to the census self-response URL, which will let people keep their distance but still access the survey,\" Park says in an email.\n\nStill, for now, the bureau plans to move forward with its outreach efforts through its \"Mobile Questionnaire Assistance\" program after delaying the initial rollout from March 30 to April 6, Cook tells NPR. By April 13, census workers are expected to fan out with computer tablets around the country in areas with low census response rates to help people get counted online.\n\nWill the coronavirus shut down census call centers and processing centers for paper forms?\n\nWhile the bureau hopes most households use my2020census.gov, it's still collecting paper questionnaires, which are a critical backstop in case of any major technical breakdowns with the online census form.\n\n\"One area that people tend to overlook is the importance of the processing centers,\" Potok, the former deputy director of the bureau, says about the two data processing centers in Phoenix and Jeffersonville, Ind., which is across the river from Louisville, Ky., for the 2020 census. \"People need to be there to check in the questionnaires.\"\n\nThe centers can receive, separate and scan as many as 30 million paper questionnaires for the 2020 census, according to the bureau's plan for its paper data capture operation. Processing those paper forms will help the bureau figure out where they need to send workers to follow up with unresponsive households.\n\nDeb Stempowski, an assistant director at the bureau who's in charge of operations and schedules for the 2020 census, says if there are any interruptions at one of the sites, the other center could pick up the extra work. Stempowski adds the bureau is tracking paper forms that are mailed back as soon as they enter the mail stream, and the agency is prepared to ask employees to work longer shifts or on the weekends if needed.\n\n\"I don't believe that we have an issue if we have one or two people who can no longer support the work in one of the centers,\" Stempowski said.\n\nStill, there is a risk of both facilities having to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe pandemic could also complicate staffing at the call centers that are receiving census responses over the phone and answering questions about the count in 13 languages. The 10 census questionnaire assistance centers are located in Tempe, Ariz.; Pueblo, Colo.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Tamarac, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; New York City; Blytheville, S.C.; El Paso, Texas; Irving, Texas; and Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\"We have a significant contingency budget in place, which enables us to move offices if needed,\" Cook tells NPR, referring to a $2 billion budget set aside for 2020 census emergencies.\n\nWill the coronavirus force the bureau to rely more heavily on government records to fill in missing information?\n\nIf the outbreak ultimately makes it impossible to gather self-reported information from certain households in time, the bureau may have to turn to alternatives to fill in the gaps, including a cache of existing government records from other federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n\"It is possible that administrative records will have to enumerate a much larger share of the population as the virus spreads,\" Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director who oversaw the 2000 count, wrote in an op-ed this week in The New York Times.\n\nSome critics worry that relying on records to complete demographic profiles of certain households may not produce accurate census information.\n\n\"We find these records work well in matching records for the White and higher-income populations but racial\/ethnic minorities, lower-income persons, and other HTC populations are likely to be missed,\" members of a working group of Census Bureau researchers and advisors to the bureau wrote in a 2016 report.\n\nBefore the outbreak, the bureau estimated that about 7.9 million households \u2014 or just over 5% of the around 147 million home addresses it's planning to include in the 2020 census \u2014 will be counted using administrative records, according to a regulatory document filed in January with the White House's Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBureau officials said in the document that if the bureau \"does not have confidence\" in the records for an unresponsive household because of missing or inconsistent data, they plan to continue sending census workers to knock on the door.\n\nAccording to the bureau's plans, workers are generally supposed to try to gather information in person in up to six days in total. At a time of outbreak, however, it's hard to say how many visits will actually be possible later this year.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":73,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/13\/21179055\/instagram-augmented-reality-effect-coronavirus-covid-19","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-03-13","author":"['Ashley Carman']","title":"Instagram cracks down on coronavirus AR effects","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/AhEDh8cXLzPzD8FmGa8EbJmzzbs=\/0x146:2040x1214\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19228500\/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.jpg","body_text":"Instagram is attempting to stop the spread of misinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic that\u2019s surfacing through its augmented reality effects.

As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.\n\nNASA has its own internal \u201cresponse framework\u201d for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers \u2014 Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center \u2014 are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows \u201cmission-essential\u201d personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.\n\nNASA has its own internal \u201cresponse framework\u201d for how to deal with the pandemic\n\nNASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency\u2019s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. \u201cThe health and safety of NASA\u2019s workforce is the agency\u2019s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,\u201d a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.\n\nBut as more workers at JSC stay home, they\u2019re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they\u2019ll join three people already in orbit.\n\nThat launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn\u2019t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country\u2019s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.\n\nOf course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called \u201chealth stabilization,\u201d according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it \u201cwill continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners\u201d if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia\u2019s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.\n\nAll astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine\n\nOnce this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA\u2019s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.\n\nSpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company\u2019s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX\u2019s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company\u2019s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.\n\nOf course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe\u2019s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":89,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/common-drugs-may-confer-higher-risk-covid-19\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-03-17","author":[],"title":"Common Drugs That May Confer Higher Risk For COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_131768889.jpeg","body_text":"It is known [1] that coronaviruses bind to target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2.

Official letters with instructions on how to participate in the national head count are expected to arrive at most homes by Friday.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that it is delaying deploying door knockers to college towns until April 23 and waiting until early April to start sending out census workers with computer tablets to help people complete online forms.\n\nStill, there has been a lot of uncertainty about how the bureau plans to protect early rounds of census workers expected to go door to door to count residents in remote parts of Alaska and Maine, and in some American Indian tribal territories. Other workers were set to leave paper questionnaires in Puerto Rico and other places recovering from natural disasters. The bureau had also been preparing to conduct an in-person count of people experiencing homelessness.\n\nRecently hired enumerators, also known as door knockers, and other field staff have been gathering around the country for training sessions. The bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that at least one employee, who was hired to be a census field supervisor, has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in quarantine.\n\n\"The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,\" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, said in a follow-up email on Sunday.\n\nWhile that employee has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau, the census field supervisor was in contact with a \"very limited number of employees\" at a training session, and all of them are in self-quarantine, Cook said on Saturday.\n\nThe latest state population counts are due to the president by December 31, according to federal law.\n\nThe numbers of every person living in the U.S. determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for the next decade. They also guide how as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other public services are divided up among local communities.\n\nIn the written statement, Dillingham said that as of Wednesday morning, more than 11 million households have submitted a census response on their own through the Internet since March 9, when the online form at my2020census.gov was soft launched.\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who helps oversee the 2020 census as the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, says she hopes more households will continue to find ways to respond to the census during the temporary pause in field operations.\n\n\"Every American should know that this does not affect your ability to self-respond,\" Maloney said in a statement. \"By responding now, you will ensure that the Census Bureau does not need to send a census worker to your door.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":112,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/19\/21186634\/bill-de-blasio-elon-musk-ventilator-shortage-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-03-19","author":"['Sean OKane']","title":"NYC mayor asks Elon Musk to manufacture ventilators for COVID-19 patients","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/2MXzfuarLpV3lmt4LiSnGX4c3a8=\/0x322:4500x2678\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19818364\/1206290114.jpg.jpg","body_text":"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted on Wednesday night that he\u2019s willing to have his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, make crucial ventilators to help patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

The only reason it might not seem like there isn\u2019t one currently in the US is that we haven\u2019t yet exhausted the short supply. And while President Trump said he\u2019s willing to invoke the wartime \u201cDefense Production Act\u201d on Wednesday to address the shortage, he tweeted later in the day that he\u2019d only do so in a \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d\n\n@elonmusk New York City is buying!\n\n\n\nOur country is facing a drastic shortage and we need ventilators ASAP \u2014 we will need thousands in this city over the next few weeks.

Just yesterday, General Motors said CEO Mary Barra told the White House she was looking into making ventilators at her company\u2019s factories. Ford followed suit soon after. Musk is alone among those peers in underplaying the pandemic, though. He called the \u201cpanic\u201d over the coronavirus \u201cdumb,\u201d compared the lethality of COVID-19 to car crashes (which are not contagious), and finished his Twitter conversation about ventilators on Wednesday night by again saying he thinks the \u201cpanic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn\u2019t happened already.\u201d\n\nAs for how Musk might approach making ventilators, the entrepreneur said they are \u201cnot difficult\u201d to make. He pointed to how Tesla makes \u201ccars with sophisticated hvac systems,\u201d and SpaceX \u201cmakes spacecraft with life support systems,\u201d though he admitted it would take some time to spin up any real production effort. Where they would be built is another question; Tesla is currently locked in a back-and-forth with local authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area over whether the company should suspend production of electric cars amid a shelter-in-place order, and it could run into a similar issue at its Gigafactory in Nevada now that the state has issued a similar directive.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s gutting of critical government offices, combined with his apparent refusal to take the threat of the novel coronavirus seriously in the early weeks, has left states and local governments overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. At the same time, Trump\u2019s administration has leaned hard on the private sector to pick up the slack in ways that have repeatedly surprised those companies. He claimed Google was developing a nationwide screening website that will help people learn if and how they should get tested for COVID-19 and said retail companies would offer up parking lot space for testing sites \u2014 despite neither of those claims having been completely true before they were uttered aloud.\n\nStill, companies are putting themselves into the mix. Amazon announced it will hire 100,000 workers worldwide and is bumping up its hourly pay to both help with a delivery crunch and provide jobs for people who are now out of work. Gaming company Razer has said it will help make masks, too.\n\nMusk is no stranger to inserting himself into an international crisis. He famously spun up an effort at SpaceX in 2018 to create a submersible vessel to help rescue the soccer team trapped in a cave network in Thailand. If Musk really wants to help out this time around, it looks like he already has one taker in New York City. It almost certainly won\u2019t be the last, either.\n\nUpdate March 19th, 1:46PM ET: Added Elon Musk\u2019s response to Bill de Blasio\u2019s office.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":114,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/20\/21188143\/bandcamp-waives-sales-fees-artists-affected-coronavirus-pandemic","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-03-20","author":"['Dani Deahl']","title":"Bandcamp is waiving sales fees today to help artists impacted by coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/XiMbz1vzsHdqA0-D_QzleW_J4As=\/0x6:1600x844\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19820975\/0018986933_0.jpg","body_text":"Online music marketplace Bandcamp is waiving its revenue share on sales today in order to help musicians who are impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Buying music on Bandcamp is a way to quickly and more directly put money in a musician\u2019s pocket, as there are often fewer middlemen and funds are deposited within 24\u201348 hours of a purchase. Bandcamp\u2019s structure is also unique in that it allows for flexible payments. Artists set a minimum purchase price for music and physical goods, but people are welcome to add more on top when they buy as a tip or gift.\n\nBandcamp is used by hundreds of thousands of artists, more than 3,000 labels, and has an inventory of over 800,000 unique physical products. The platform says that fans have paid artists $470 million through the platform since it launched in 2007, with $10.2 million paid out in the last 30 days.\n\n\u201cFor many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not,\u201d says Bandcamp co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond. \u201cStill, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come.\u201d\n\nThe Verge noted this yesterday in speaking with musicians looking to Twitch to recoup lost tour funds.

At times, he\u2019s refused to sleep in the bunk bed he\u2019d begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lucca brought me \u201clunch\u201d \u2014 two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned.

J.B. Pritzker said at a briefing Saturday a \u201cdeluge\u201d of applications for unemployment continue to flood the department.\n\nUnder the new federal law, funding will flow to states to help cover gig workers newly eligible for unemployment compensation; 13 weeks of extra payments will be added to the 26 already allowed and, according to Section 2104 of the legislation, there will also be an \u201cemergency increase in unemployment compensation\u201d of \u201can additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. \u201c\n\nTens of thousands of workers across Illinois have been temporarily out of work since the outbreak began forcing businesses to close. Last week, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to stop serving dine-in customers, and on Saturday, he issued a stay-at-home order leaving just \u201cessential\u201d businesses in operation.\n\nRelated Frustration mounts as state scrambles to keep up with jobless benefits claims\n\nA message to our readers We\u2019re keeping essential coronavirus news that you need to know accessible for free here at suntimes.com.

Subscribe\n\nThe result is countless people are now out of work and being forced into the state\u2019s unemployment system. Illinois alone saw more than 64,000 new claims for unemployment benefits from March 16-18, and an unprecedented 130,000-plus claims so far this month, officials said.\n\nTo handle this massive influx of new applications, IDES announced it recently adopted emergency rules for who qualifies for unemployment insurance.\n\nUnemployment insurance (UI) basics\n\nIn normal times, UI provides temporary income via federal funds to Illinois residents who are unemployed but able, available and actively seeking work each week.\n\nThe amount residents can receive depends on their usual pay rate with benefits ranging from $51 to $580 per week. Those approved can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period.\n\nThe new emergency rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic open up UI to a much larger group of workers. This means many people who wouldn\u2019t typically qualify for UI can get benefits during the state of emergency.\n\nAdditionally, under the federal relief bill passed last week, Illinois residents receiving unemployment benefits will receive an additional $600 weekly above what they would receive in regular unemployment benefits until July 31, 2020.\n\nWorkers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19 can get UI\n\nIllinois residents who are temporarily out of work because their employer has closed due to the coronavirus can qualify for UI if they meet all the other basic requirements.\n\nThe state isn\u2019t expecting anyone to go out looking for a new job during a stay-at-home order: as long as applicants are prepared to return to their job as soon as the employer reopens, they\u2019ll be considered to be actively seeking work and will qualify.\n\nUnder emergency rules, these workers will not have to register with the employment service.\n\nWorkers who quit due to COVID-19 fears cannot get UI\n\nUnlike Illinois residents who are temporarily laid off by their employers\u2019 closure, workers who voluntarily leave their job over concerns of the coronavirus will not be eligible for UI. The agency says \u201can individual generally has a duty to make a reasonable effort to work with his or her employer to resolve whatever issues have caused the individual to consider quitting.\u201d\n\nParents who leave work due to a child\u2019s school closure can get UI\n\nWith all Illinois schools closed through at least the end of April, and possibly the remainder of the school year, parents who voluntarily leave work to care for their child can qualify for UI because they \u201ccould be considered as unemployed through no fault of\u201d their own.\n\nYou must still meet all of the other standard requirements, and unlike workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19, parents who voluntarily leave work must be registered with the employment service.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s already exhausted UI rights may be eligible for additional benefits\n\nWith the passing of the federal relief bill in Congress last week, IDES announced Tuesday that some individuals who have already received their full 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits in the last one-year period will be eligible for additional benefits during the crisis.\n\n\u201cIf you have exhausted your benefits, or you are close to exhausting your benefits, we are finalizing the process to continue benefits under the stimulus package,\u201d IDES said in a Q-and-A posted on its website. The agency says more information will be issued once guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nHere\u2019s how to apply for UI\n\nYou can call the Illinois Department of Economic Services at (800) 244-5631 or 866-488-4016 (TTY), but users are urged to file claims via the IDES website. And do not go in person: as of March 19, IDES offices are closed to the public until further notice.\n\nTo accommodate the massive surge of applicants, the agency has staggered times for people to submit claims:\n\nPeople whose last names start with the letters A through M are asked to file claims online on Sundays, Tuesdays or Thursdays.\n\nLast names beginning with N through Z should file claims on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.\n\nSaturdays are set aside for people who aren\u2019t able to file during their allotted time, officials said.\n\nPeople without internet access should call in according to the following schedule, per IDES:","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":143,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/24\/820598340\/afro-funk-saxophonist-manu-dibango-dies-of-covid-19","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-03-24","author":"['Anastasia Tsioulcas']","title":"Afro-Funk Saxophonist Manu Dibango Dies Of COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/03\/24\/gettyimages-541535433_wide-24b809d0152ae9b53bedd5980f953a1078169403.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Afro-Funk Saxophonist Manu Dibango Dies Of COVID-19\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ullstein Bild\/Getty Images Ullstein Bild\/Getty Images\n\nOne of the pioneers of Afro-funk music, the saxophonist Manu Dibango, has died of COVID-19. He was 86 years old, and died in Paris. Internationally, he was best known for his 1972 song \"Soul Makossa,\" though his entire oeuvre could have been the soundtrack to a cooler 1970s than most people lived. But that one, funk-drenched hit, lit by Dibango's burning saxophone, went on to influence the sound of American disco \u2014 and its hooky spoken intro helped power songs by Michael Jackson and Rihanna.\n\nDibango's death was announced on social media by his representatives, who said that he died Tuesday at age 86 due to the coronavirus; they had also announced last Wednesday that he had been hospitalized due to the pandemic. A public memorial will be \"organized when possible,\" the announcement said.\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Soul Makossa\" became a hit in New York after DJ David Mancuso started playing the track at his Loft parties.\n\nDibango was born December 12, 1933, in the port city of Douala, Cameroon; his father was a civil servant. His parents' marriage was unusual for the time: His mother came from the Douala ethnic group, and his father from the Yabassi, and he later said that he never felt quite at home identifying with either.\n\nWhen he was 15 years old, his parents sent him to study in France, so that he could return as an administrator, like his father. He paid for his initial rent in Europe with three kilograms of coffee from home \u2014 a fact that provided the title for his autobiography. He had been sent abroad to study philosophy, but instead fell in love with American jazz. As he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1990, his parents were extremely upset by his decision to pursue music professionally, and cut him off.\n\nWhile still in France, he began playing in bands \u2014 piano, mandolin, vibraphone and, soon enough, saxophone. Dibango made his way to Brussels, where he met one of Africa's greatest bandleaders, Joseph \"Grand Kall\u00e9\" Kabasele, a master of Congolese rumba. This was a time of exciting, super-danceable musical experimentation -- Congolese rumba was a blend of American jazz, Cuban rhythms and buoyant African sounds. The genre-bending, free-wheeling music became part of the roots of Dibango's own creativity as a bandleader.\n\nKabasele hired Dibango to play saxophone in his group, African Jazz. As part of that group, Dibango traveled to what was then Congo, now Zaire, to spend a month with the band. Instead, he stayed two years and opened his own club, Tam-Tam, in what was then the city of L\u00e9opoldville, now Kinshasa.\n\nDibango then moved to France where, in the late 1960s and early '70s, he began to forge a career as a significant solo artist. But \"Soul Makossa\" skyrocketed him to international fame.\n\nIn the years after the success of \"Soul Makossa,\" he collaborated with many famed international artists, including Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock, Don Cherry, Sly and Robbie, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, King Sunny Ad\u00e9, Youssou N'Dour, Hugh Masekela and Fela Kuti.\n\n\"Soul Makossa\" was originally the B-side for a Dibango 45 RPM single; its refrain was something of a branding exercise for \"makossa,\" the funky, jazz-tinged dance genre that Dibango pioneered. (Kossa means \"dance\" in Douala, his mother's native language.)\n\nIn 1982, Michael Jackson picked up a version of a line that Dibango declaimed on \"Soul Makossa\" \u2014 which Jackson sang as \"mama-se, mama-sa, ma-makossa\" \u2014 on his song \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' \" from the album Thriller.\n\nThe Cameroonian musician sued the American megastar; Jackson settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. In 2007, Rihanna sampled Jackson's version of the \"Soul Makossa\" line on her song \"Don't Stop the Music.\" (Jackson had given her permission, but not Dibango.) Two years later, Dibango sued Jackson again, as well as Rihanna in France; that time, his case failed, due to the earlier settlement.\n\nPublicly, Dibango did not dwell on his wranglings with Jackson; as he wryly told Fresh Air in 1990, \"I think he wanted to say hello to Africa somewhere.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":155,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/new-york-hospitals-utilizing-vitamin-c\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-03-25","author":[],"title":"New York Hospitals Utilizing Vitamin C","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_225041107.jpeg","body_text":"New York State\u2019s largest hospital system is giving high dose intravenous vitamin C treatments to COVID-19 patients based on reports from China of the approach helping patients there, according to the Post.\n\nPulmonologist and critical care specialists Dr. Andrew G. Weber, who is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, is reporting that his COVID-19 intensive care patients are immediately receiving 1,500 mgs of vitamin C intravenously and are re-administered the exact amounts 3-4 times per day.\n\nEach dose is more than 16 times the national recommended guideline allowances of 90 mg for adult men and 75 mg for adult women. This approach is based on experimental treatments and small studies involving coronavirus patients in Shanghai, China; a hospital even made a release about it.\n\nThe official statement from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:\n\n\u201cOn the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,\u201d said Weber. \u201cIt helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it\u2019s not a sexy drug.\u201d\n\nJason Molinet who is spokesperson for Northwell states that vitamin C is being \u201cwidely used\u201d to treat COVID-19 patients throughout the system, but the treatment protocols vary from patient to patient \u201cas the clinician decides.\u201d Currently about 700 patients are being treated across the hospital network, but Molient was not sure exactly how many were getting vitamin C treatments.\n\nThe vitamin C treatments are being administered in addition to other medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and various other biologicals and blood thinners, according to Weber. New York hospitals have been given federal permission to administer a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis.\n\nVitamin C levels dramatically drop in those with COVID-19 when they experience sepsis, which is an inflammatory response that happens when the body overreacts to the infection. \u201cIt makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,\u201d says Weber.\n\nZhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China is conducting clinical trials on the effectiveness of high dose intravenous vitamin C on COVID-19 patients. One is a randomized triple blind study involving 140 COVID-19 patients, and it is expected to be complete by September, 30, 2020 based on information posted in the National Library of Medicine\u2019s website.\n\nThe small French study published last week using the cocktail combination of hydroxychloroquine\/Plaquenil and azithromycin\/Zithromax showed that 5 out of 6 COVID-19 patients that were treated with the cocktail tested negative on day 3 and all tested negative on day 6. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases cautions that this cocktail has not been proven in clinical trials.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":159,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/3\/26\/21195917\/mark-blum-dies-actor-coronavirus-complications-desperately-seeking-susan-broadway","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-03-26","author":[],"title":"Actor Mark Blum dies of coronavirus complications; starred in \u2018Desperately Seeking Susan,\u2019 \u2018You\u2019","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/y_jPMP3RxW-YB5xqeGPAnVKujo0=\/0x303:2000x1350\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19839983\/GettyImages_104390549.jpg","body_text":"Veteran stage and screen actor Mark Blum has died from complications of coronavirus.\n\nBlum, known for his work in movies like \u201cDesperately Seeking Susan\u201d and \u201cCrocodile Dundee,\u201d as well as a host of Broadway and off-Broadway theater productions and television works, was 69.

Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, chairs of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform, said Tuesday that the pandemic has forced them to miss a deadline in their efforts.\n\nThe commission was required to release a report by Tuesday with recommendations on how to end entrenched corruption in Illinois, but as the COVID-19 crisis has temporarily shut down sessions of the General Assembly, it has also stymied the work of the commission.\n\n\u201cWe have completed our meetings, heard from stakeholders and are working through the proposals that have been put before us,\u201d the two Chicago Democrats said in a joint statement. \u201cHowever, due to the ongoing crisis, more time will be necessary to complete our work.\u201d\n\nThe commission, established by the Legislature in November, is tasked with proposing ways to reform state government in the wake of scandals that have rocked state, county and municipal government.

Before the pandemic, a growing number of governments banned single-use plastic bags in an effort to cut down on waste. But as the novel coronavirus has spread around the globe, people have gotten leery about coming in close contact with other people and their possessions, including reusable bags. On March 31st, New Hampshire became the first state in the US to temporarily ban reusable bags during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, people seem to get very fired up about grocery bags,\u201d says Meghan May, a professor of microbiology and infectious disease at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. \u201cOrdinarily I use [reusable bags] all the time because I live in a beach town and a clean ocean is really important,\u201d May tells The Verge. But now she and many others are thinking twice.\n\nThere has been no evidence of reusable bags spreading the novel coronavirus\n\nLike pretty much everything else right now, reusable bags should probably be handled more carefully to minimize the risk of transmitting disease to other people. At the same time, there has been no evidence so far that using reusable grocery bags have been responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus.\n\nWe don\u2019t really know how long the novel coronavirus can persist on reusable bags. The best data experts have is from one study that found that the virus could stay viable on plastic for up to three days in lab conditions. (That means shoppers may want to be careful when handling disposable plastic bags, too, environmental advocates contend.) That research didn\u2019t look into how the virus fares on fabric, so we can\u2019t apply its findings directly to cloth bags, according to May.\n\nShoppers should still take precautions with reusable bags, despite the lack of data, May advises. \u201cOne would want to err on the side of caution here because we know [the virus] can survive on many different types of surfaces,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should probably assume that it can be transmitted that way until someone demonstrates that it can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cErr on the side of caution.\u201d\n\nOne way to stop the spread of germs is to wash reusable bags before and after each use. (That\u2019s in addition to washing your hands before and after you go to the store, avoiding touching your face, wiping down baskets and carts, and bagging your own items.) Plastic and nylon bags can be cleaned with soap and water, then sprayed or wiped down with a diluted bleach solution or disinfectant, according to recommendations from North Carolina State University. Make sure to clean both the inside and outside of the bag and let them air dry before storing or using them, the university adds, and cloth bags can be washed like laundry, then they should be dried on the warmest setting.\n\nBut the virus could transfer quickly from one person to an item they\u2019ve been in close contact with, like a bag, reusable or otherwise, May points out. If an infected person hands the bag to someone else, they risk passing along the virus. The person who faces the most risk, according to May, is the grocery store worker interacting with many customers throughout his or her shift. \u201cThey have to touch [the reusable bag], handle it and pack things into it, and then they have to then turn around and do that with the next customer that comes in their line,\u201d May says. \u201cThe person at least risk is the person who owns the bag.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why some grocery stores and states are turning back to disposable bags: they simply aren\u2019t handled quite as much, so there\u2019s less uncertainty over where they\u2019ve been.\n\nBut protecting public health doesn\u2019t have to be at odds with efforts to stem the flood of plastics filling landfills and collecting in the ocean, environmental advocates say. \u201cIf stores, particularly workers, want to keep themselves as safe as possible and limit the bags coming in because they don\u2019t know if people wash them, certainly a temporary pause on that, I think that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Ivy Schlegel, a senior research specialist for Greenpeace USA, says. But that \u201cpause\u201d shouldn\u2019t be permanent, says Schlegel. She has followed the plastics industry\u2019s history of fighting environmental reforms by claiming that reusable bags are unsanitary. She sees the industry seizing the opportunity now to push its own agenda.\n\nA frequently cited 2011 study that found bacteria in seldom-washed reusable bags was actually underwritten by a fossil fuel and chemical industry group, the American Chemistry Council. It was cited in a March 18th letter that the Plastics Industry Association penned to the Department of Health and Human Services asking that the department \u201cspeak out against bans on [single-use plastic] products as a public safety risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people will call it disaster capitalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people will call it disaster capitalism,\u201d says Schlegel. \u201cUsing this moment where everything is in chaos and people are legitimately concerned about public health to turn back the clock to go back to a world where plastic is the norm, rather than right now where reusables are becoming the norm in many places.\u201d\n\nThe plastic pollution problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. A plastic grocery bag adrift in the ocean can take up to 20 years to decompose. A plastic bottle could stick around for up to 450 years, according to estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Less than 10 percent of all plastics have actually been recycled. The industry knew all along that recycling wouldn\u2019t solve the environmental harms posed by plastic, but it continued to promote it as a viable solution anyway, according to a joint investigation by PBS Frontline and NPR published this week.\n\nThere are ways to limit plastic waste during the COVID-19 pandemic. May recommends simply carrying groceries straight from the basket or cart to your car if that\u2019s possible. Paper bags are another alternative; they are still single-use, but at least they\u2019re compostable. And Schlegel tells The Verge that one way to make reusable bags cleaner and more convenient in the future could be to implement municipal programs that pick up residents\u2019 reusable bags, sanitize them, and then return them to stores for reuse. Those solutions might not be available everywhere during this pandemic, but they\u2019re worth thinking about as we prepare for what comes next. In the long run, protecting public health and the planet usually go hand in hand.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":247,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/6\/21209809\/blue-origin-new-shepard-employees-covid-19-coronavirus-positive-test","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-06","author":"['Loren Grush']","title":"Three employees at Blue Origin test positive for COVID-19 after workers voice concern over test launch","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/LzqkyuGjMUCY0IpQjisiqA8Czgs=\/0x144:2000x1191\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/6172587\/Blue_Origin_New_Shepard_launch.0.jpg","body_text":"Three Blue Origin employees have now tested positive for COVID-19 in Washington, according to emails from the company seen by The Verge.

The two new confirmed cases are a married couple who work at Blue Origin\u2019s headquarters in Kent, Washington. One was last in the office as early as Friday, April 3rd, while the other had last been in the office on March 27th, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, we unfortunately had two more Blue Origin employees test positive.\u201d\n\nBlue Origin says its human resources team will keep in contact with the employees, and the company has conducted a \u201cthorough deep cleaning\u201d of the places visited by the individuals. The company stressed to employees that they should stay home if they are sick. An email sent out on Friday told employees: \u201cAs a reminder, public health officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consider being in the same indoor environment, such as a conference room or factory, as a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 as being a low risk for infection.\u201d\n\nThe news of the cases comes after The Verge revealed that employees at Blue Origin have raised concerns about conducting a test launch of the company\u2019s New Shepard rocket, designed to take paying customers to the edge of space and back.

In a meeting with employees, Blue Origin management suggested that there might be employment repercussions if people didn\u2019t travel for the launch. In response to The Verge\u2019s report, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith told employees in an email that the company would, in fact, be hiring amid the pandemic and not conducting layoffs.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":250,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/6\/21211217\/pets-cats-tigers-bronx-zoo-covid-19-coronavirus","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-06","author":"['Justine Calma']","title":"Tigers (and other cats) can catch the coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/98EpAWCmblB3tYLQO_0zazCrAYs=\/0x394:5244x3140\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19876997\/674396606.jpg.jpg","body_text":"When I heard that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for COVID-19, I started to worry about my own little lion, a tabby cat with asthma. I\u2019ve sequestered myself away from friends and family, but could my company be unwittingly putting my cat at risk? While there have been some cases of animals contracting COVID-19, it\u2019s rare \u2014 and there are precautions that pet owners can take if they\u2019re worried about their furry family members.\n\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, which means that they can be passed between animals and humans. In New York City, the virus apparently jumped from an asymptomatic human to three lions and four tigers, including four-year-old tiger Nadia, that tested positive for the virus. The zoo says it expects all of the animals to make full recoveries.\n\nScientists still don\u2019t know for sure what type of animal first passed the new virus to a person. A wet market, where animals, seafood, and produce are sold, in China was thought to be where the novel coronavirus first made the jump. But a January study found the first person known to get sick from the virus didn\u2019t have contact with the market. Another study found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus infecting people was a 99 percent genetic match with one found in pangolins, one of the most trafficked mammals in Asia, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The pangolins might have been an intermediary carrying the virus from bats to humans. Another analysis found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus is 96 percent identical to a coronavirus found in bats, which have been identified as the origin of both SARS and MERS.\n\nThere has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person.\n\nEven though the virus kicked off a pandemic by being passed from one species to another, it\u2019s not often that coronaviruses make this kind of interspecies jump and continue spreading, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreaks happening now are the result of people passing the virus to one another. Despite that, some animal advocacy groups are worried that misguided fear of COVID-19 patients\u2019 pets could lead to more animals abandoned and mistreated.\n\nThere have been a few cases of domestic cats and dogs testing positive for the virus after their owners became sick with COVID-19. A 17-year-old Pomeranian in Hong Kong tested \u201cweakly positive\u201d in February and died in March, but the dog might have simply died of old age, according to reporting from the South China Morning Post. A two-year-old German shepherd in Hong Kong tested positive after its owner came down with the disease, while another dog that lived in the same home didn\u2019t. A cat in Hong Kong and another cat in Belgium have also tested positive. The cat in Belgium \u201cshowed clinical signs of digestive and respiratory disease,\u201d according to information from the National Veterinary Services of Belgium.\n\nCats might be more susceptible to COVID-19 than dogs, according to one study conducted in China that hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed. Domestic cats that had been infected with the virus by introducing samples of it through their noses were placed in kennels next to cats that were not infected. The researchers later found that one of the previously healthy cats caught the virus after being near the infected felines, most likely through respiratory droplets \u2014 the same way humans can spread the virus through coughing and sneezing. Dogs in the study, on the other hand, seemed to be more resistant to the virus and did not pass it to one another. There was no evidence that the cats shed enough of the virus to give it to people.\n\nThose results should be taken with a grain of salt since it was a small study of animals given high doses of the virus. They don\u2019t \u201crepresent real-life interactions between people and their pets,\u201d virologist Linda Saif at Ohio State University in Wooster told Nature.\n\nIf you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, and sharing food.\n\nIf you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, sharing food, and having other close contact with your pet to avoid passing the disease on to them. Ask someone else in your household to take care of your pet if that\u2019s possible, and wash your hands before and after touching your pet if it\u2019s a service animal or if you do have to care for it while you\u2019re sick. The same guidelines apply if you think you might be sick but haven\u2019t been tested or are waiting for results. Wearing a mask around your pet is also appropriate if you\u2019re ill, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nBecause the novel coronavirus can survive for some time on different surfaces, there is a slight chance that our furry friends could carry the virus even though they\u2019re not infected. But the only study to date of how long the virus can persist on surfaces looked at plastic, metal, and cardboard \u2014 not animal fur. It\u2019s usually harder for a virus to survive and spread to another person via a porous surface, like hair or fur, because it\u2019s more likely to get trapped in the pores of the material, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The CDC points out that any animal can carry germs that might make a person sick, so whether there\u2019s a pandemic or not, it\u2019s a good idea to wash your hands after handling any animal, its food, or waste.\n\nThe bottom line is that we\u2019ll probably need to take similar precautions with our pets as we do with our human loved ones. That means keeping a safe distance when necessary so that we can all stay healthy.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":255,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/04\/07\/829318450\/questions-about-hydroxychloroquine-touted-as-a-covid-19-treatment","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-04-07","author":"['Joe Palca']","title":"Questions About Hydroxychloroquine, Touted As A COVID-19 Treatment","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/include\/images\/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"Questions About Hydroxychloroquine, Touted As A COVID-19 Treatment Dr. Jinoos Yazdany, a rheumatologist from the University of California, San Francisco, and NPR science correspondent Joe Palca answer questions about the drug hydroxychloroquine.\n\nQuestions About Hydroxychloroquine, Touted As A COVID-19 Treatment 8:04 Questions About Hydroxychloroquine, Touted As A COVID-19 Treatment 8:04 Medical Treatments Questions About Hydroxychloroquine, Touted As A COVID-19 Treatment Questions About Hydroxychloroquine, Touted As A COVID-19 Treatment 8:04 Dr. Jinoos Yazdany, a rheumatologist from the University of California, San Francisco, and NPR science correspondent Joe Palca answer questions about the drug hydroxychloroquine.

Everyone in Illinois can help make it happen. But Gov. J.B. Pritzker needs to make a call first.\n\nRaskar, a former Google and Facebook technologist who holds nearly 100 patents, heads a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that has developed a digital contact tracing app called PrivateKit: SafePaths. It\u2019s available free from the iPhone and Android app stores.\n\nContact tracing is essential to stopping COVID-19. It\u2019s one of what Pritzker calls the \u201cthree T\u2019s\u201d \u2014 testing, tracing and treatment. The head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we need to do it.\n\nTraditional contact tracing is slow and tedious. When someone tests positive for a dangerous virus, you find out everyone they\u2019ve been in contact with for as long as they\u2019ve been contagious \u2014 in COVID-19\u2019s case, at least 14 days.\n\nThen, you track down those people, test them, quarantine the infected ones and trace their contacts. Once everyone with the disease has been identified and isolated, the pandemic stops.\n\nTraditional contact tracing is practical only in the early days of an outbreak, when few people have been infected. In most of the United States, we\u2019re long past that point.\n\nIf everyone cooperates with the stay-at-home order, though, and the COVID-19 caseload drops, eventually contact tracing becomes doable again.\n\nJust one problem. Researchers at Oxford University have found that because COVID-19 is transmitted so easily \u2014 many with the disease are contagious for a week before they show symptoms, and some never get symptoms at all \u2014 contact tracing has to be almost instantaneous to do any good. If it takes days, that\u2019s too late.\n\nDigital technology using smartphones makes instant contact tracing possible. As I previously wrote, China and South Korea successfully used it to control the pandemic.\n\nBut the technology can be intrusive. In China, people must have software installed on their phones that tracks their every move \u2014 useful when you\u2019re trying to stamp out a pandemic but also handy for controlling the masses.\n\nSouth Korea isn\u2019t that bad, but the emergency alerts it beams out when someone tests positive for the coronavirus sometimes go into creepy detail about the patient\u2019s travels \u2014 reportedly including an overnight excursion to a \u201clove motel.\u201d\n\nThe PrivateKit app that Raskar and his team have developed sidesteps such problems. It uses Bluetooth technology to record any close encounters you have with other PrivateKit users plus GPS location data to create a diary of your daily travels.\n\nThe diary is encrypted and lives only on your phone. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can \u2014 if you choose \u2014 turn your diary over to public health officials. They use software to scrub any details that identify you personally and load the result into a database.\n\nThen they click on a button. An alert is sent instantly to every PrivateKit user with whom you came into contact in the past 14 days, telling them they could be at risk and providing instructions.\n\nThat\u2019s it. No details about you.\n\nNow suppose that before you tested positive you inadvertently came into contact with Jack, who hadn\u2019t downloaded the PrivateKit app. The encounter wasn\u2019t recorded in your diary, but your path was.\n\nThe day after you test positive, Jack downloads the app and has it check for COVID-19 contacts. The app searches the database, finds out Jack crossed paths with you and pops up an alert.\n\nBut wait, what if Jack never downloads the app or doesn\u2019t even have a phone? If he comes down with COVID-19, how will health authorities know he got it from me?\n\nThey\u2019ll figure it out the old-fashioned way with digital assistance. They\u2019ll painstakingly ask Jack to recall his travels and load the information into the database. The software will do a search and, you\u2019d hope, establish that Jack crossed paths with you.\n\nIt might not always work. But if mostly it does, and most COVID-19 carriers can be identified and isolated, the pandemic will peter out.\n\nYou\u2019re thinking: This sounds like a long shot. Why bother?\n\nTwo reasons. One is to protect yourself. The other is to protect your family and friends.\n\nAt some point, stay-at-home restrictions will have to be eased, and people will start going back to work or school. Large gatherings will likely continue to be prohibited, but some semblance of normal activity must resume for the economy to start up again. And people will want to hang out, play sports, attend weddings, visit their elderly parents and generally get back to having a life.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you want to protect those people? If you go to a party and later test positive for COVID-19, wouldn\u2019t you want the attendees to know? If someone else at the party gets the disease, wouldn\u2019t you want to be told?\n\nThat\u2019s what PrivateKit does. If I go to any social gatherings or work meetings, I\u2019ll want the app on my phone, and I\u2019m not walking in unless everybody else has it, too.\n\nLots of people need to use the app to get the pandemic under control. Christophe Fraser, a co-author of the Oxford study, told me the adoption rate has be roughly 60%. Fat chance we\u2019ll get the whole country to that level. It\u2019ll be tough enough in Illinois.\n\nSo what? The app will help even if adoption is a lot less.\n\n\u201cEvery life we save matters,\u201d Raskar says. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to eliminate one case and prevent one elderly person from being exposed.\u201d\n\nNone of this is possible without the support of local authorities. They need the software to enter the diaries of COVID-19 patients into the database, and medical personnel have to be trained in how to use it. An administrative infrastructure has to be set up to make the whole thing work.\n\nA huge team isn\u2019t needed. Raskar estimates it would take 300 people statewide, plus additional staff to do traditional contact tracing as a backup. He\u2019s working with 20 jurisdictions around the country. He says Illinois could \u2014 and should \u2014 be the first to start.\n\nPritzker understands the importance of contact tracing. When I asked him at his briefing Thursday whether he was considering a contact tracing program, he responded enthusiastically.\n\nGovernor, please call Raskar and have him explain the technology and how it would be implemented. He\u2019s got the best plan I\u2019ve heard of for getting us past this nightmare.\n\nDigital contact tracing worked in Asia. We can \u2014 and need \u2014 to do it here.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":293,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/10\/21216593\/remote-learning-chicago-public-schools-coronavirus-consortium-on-chicago-school-research-op-ed","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-10","author":[],"title":"Remote learning has pitfalls, but we can still help students be successful in this challenging time","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/VNC6SVZ5mhTtDXDIRlpvgnSDuWU=\/0x66:920x548\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19891867\/computer_keyboard_2.0.jpg","body_text":"Next week, more than 355,000 Chicago Public Schools students will begin remote learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced teachers, students and families to make quick adjustments into new daily roles and routines.\n\nSome families may be undergoing such profound stress that students cannot do any schoolwork at all. For other students, schoolwork may provide some stability and a sense of purpose for their future.\n\nThe good news is that even when faced with major disruptions in learning, children are resilient and tend to catch up in skill development to where they would have been, as long as they enter a supportive environment after the disruption. Students who have a smaller gain in learning in one year tend to have a larger gain in the following year.\n\nOpinion\n\nAs the district, teachers, and families figure out the strategies that work best for them, there are lessons from research conducted under normal conditions that may be helpful in this unique situation.\n\nCountering the limitations of online Instruction\n\nResearch indicates that most students learn better when instruction is in person, rather than online, and students with the lowest achievement seem to benefit least from online classes. Even if online instruction isn\u2019t as effective as face-to-face instruction, it is still effective for most students, and better than no instruction.\n\nOne reason students sometimes struggle with online learning is because of a lack of flexibility in what is taught. While online classes are usually self-paced, course content can feel rigid. In a study comparing online to face-to-face algebra credit recovery classes, researchers found that face-to-face teachers adjusted the content of their instruction considerably more than online teachers, even though the online teachers had the technology to be able to offer mini-tutorials and respond directly to students\u2019 questions.\n\nIt was easier for the in-person teachers to recognize when students needed help and adapt their instruction accordingly. In fact, when students taking the algebra course online had access to a supportive math teacher in their computer lab, they ended up with similar pass rates as students enrolled in face-to-face versions of the same class.\n\nAll of this suggests that online learning places more demands on teachers around intentional communication with students and their caregivers.\n\nCommunication among teachers, students, and families is even more critical now\n\nAnother downside of online instruction is that it makes two-way communication more cumbersome. Teachers can\u2019t anticipate how all their individual students will respond to instructional tasks, and the feedback they ordinarily get in the classroom as they watch and listen to students engage with the material is vital information for doing their jobs well.\n\nStudents feel supported when they believe their teacher knows how they are doing in the class and gives them the support they need to succeed. Without having students in front of them, teachers may not know when they are assigning work that is taking longer than it should to complete and when students feel stuck or overwhelmed. They also will have difficulty recognizing when students are under-challenged or disinterested.\n\nIt can be easier for people at home to see whether students need more support, whether work is taking too long, or if students feel under-challenged. To support learning at home, teachers and families need to be in regular communication, whether they have the technology for face-to-face online chats, or are reaching out by phone, group chats, texting, etc.\n\nEven when assignments are not being used for grades, teachers can monitor assignment completion as a signal for who might need help, modifications, resources, or a more personal connection.\n\nLearning is more than test scores \u2014 it\u2019s also social and emotional\n\nBrain science has shown that learning has both social and emotional components\u2014people are not computers who can input information and retain it without making an emotional connection and seeing how it fits with their other experiences.\n\nTeachers and caregivers who are supporting learning at home need to talk to students about how they are experiencing the work. Do students believe they can succeed at the task? Do they feel the work is relevant? Do they feel they will learn and grow from the experience?\n\nStudents\u2019 confidence that they can succeed at their school assignments, and that the work has value, provides a sense of security and motivation.\n\nWhat happens in the long-term will matter most\n\nThere is no clear roadmap for teachers, parents, and guardians right now. Nobody is going to be perfect in how they are able to support students, even as they all work very hard to do so. The crisis is causing acute immediate stress \u2014 from sharing confined space and home technology, to worry about severe financial and health effects on ourselves and others.\n\nThere will also be long-term stress from the financial fallout of the crisis and the loss of loved ones. Families will not have all the financial and emotional supports that they did previously, and inequities in education will become more extreme.\n\nSupporting all students ultimately means making preparation so that students have a safe, stable school environment that is responsive to the social-emotional needs of every child when they go back to the classroom.\n\nElaine Allensworth, PhD, is director of the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":294,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/wolves\/2020\/4\/11\/21217068\/jaycob-megna-family-experiences-childbirth-during-covid-19-chicago-wolves-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-11","author":"['Brian Sandalow']","title":"Megna family experiences childbirth during COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/wfjXrQY9GyV3KSEA6V1tWZXrGvE=\/0x392:5472x3257\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19892586\/48849950951_3fc2032a80_o.jpg","body_text":"Wolves defenseman Jaycob Megna and his wife, Kasey, recently had their first child, welcoming a new member to their family. It\u2019s a stressful occasion even in the best circumstances, but Evie Marie arrived March 30 in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2018Once the baby is born, you\u2019ve got another person that you\u2019re in charge of that you need to protect,\u2019\u2019 Megna said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s obviously not an ideal time with everything going on, but the one benefit is that I\u2019ve been able to be around for everything. It\u2019s been just over a week, and it\u2019s been amazing.\u2019\u2019\n\nEvie\u2019s birth originally was scheduled for the Chicago area, but the suspension of the American Hockey League season and the league allowing players to leave their home markets afforded the Megnas an opportunity to switch plans. They chose to bring Evie into the world at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania, near Kasey\u2019s parents\u2019 home.\n\nThe Megnas needed one day to reach Kasey\u2019s parents\u2019 home \u2014 where they\u2019re currently staying \u2014 to prepare for the birth.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was definitely stressful,\u2019\u2019 Megna said. \u2018\u2018Just getting here was a little stressful, just making sure nothing happened while we were driving, considering she was only two weeks from her due date when we were getting here. More so for my wife, it being our first kid, going through the whole process and being at a hospital, it is a bit overwhelming.\u2019\u2019\n\nOnce the Megnas got to the hospital for Evie\u2019s birth, they weren\u2019t there long. They were told Kasey normally would be in the hospital for three nights, but she and Evie spent only 36 hours there before going home. Once doctors saw they were healthy, they were allowed to depart early.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was definitely a bit of a different experience, I would assume, than most,\u2019\u2019 Megna said. \u2018\u2018It was still amazing.\u2019\u2019\n\nOther than medical staff, only one person was allowed to be in the delivery room. Masks were mandatory when visitors entered, and Megna couldn\u2019t leave even for food or water.\n\n\u2018\u2018Everything you needed, you had to call and they would bring it to you,\u2019\u2019 Megna said. \u2018\u2018Three days of that might\u2019ve been a little much. We were lucky we were able to get out of there quickly and safely.\u2019\u2019\n\nThough the circumstances might have been unorthodox, Megna said he has no complaints about the experience.\n\nKasey and Evie are doing well, and Megna expects his parents soon will be able to meet their new granddaughter. He praised the medical staff that cared for his family, and the AHL hiatus has allowed him to spend more time with his infant daughter and recovering wife.\n\nIf the season hadn\u2019t been halted, Megna would have been able to be at Evie\u2019s birth, but he would have missed out on many other moments he has witnessed.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s been pretty special,\u2019\u2019 Megna said. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a lot going on, but we\u2019re staying home like we\u2019re supposed to, and it\u2019s been a big opportunity to get to see my daughter quite a bit.

It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.\n\nFrench medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the \u201cgerm theory\u201d of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine B\u00e9champ promoted a theory of \u201cterrain,\u201d or sometimes referred to as the \u201ccellular theory.\u201d\n\nThe following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:\n\nAn objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.\n\nFor example, Pasteur\u2019s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.\n\nBut as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur\u2019s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by B\u00e9champ that the \u201cterrian,\u201d more commonly referred to today as the body\u2019s \u201cimmune system,\u201d is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.\n\nThe evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded \u201cplagues\u201d or \u201cpandemics\u201d in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.\n\nOf course today\u2019s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body\u2019s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today\u2019s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don\u2019t provide the same profit. See:\n\nBut just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer\u2019s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a \u201chygiene\u201d protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow B\u00e9champ\u2019s theories by bolstering the body\u2019s immune system with great success in treating disease.\n\nOne such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.\n\nDr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.\n\nSo what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?\n\n85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths\n\nby Dr. Brownstein\n\nAt my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.\n\nThere are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.\n\nAs of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)\n\nI first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.\n\nIn that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.\n\nFinally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.\n\nThat post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.\n\nThe human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.\n\nThe initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.\n\nThankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted\u2014though many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.\n\nAt my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.\n\nIn my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.\n\nHowever, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.\n\nTo protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.\n\nTo watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (3\/28\/20): Christopher\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (3\/30\/20): Jeremiah\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (4\/05\/20): Kendra\n\nI think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.\n\nFolks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine\u2019s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.\n\nIn the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.\n\nA holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.\n\nThere is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.\n\nAs I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about\u2014they kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.\n\nHaving them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.\n\nThis therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLike most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.\n\nBetter times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.\n\nTo All Our Health,\n\n~DrB\n\nSource.","news_guard_score":25,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":298,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/11\/world\/coronavirus-news.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-11","author":[],"title":"India to Extend Lockdown Against Coronavirus, While Spain Eases Work Rules","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/04\/11\/world\/11hpvirus-promo\/11hpvirus-promo-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg","body_text":"This briefing has ended. Read global live updates on the coronavirus here.\n\nCountries around the world are weighing the costs and benefits of reopening society.The coronavirus pandemic continued its global assault on Saturday, with more than 1.7 million known cases recorded worldwide and at least 107,000 deaths.\nBut even as some countries join the list of those with broad lockdown orders and others maintain or extend sweeping shutdowns, others have begun eyeing the benefits of reopening at least some parts of society.\nIn Iran, the hardest-hit country so far in its region, some government offices and shops, factories and other businesses began reopening on Saturday as the national lockdown is lifted in phases. President Hassan Rouhani had said last week that economic and government activity must continue. On Saturday, he said that people should still observe social distancing.\nThe lifting of restrictions came despite warnings from the country\u2019s health ministry that the reopening could cause a new spike in cases and tens of thousands of additional deaths.\nSome of the most grievously hit countries in Europe, while still recording hundreds of new deaths every day, say that the worst appears to be past. Their plans to ease some restrictions, they caution, will not bring normalcy, but instead a new phase of learning how to safely live with the pandemic.\n[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Spain, with the world\u2019s highest caseload after the United States, is preparing to allow some nonessential employees to return to work on Monday. The country has reported a falling death rate and a daily growth in new cases of about 3 percent, compared with 20 percent in mid-March.\nBut officials stressed the limits of that easing. \u201cSpain continues in a state of lockdown,\u201d Health Minister Salvador Illa warned  on Friday. \u201cWe are not yet in a de-escalation phase.\u201d\nItaly, which follows Spain in cases but has the highest death toll after the United States, will allow some bookstores, children\u2019s clothing shops and some forestry-related occupations to resume operations after the current restrictions expire on Tuesday.\nAustria plans to reopen smaller shops after this weekend. The Czech Republic is opening small stores, and people can play tennis and go swimming.  Denmark may reopen kindergartens and schools starting next week, Norway will allow pupils to attend kindergarten.\nAnd China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged.For many countries, the question of whether to ease restrictions does not have a clear answer yet. In the United States, President Trump \u2014 and governors of each state \u2014 are balancing calls from medical experts to keep restrictions in place with pleas from bankers, corporate executives and industrialists to ease them.\nIndia, on the other hand, appears set to extend a 21-day lockdown for all 1.3 billion citizens for two more weeks, carrying it to the end of April. During a meeting with top officials, Mr. Modi said the lockdown had helped blunt the outbreak but that \u201cconstant vigilance is paramount,\u201d according to a statement from his office.\nSome countries put in place new measures. Turkey on Friday ordered a two-day curfew for 31 provinces. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has ordered air traffic to the country halted after more than 70 people who arrived from Newark, N.J., on Saturday morning left Ben Gurion Airport without official verifications of their mandatory quarantine plans and checks of their temperatures.\nA Times examination reveals the extent of President Trump\u2019s slow response to the virus, which has now claimed more than 20,000 lives in the U.S.\nThroughout January, as President Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues, an array of figures inside his government \u2014 from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies \u2014 identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action.\nDozens of interviews and a review of emails and other records by The New York Times revealed many previously unreported details of the roots and extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s halting response.  Read the full investigation.\nThe country now has more than 515,000 confirmed cases, by far the world\u2019s largest count, and more than 20,000 deaths, surpassing Italy\u2019s as the world\u2019s heaviest toll.  More than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs.\nHere\u2019s what else is happening in the United States:On Saturday,  the U.S. surpassed Italy in the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus with 20,109. Government projections obtained by The New York Times  found that without any mitigation, the death toll from the virus could have reached 300,000 \u2014 and that it could reach 200,000 if the Trump administration lifts 30-day stay-at-home orders.  Read the latest updates for the United States. Christians across the United States prepared to celebrate Easter by gathering virtually on Sunday, largely following stay-at-home orders and guidance from health officials. A handful of lone pastors in states like Louisiana and Mississippi plan to hold in-person services in defiance of restrictions on mass gatherings, citing their religious freedoms. President Trump said in a tweet that he will watch the online service of First Baptist Dallas, led by Robert Jeffress, one of his prominent supporters.The largest states are split on when and how to reopen. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have started talking about reopening businesses and schools, echoing signals from Mr. Trump. But the leaders of California and New York, both Democrats, are sounding more cautious notes. Top officials in New York,  the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 180,000 cases, appear to disagree over whether New York City schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.  Read the latest updates for the New York region.Citing the virus, the Trump administration announced that it would issue visa penalties on countries that refuse to accept people the U.S. aims to deport. With so many restaurants and schools closed and other sources of demand disrupted, many of the largest farms in the country are  being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they haven\u2019t been able to sell or donate to food banks, which can only absorb so much perishable food.\nAs coronavirus cases rise in Latin America, murder rates fall.\nAs countries contend with escalating body counts from the pandemic, some are experiencing an unanticipated decline in a different form of death: murder.\nLockdowns have reduced opportunities for homicides and other crimes, and the virus has taken some criminals out of action as they hunker down in their homes. Some gangs have even led efforts to impose curfews in neighborhoods where they hold sway.\nThe drop in murders is especially notable in Latin America, the region with the highest homicide rates in the world outside of war.\nIn El Salvador, for example, there were just 65 homicides in March, down from 114 in February. Neighboring Honduras has also seen a falloff in killings in recent weeks, as has Colombia and the most populous state in Mexico.\nThe pandemic is \u201ctaking people off the streets,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. \u201cThe rule of thumb is: the stricter the lockdown, the bigger the effect on crimes committed against strangers on the street.\u201d\nHere are other developments in the pandemic around the world:Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak is one of the world\u2019s deadliest, counting more than 152,000 cases and more than 19,450 deaths. Health care workers have been hard-hit, and so has another force on the front lines: The virus has killed nearly 100 priests.France, which has the world\u2019s fifth largest known outbreak, reported on Saturday that the total number of patients in intensive care fell for the third day in a row, to roughly 6,880. With nearly 94,000 cases, the country has logged more than 13,800 deaths.Tokyo reported a record number of new cases on Saturday, at 197. The city has confirmed a total of 40 deaths from the virus. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan had not yet hit its target of reducing commuting by at least 70 percent, and asked all businesses to let employees work from home.Chile will start handing out certificates to people who have recovered that will exempt them from quarantines and other restrictions.The World Health Organization said that it was looking into reports of some recovering Covid-19 patients testing positive again after testing negative, a day after South Korean officials said that 91 previously cleared patients had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus might have been \u201creactivated\u201d rather than the patients being reinfected.\nChina delays exports of ventilators and other crucial medical supplies for quality checks.\nThe Chinese government has ordered that no more N95 respirators, ventilators, hospital gowns and other key medical supplies be exported until customs officials perform quality inspections on each shipment.\nThe new policy, announced by China\u2019s General Administration of Customs on Friday, produced immediate delays to cargos on Saturday as manufacturers, freight agents and traders tried to understand how to comply. China is the world\u2019s dominant producer of a wide range of medical supplies, and its manufacturing lead has widened in many sectors as it has engaged in a nationwide mobilization of medical supplies production since late January.\nThe Chinese customs agency said that it had previously checked whether medical supplies were accurately counted, whether they infringed foreign patents and other intellectual property, and whether they had fraudulent documents. But now the agency will also assess the quality of goods.\nThe agency gave no indication of how long the quality testing might take.The policy comes after a series of complaints from Europe that medical supplies from China had problems. Chinese officials have countered that many of these supplies were industrial respirators that were not designed to meet medical standards and should not be expected to do so.\nThe new rules cover China\u2019s exports in 11 categories: medical respirators and surgical masks, medical protective clothing, infrared thermometers, ventilators, surgical caps, medical goggles, medical gloves, medical shoe covers, patient monitors, medical disinfection towels and medical disinfectants.\nMontreal police open a criminal investigation into deaths at a nursing home.\nThe police in Montreal said on Saturday night that they had launched a criminal investigation into a private residence for the elderly after 31 people had died there since March 13, at least five of them from confirmed cases of Covid-19.\nQuebec\u2019s premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, said that the government had learned of the deaths at the 150-bed R\u00e9sidence Herron, in a suburb west of Montreal, on Friday, and that he believed they amounted to \u201cgross negligence.\u201d\n\u201cThis is terrible what happened,\u201d Mr. Legault said on Saturday, adding that when officials from the regional health authority had arrived at the residence on March 29 to investigate, \u201calmost all the staff was gone.\u201d\nAt that point, he said, the authority dispatched a team of health workers to care for the residents, and it has now taken over the running of the residence.\nAn investigation by Montreal Gazette, a local newspaper, said that residents had been discovered unfed and wearing clothing covered with feces.\nMr. Legault said that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d how the elderly were being cared for in Quebec, and that staff shortages and insufficient salaries had been an ongoing issue at privately run residences. \u201cI am not proud to see what is happening,\u201d he said.\nR\u00e9sidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company called Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. The company was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. But it previously said it had been doing its best under challenging circumstances.\nQuebec has been hit hard by the coronavirus. As of Saturday, it had 12,292 confirmed cases and 289 deaths. More than 90 percent of those who have died were 70 or older.\nOfficials said Saturday that after one resident at the Herron had tested positive for the virus, regional health authorities had reached out to the residence to learn more about the status of its residents, but were rebuffed. The authorities then obtained a court order to gain access to medical files, and learned of the number of deaths on Friday.\nQuebec\u2019s minister of health, Danielle McCann, ordered checks of private residences for the elderly across the province.\nMore than 50 workers chose isolation at their power plant to keep Vienna\u2019s lights on.\nThe global pandemic has forced countless people into isolation. In Vienna, for the sake of the entire city, 53 people volunteered.\nThey raised their hands to ensure that whatever else happens, the power plants that provide electricity to Austria\u2019s capital and its 2 million people would keep running.\nThe 53 employees of the Wien Energie company have been holed up in four power plants since March 20, after volunteering to go into their own version of a lockdown until April 16. Depending on how things go, they could be asked to stay on longer.\nThe workers miss their families, but shrug off the idea that they are making a big sacrifice, pointing out that doctors, nurses and other health workers had it much tougher.\n\u201cWe are just a cog in a much bigger wheel,\u201d said Steven Sacher, 24, an engineer at the Fl\u00f6tzersteig plant.\nWien Energie turned conference rooms into dormitories, and outfitted the plants with washing machines, fitness equipment, wireless internet \u2014 and, crucially, board games and jigsaw puzzles.\n\u201cWe have finished about 20 puzzles with 2,000 pieces,\u201d Mr. Wallner said. \u201cEveryone who has time stops and works on it a bit.\u201d\nMr. Sacher said his team has been piecing together a puzzle showing the Brooklyn Bridge at night, which gives way to an evening ritual.\n\u201cEvery night at 9 p.m. sharp, the four of us who aren\u2019t working get together and play Parcheesi,\u201d he said.\nPope Francis will say Easter Mass and deliver an annual message by live-stream.\nLast year, the Vatican\u2019s police force estimated that 70,000 faithful crammed into St. Peter\u2019s Square on Easter morning to hear the pope deliver his \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (\u201cTo the City and to the World\u201d) message after the Easter Mass.\nBut on Sunday, Pope Francis won\u2019t impart his Easter message and blessing from a window in the apostolic palace, from where he greets the faithful most Sundays. Instead, Francis will live-stream the Mass, followed by the message and a blessing, on the Vatican news website, starting at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. Eastern).\nPeople are prohibited from gathering in the square. And the Francis will celebrate Mass with just a few assistants inside the empty basilica.\nThe Vatican also live-streamed the Via Crucis, the traditional Good Friday procession that evokes the Stations of the Cross leading up to Christ\u2019s crucifixion, in St. Peter\u2019s Square instead of Rome\u2019s Colosseum, where it is traditionally held. At the end of the procession, Francis prayed silently before a wooden crucifix that had been carried during Rome\u2019s 16th-century plague.\nEarlier Friday, Francis called an Italian state TV Good Friday special to say he felt close to the victims of the pandemic, and that he was thinking about the \u201cdoctors, nurses, nuns and priests who had died on the front lines as soldiers, giving their life for love.\u201d\nIn this pandemic, many are resisting, in their communities, in hospitals, caring for the ill. \u201cEven today people are crucified, and die for love,\u201d Francis said.\nAt over 100 years old, they\u2019ve defied the odds and beat the virus.\nAs the coronavirus pandemic takes a disproportionate toll on older people around the world, several over the age of 100 have survived the brutal toll the disease takes on the body.\nCornelia Ras, 107, of the Netherlands is believed to be the oldest known survivor of the new coronavirus. She became ill last month after attending a church service on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the southwest part of the country.\nMs. Ras was given the all clear by her doctor on Monday.\u201cWe did not expect her to survive this,\u201d her niece Maaike de Groot told the Dutch newspaper AD. \u201cShe takes no medicines, still walks well and gets down on her knees every night to thank the Lord. From the looks of it, she will be able to continue to do so.\u201d\nKeith Watson, a 101-year-old man from western England, was in a hospital last month awaiting surgery when he developed a fever that prompted doctors to test him for the coronavirus, local health officials said.\nBut he pulled through, and on Thursday, he was discharged after recovering from the virus. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing for his age,\u201d his daughter-in-law Jo Watson told the BBC.\nOn March 9, Ada Zanusso, 103, was one of several residents of a nursing home in the town of Lessona, Italy, to become ill with the coronavirus. Twenty people had already died there, the newspaper La Repubblica reported.\n\u201cShe was ill for a week, even with critical moments,\u201d said Carla Furno Marchese, Mrs. Zanusso\u2019s family doctor since 1986, who also works with the nursing home.\nThen, \u201cmiraculously,\u201d Dr. Furno Marchese said in an interview, Ms. Zanusso improved. \u201cShe reacquired some strength, started eating again and then she got out of bed,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cNow she\u2019s perfectly normal, like before. She\u2019s doing great. She remembers everything.\u201d\nHer recovery has been embraced by many Italians still reeling from the toll the virus has taken on the country, which is enduring a lockdown. Ms. Zanusso had lived alone at home until four years ago, when she broke her femur and her children decided she would be better off in a care home. She had always been in good health, and has a deep faith.\n \u201cShe accepts everything that happens to her,\u201d the doctor said.\nTech giants team up to track the virus, as South Korea tightens its leading program.\nIn one of the most far-ranging attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Apple and Google said they were building software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with it.\nThe technology giants, usually fierce rivals, said they aimed to release the tool within several months, building it into the operating systems of billions of iPhones and Android devices around the world.\nUsers would opt in and voluntarily report if they became infected, and the smartphones would log other devices they came near, enabling \u201ccontact tracing\u201d of the disease, a measure that has proved effective, alongside mass testing in places like South Korea.\n\u201cIt could be a useful tool, but it raises privacy issues,\u201d said Dr. Mike Reid, an assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, who is helping San Francisco officials with contact tracing. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the sole solution, but as part of a robust sophisticated response, it has a role to play.\u201d\nSouth Korea, which has used a government-issued tracking app to trace contacts and enforce quarantine, said on Saturday that it planned to strap tracking wristbands on those who violated self-quarantine orders.\nHealth officials worry that some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home for two weeks have slipped out, leaving their smartphones behind.\nYoon Tae-ho, a senior disease-control official, told reporters on Saturday that the bands would be deployed within two weeks.\nOfficials admitted that they lacked a legal power to enforce wristband-wearing, but could consider lighter quarantine-breaking penalties to those who agreed to wear them.\nSouth Korea has reported between 27 and 53 new cases per day this week compared with several hundred a day between late February and early March.\nA British minister draws backlash for urging no \u2018overuse\u2019 of protective gear.\nThe British health secretary, Matt Hancock, has sparked anger among workers in the country\u2019s National Health Service after he urged them not to waste personal protective equipment.\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned on Saturday that supplies of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., were dangerously low in London and part of northern England, and said that doctors were putting their lives at risk to treat patients with the coronavirus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people don\u2019t overuse P.P.E.,\u201d Mr. Hancock said in a BBC radio interview on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s a precious resource.\u201d\nAt a daily briefing on Friday, he said that masks and aprons did not have to be changed after treating each patient.\nBut the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s general secretary, Donna Kinnair, told BBC\u2019s \u201cBreakfast\u201d show: \u201cI take offense, actually, that we are saying that health care workers are abusing or overusing P.P.E. I think what we know is, we don\u2019t have enough supply.\u201d\nThe opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, also said on Twitter: \u201cIt is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. There are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe.\u201d\nMr. Hancock also said on Saturday that 19 health service workers had died so far in the outbreak. Britain reported a daily total of 917 deaths in hospitals on Saturday, after a high of 980 on Friday. The total death toll stood at 9,975 as of Saturday.\nHe said the outbreak had yet to peak, although there were signs of hospital admissions \u201cstarting to flatten.\u201d\nWith temperatures expected to reach up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend, government officials have warned the British public to continue to abide by lockdown restrictions.\nThe condition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has continued to improve, his office said in a statement on Friday, adding that he had \u201cbeen able to do short walks, between periods of rest.\u201d He left intensive care on Thursday after three nights but remains in a hospital.\nAfter giving a rare televised address to the nation on Sunday, Queen Elizabeth II again delivered a message to Britons. She encouraged people to continue practicing social distancing and said that \u201cEaster isn\u2019t canceled.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that coronavirus will not overcome us,\u201d she said. \u201cAs dark as death can be, particularly for those suffering with grief, light and life are greater.\u201d\nThe pandemic is bringing old internet dreams to life.\nIt\u2019s been decades since utopian thinkers dreamed that cyberspace would miraculously fix societal woes. Yet the pandemic has prompted some to realize that social media \u2014 where we normally just promote ourselves \u2014 can be mobilized for building a sense of community.\nIn the United States, artists are singing opera, reading poetry and doing standup comedy on You-Tube and Instagram. These days, our reporter writes in The New York Times Magazine, online performances feel \u201cas though they were really less about pure entertainment and more about serving a nation, a world even, that was suffering in isolation and fear.\u201d\nHealing practitioners have also made meditation sessions, yoga classes and other mental-health assistance available free online. And GoFundMe is a vehicle for distributing money to people hit hardest by the crisis, including sex workers and underinsured artists.\nReporting was contributed by Dan Bilefsky, Raphael Minder, Carlotta Gall, Abdi Latif Dahir, Keith Bradsher, Ceylan Yeginsu, David Halbfinger, Jason Horowitz, Elisabetta Povoledo, Yonette Joseph, Choe Sang-Hun, Kai Schultz, Motoko Rich, Jenna Wortham, Kirk Semple, Azam Ahmed, Ian Austen, Andrew Higgins, Elaine Yu, Jason M.

J.B. Pritzker effectively put the kibosh on any 4\/20 parties when he extended a statewide stay-at-home order until May that prohibits large gatherings.\n\nDispensary 33 has since announced that the third annual Waldo\u2019s Forever Fest, a huge, bud-friendly bash slated to take place Saturday outside the pot shop at Clark and Division, will now be held online using the Twitch app. The physical event has tentatively been rescheduled for Sept. 26.\n\n\u201cThis 4\/20 was going to be on a whole \u2018nother level. We were super excited to blow it out with the street festival. I think we were going to have twice the size of out footprint last year,\u201d Dispensary 33 spokeswoman Abigail Watkins said of the event, which drew thousands last year.\n\nConsumption allowed \u2014 at home\n\nWatkins said the socially distanced shindig, scheduled to start at 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, looks to \u201cshowcase different personalities and different people\u2019s talents in the cannabis community all throughout Chicago.\u201d The bill features a live-stream of local DJs and glass blowers, as well as stony Chicago sibling rockers White Mystery and drag performers Lucy Stoole and Shea Coulee, a finalist on \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019ll be fun and we\u2019ll still be able to connect people through cannabis and celebrate,\u201d said Watkins. \u201cAlso people are going to be able to smoke at home and actually celebrate 4\/20 with consumption, which there wasn\u2019t going to be consumption on-site at the fest\u201d \u2014 since public consumption remains illegal.\n\nWith much of the country ordered to stay home, similar virtual events offer pot users a way to observe the \u201chigh\u201d holiday from their living rooms. One celebration scheduled for Monday and dubbed Higher Together features a DJ set and smoke session with rapper and reefer enthusiast Wiz Khalifa and a performance by Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nAll proceeds from a donation drive will go to the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit that seeks to address the harms of cannabis prohibition and is circulating a petition to urge President Donald Trump and the Federal Bureau of Prisons \u201cto take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on our incarcerated communities.\u201d\n\n2nd pot event moves online\n\nMeanwhile, Monday\u2019s second annual Chicago Cannabis Health and Wellness Fair at Olive-Harvey College is also moving online.\n\nOrganized by the Chicago Cannabis Health Initiative, the event boasts pot-centric panels, demonstrations and presentations on a range of topics, including weed-infused cooking, cannabis rights and using the drug to deal with pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. Donte Townsend, founder of the Chicago chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, an advocacy group co-sponsoring the event, will give a virtual talk on CBD & hemp, a plant he\u2019s been cultivating at a huge growth facility in Putnam County.\n\nThough Townsend said it\u2019s \u201ca little heartbreaking\u201d that plans had to be changed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, he tried to look on the bright side.\n\n\u201cWith what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ve found ways to be able to still offer a free service to the public about health and the beneficial uses of cannabis in its multiple forms that people can access from home,\u201d he said.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":319,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/14\/21220810\/immigrant-children-test-positive-covid-19-coronavirus-chicago-shelters-heartland-alliance","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-14","author":"['Carlos Ballesteros']","title":"Nearly 40 immigrant children test positive at Chicago shelters","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/Nq1ywh_SQj7yYm94AWuN13x8GxA=\/0x306:4240x2526\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19898217\/IMMIGKIDS_070118_08.jpg","body_text":"More than half of the 69 immigrant children sheltered by the nonprofit Heartland Alliance in Chicago have tested positive for the coronavirus, the organization announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not going to share the details of any specific child in our care, there have been 37 confirmed positive diagnoses to date,\u201d Heartland Alliance spokeswoman Mailee Garcia said.\n\n\u201cWe are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption.\u201d\n\nGarcia said the prognosis for the children \u201cis very good,\u201d adding that the nonprofit \u201caggressively moved to obtain testing for all of the children in our care \u2014 even those who are asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nHeartland Alliance operates three dormitory-like shelters for unaccompanied immigrant youth in the city, ranging from infants to 17 years old.\n\nGarcia said only one shelter has reported positive cases of the coronavirus.

But if the cap stays around $81.5 million \u2014 which players were reportedly informed recently will likely be the case \u2014 general manager Stan Bowman\u2019s situation could get even more dire.\n\nThat could affect the Hawks\u2019 ability to re-sign pending free agents such as Dylan Strome, Dominik Kubalik and Corey Crawford.\n\nBut it also could \u2014 alternately, or perhaps simultaneously \u2014 lead to one or two buyouts of Hawks players with years left on their contracts.\n\nUnder the standard buyout rules \u2014 which are complicated and highly variable but generally spread out a player\u2019s expected cap hit over more years at a lower amount per year \u2014 the Hawks have two prime candidates: defenseman Olli Maatta and forward Zack Smith.\n\nMaatta was acquired from the Penguins last summer to help fix the Hawks\u2019 defense. He didn\u2019t have an outright bad debut season, but he made little difference. Maatta finished with 17 points and a 47.5 percent scoring-chance ratio (per Natural Stat Trick) in 65 games.\n\nHe has two years remaining at an expensive $4.08 million cap hit per year, and it just so happens that his contract is buyout-friendly.

He finished with 11 points and a team-worst 40.4 percent scoring-chance ratio in 50 games, then was ruled out for the season with a back injury.\n\nHis contract is slightly less buyout-friendly than Maatta\u2019s, but he\u2019s also a far more expendable player.

The league offered these in the 2013 and 2014 offseasons after the 2012-13 lockout stalled cap growth.\n\nIn this scenario, the choice would be clear for the Hawks: Brent Seabrook\u2019s contract is an albatross. He\u2019s due $6.875 million for four more seasons. Despite Seabrook\u2019s admirable fight back from three surgeries during the winter, Bowman would be delusional not to use a compliance buyout on the one-time defensive stalwart.\n\nBrent Seabrook Compliance Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2021-22 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2022-23 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2023-24 6,875,000 0 6,875,000\n\nBut a conventional buyout remains impractical. Most of Seabrook\u2019s cap hit is packed into a signing bonus that can\u2019t be mitigated in any way.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":343,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/16\/health\/n95-masks-decontaminated-coronavirus.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-16","author":"['James Gorman']","title":"Disposable N95 Masks Can Be Decontaminated, Researchers Confirm","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/04\/16\/science\/16VIRUS-MASKS\/16VIRUS-MASKS-facebookJumbo.jpg","body_text":"Researchers have confirmed that there are several effective methods for decontaminating the N95 masks worn by health professionals so that they can be used more than once, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday.\nA substantial body of research already showed that the masks, designed for one-time use, can be reused in a crisis. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March authorized reuse because of shortages driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent weeks the Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency approvals for several systems of mask decontamination.\nNone of these rules or methods are intended for the cloth masks recommended or in some locations required for use by everyone in public. The C.D.C. advises regular washing of homemade fabric masks in a washing machine.\nEarlier research had not, of course, involved the new coronavirus. The new research, done at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and used live novel coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, to test the mask material. The study determined which decontamination procedures were most effective, and how they affected the integrity of the masks.\nVincent Munster, one of the authors of the new work, who collaborated with other government researchers and scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the work built on more than a decade of studies of decontamination. \u201cWe showed that it actually works as well for SARS-CoV-2 as for influenza,\u201d and for bacteria, he said.\nThe research was posted on MedRxiv, a website where scientists have been posting articles submitted for publication elsewhere that have not yet been through peer review. But N.I.H. publicized the study because it could be helpful to health care professionals in the midst of a crisis, and it was validating and extending previous work, not suggesting untried methods.\nDr. Munster and his colleagues tested four methods of killing the virus: UV light, dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and ethyl alcohol. Of those methods, they did not recommend ethyl alcohol because although it killed the virus, it degraded the mask material.\nThe researchers first tested samples of N95 material to which live virus had been applied. That work was done in a biosecure lab. After treatment, they cultured virus particles from the material to see if the shielding remained effective in limiting transmission.\nThen they tested the same methods on whole masks without the virus to determine whether their structure and functioning were damaged after rounds of decontamination.\nDr. Munster said that even if decontamination worked perfectly, but the mask no longer fit \u201cthen obviously your mask is not really good for reuse anymore.\u201d\nVaporized hydrogen peroxide, a method often available in large hospitals, was effective, and left the masks still functioning for at least three rounds of decontamination, as did UV light.\nDry heat, at 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit, was effective, but the masks withstood only two rounds of decontamination. Dr. Munster said that \u201cvaporized hydrogen peroxide would be the method of choice if that\u2019s available.\u201d However, he said, a nursing home might not have that, while for dry heat, what\u2019s needed is basically an oven.\nDr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health, said in an email that she thought the new research was an \u201cexcellent contribution.\u201d She said it was \u201chelpful to see that either VHP or UV can effectively sterilize N95 masks and make them available for reuse up to three times.\u201d\nAnother recent study from Canadian researchers, also not yet peer reviewed, confirmed the value of decontamination. It included masks of different brands and found that the material of the mask was still effective after 10 rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination.\nOne of the authors of that paper, Dr. Anand Kumar at the University of Manitoba, said that his procedure was slightly different from Dr. Munster\u2019s in that it did not test the structure and facial fit of the mask, only the filtering ability of the material.\nThe recommendations and findings in the two papers are intended to be useful for institutions that have health care workers wearing N95 masks. With personal protective equipment in short supply at many overwhelmed hospitals, some front-line workers, including doctors and nurses, have complained that masks were rationed.\nThe public has been advised not to use or try to buy N95 masks because they would be depriving health care workers of lifesaving equipment.\n\u201cAnd if they do, they shouldn\u2019t try decontaminating them,\u201d Dr. Kumar said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":347,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/04\/16\/835748673\/in-vietnam-there-have-been-fewer-than-300-covid-19-cases-and-no-deaths-heres-why","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-04-16","author":"['Michael Sullivan']","title":"In Vietnam, There Have Been Fewer Than 300 COVID-19 Cases And No Deaths.

The country quickly came up with a variety of tactics, including widespread quarantining and aggressive contact tracing. It has also won praise from the World Health Organization and the CDC for its transparency in dealing with the crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc recently characterized Vietnam's efforts as the \"spring general offensive of 2020,\" a reference to the 1968 Tet Offensive, which many claim helped turn the tide of the Vietnam War.\n\nTens of thousands have been put in quarantine camps. By the end of March, Vietnam had banned all international and domestic flights. The government locked down the country on April 1. State-run media say the current social distancing and stay-at-home orders are to be extended for at least another week.\n\nStreets normally buzzing with motorcycles and cars are almost empty in most large cities. As the economic toll of the lockdown becomes apparent, some entrepreneurs are stepping up to help. One has provided \"rice ATMs\" to dispense free rice to those who are out of work.\n\nSome may still be skeptical of Vietnam's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers. The CDC's MacArthur is not.\n\n\"Our team up in Hanoi is working very, very closely with their Ministry of Health counterparts,\" he says. \"The communications I've had with my Vietnam team is that at this point in time, [they] don't have any indication that those numbers are false.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":357,"url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/17\/business\/stock-market-live-coronavirus.html","publisher":"The New York Times","publish_date":"2020-04-17","author":[],"title":"Stocks Rally After Talk of Reopening Economy","image":"https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2020\/04\/17\/business\/17virus-markets-briefing-sba\/17virus-markets-briefing-sba-facebookJumbo.jpg","body_text":"This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.\nCalifornia and Texas received the most small-business relief funds.\nMoney from the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data.\nThe nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state.\nThe new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent, or about $45 billion.\nAdjusting for the total amount of money that small businesses pay their employees and would be eligible to receive in loans to cover payroll, the Great Plains states emerge as big winners, with Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas receiving disproportionate shares of the money. By that metric, Nebraska did twice as well as New York.\nThe S.B.A. program was intended for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure benefited companies with existing relationships with banks.\nS.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan \u2014 suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses.\nStocks jump as investors rally behind the idea of reopening the economy.\nStocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe gains came after President Trump told governors on Thursday that they could begin reopening businesses in their states by May 1 or earlier, and Boeing \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers \u2014 said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production.\nThe announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the coronavirus outbreak forced companies and government officials to shut down most nonessential work. Boeing\u2019s shares rose more than 14 percent on Friday.\nSome European automakers \u2014 including Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler \u2014 are planning to restart assembly lines next week, staffed by workers in masks and protective clothing, sometimes separated from one another by plastic screens.\nOpel, a unit of the French automaker PSA, said it would reopen its German dealerships on Monday after the German government announced that it would gradually ease lockdown restrictions.\nThe S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing\u2019s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.\nAfter global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the damage caused by stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. The gains on Friday mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claims.\nThe S&P 500 is now up more than 28 percent from its lowest point this year, which was reached on March 23. It is still nearly 18 percent below its high in late February.\nOn Friday, the rally came after China reported that its economy \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest after that of the United States \u2014\u00a0shrank for the first time in decades. And data on car sales in Europe showed they collapsed.\nSome also saw hopeful signs in a report by the medical news website STAT that a drug from Gilead Sciences showed early \u2014 and, thus far, unproven \u2014 promise in fighting the coronavirus. According to STAT, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, has helped patients with severe symptoms recover rapidly in a clinical trial at a Chicago hospital. Gilead\u2019s shares jumped nearly 10 percent.\nThe Trump administration plans to funnel $19 billion to farmers.President Trump said Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers that have been hurt by the fallout from coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China.\nThe Trump administration will make $16 billion in direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from coronavirus, Mr. Trump said in a briefing Friday evening. It would also purchase a further $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed through food banks and other community and faith organizations to people in need, he added.\n\u201cThese are great people, great Americans,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, that was over a period of time, and they never complained.\u201d\nOver the past year, the Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers to help offset the pain of a trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world\u2019s largest markets.\nMore news media outlets lay off workers.\nThe news media industry continues to be shellacked by the dismal advertising market as businesses remain shuttered throughout much of the country. The New York Times now estimates that approximately 33,000 workers in the media industry have been affected by planned layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs, up from 28,000 last week.\nThe magazine company Cond\u00e9 Nast announced on Monday that it was cutting the pay of nearly half its work force by 10 to 20 percent. The newspaper chain Advance Local \u2014 which shares a corporate parent with Cond\u00e9 \u2014 said this week that it would furlough employees for one to two weeks.\nDigital sites, whose subscription businesses are often immature or nonexistent, continue to impose cost-savings as a way to stanch the bleeding in the ad market. Slate, which converted its membership program, Slate Plus, into a paywall last month, is cutting all employees\u2019 pay on a sliding scale. Vox Media, which purchased New York Media last year, is furloughing roughly 10 percent of its work force and cutting the pay of high-earning employees.\nThe Los Angeles Times, one of the country\u2019s largest newspapers by circulation, announced internally this week that it was furloughing 40 non-newsroom workers and cutting senior managers\u2019 pay. It also shuttered three community weeklies, laying off 14 people, including guild members.\nThe ride-sharing business has collapsed.\nIn February, Uber said it had expected to bring in $16 billion to $17 billion in revenue this year. On Thursday, the company said it could no longer forecast what will happen.\nLyft has not yet made a similar announcement, but there\u2019s no reason to think it faces a different fate.\nDrawing from aggregated debit and credit card purchases of millions of U.S. consumers, for example, the analytics firm Second Measure found that spending on Uber\u2019s rides dropped about 83 percent in March. And earnings tracker service Gridwise, using data collected from more than 30,000 drivers nationwide, found that the average hourly earnings of drivers dropped 36 percent from the beginning of March to the middle of the month. By the end of March, wages began to recover slightly, but were still down 24 percent.\nSo how are the companies dealing with the slump? For now, the strategy appears to be: Wait it out, and deliver food \u2014 as much of it as possible.\nUber\u2019s money-losing food delivery service, Uber Eats, most likely surpassed Uber\u2019s ride-hailing business in sales by mid-March and jumped about 27 percent for the month, according to Second Measure.\nAlthough Lyft had no food delivery business before the pandemic, it created a temporary one to deliver meals and groceries for students and seniors. And on Wednesday, Lyft expanded the program to 11 major cities, including Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco and Seattle.\nWhat to know about the proliferation of frauds around the coronavirus.\nFrauds around the coronavirus include businesses selling intravenous vitamin C drips to \u201cboost immunity\u201d to the virus, websites offering masks that never arrive and even reports of fake drive-up testing sites, where impostors swabbed people\u2019s cheeks in exchange for cash.\nHere are some questions and answers about coronavirus-related fraud:How can I protect myself from coronavirus fraud?First, understand that there are currently no F.D.A.-approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, said Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner. That will, hopefully, change \u2014 but you are unlikely to hear about it first via a shady robocall. The best thing to do if you get a suspicious call is to hang up, he said.\nWhat if I am expecting a government stimulus payment?Most people don\u2019t have to do anything to get their economic stimulus payments, which the government is issuing to help people facing money troubles because of the virus. Those payments will be deposited into your bank account automatically, the I.R.S. said.\n\u201cThe I.R.S. isn\u2019t going to call you asking to verify or provide your financial information\u201d so you can get your payment faster, the head of the agency, Chuck Rettig, said in a statement this month.\nI saw a social media report about virus-related fraud occurring door to door. Is this true?Agencies including the F.B.I. have issued public warnings about people selling fake virus test kits and \u201cunapproved treatments\u201d on \u201cdoor-to-door visits.\u201d The inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services also warned of \u201cscammers\u201d going door to door offering Covid-19 tests in exchange for personal details, like Medicare information.\nEuropean car sales plummeted in March.\nNew data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared.\nNew car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019.\nSales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent.\nCarmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales.\nGerman carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent.\nCatch up: Here\u2019s what else is happening.Boeing will resume operations on Monday in the Philadelphia area, where it produces military aircraft such as the H-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey. The work had been suspended for two weeks on April 3. On Thursday, Boeing said it planned to bring back 27,000 workers next week to facilities in Washington State to work on commercial aircraft production.Walmart said that it had hired 150,000 workers since March 19, and it pledged to hire 50,000 more. The retailer said it had received more than a million applications since its initial hiring announcement. The new workers will be hired on a temporary basis, it said, adding that many had been furloughed from other companies and were looking to bridge the gap until they returned to their original jobs.The organizers behind San Diego Comic Con, the annual pop culture celebration, announced on Friday that the event was canceled, the first time in its 50-year history. Fans who purchased badges can request a refund or transfer their badges to next year\u2019s event.Ford Motor said it expected to report a $2 billion loss for the first quarter, on revenue of $34 billion. The announcement came in a regulatory filing ahead of a full quarterly report on April 28. The automaker said earlier this week that its first-quarter wholesale volume was down 21 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of the outbreak\u2019s impact on production and demand. It said last month that it was suspending its dividend and any share buybacks.General Electric\u2019s aviation leasing division said it was canceling 69 orders for Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jet, which has been grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes. Boeing received 150 Max order cancellations last month. In the first quarter, it took in four times as many order cancellations as new orders.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant, reported a big jump in sales for the quarter as consumers stocked up on paper towels, toilet paper and diapers. P&G reported that organic net sales rose five percent to $17.2 billion. The company said increased shipments in North America and some parts of Europe offset declines in some Asian markets.The coronavirus outbreak has brought China\u2019s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth to an end. The country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that the economic output shrank 6.8 percent from January through March compared to the same period last year. It\u2019s the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976, when the country was in the final days of the Cultural Revolution.Reporting was contributed by Daisuke Wakabayashi, Davey Alba, Gina Kolata, Jack Ewing, Abdi Latif Dahir, Simon Marks, Karen Weise, Julie Creswell, Marc Tracy, Elaine Yu, Kevin McKenna, Nelson D.

Many of them haven\u2019t even hit the high point of their time in the game and are still on the ascent.\n\nAt 35, left back Jonathan Bornstein still has plenty left to give on the field, but his timeline is different than his colleagues\u2019 and the end is closer than the beginning. And as COVID-19 eats away at the season, it\u2019s taking away from the moments he has left in competitive soccer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that, actually, quite a bit,\u201d Bornstein said. \u201cObviously, the closer you get to the end of your career, you almost cherish every game, every practice a little bit more. Not being able to train with the team due to extenuating circumstances is a bit of a Debbie Downer kind of a thing, but at the same time I\u2019m very thankful that my family and I are healthy and we\u2019re here with the support of the team.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say the end of Bornstein\u2019s career is imminent. He certainly doesn\u2019t think so, and the way his time in Chicago has started indicates he can still play at a high level.\n\nAfter joining the Fire last summer, Bornstein solidified a spot that had given the team trouble and helped the back line finally mesh. Bornstein\u2019s strong form carried over to the first two games of 2020, and he even scored in the Fire\u2019s 1-1 draw March 7 at New England to help secure the team\u2019s first point of the year.\n\nAs it turned out, that would be their last appearance for a long time. The pandemic halted the sports world the next week, and it\u2019s unclear when and how the season will resume and when Bornstein will be reunited with his teammates.\n\nBornstein already is looking forward to that moment, whenever it arrives. But it won\u2019t be the start of a farewell.\n\n\u201cOnce we get started again, I\u2019ll be even that much more anxious to be on the field and to be making the most of my time that I have left,\u201d Bornstein said. \u201cI try not to think too much about it because, to be honest, my goal is to play until I\u2019m 40, so I\u2019ve got another five years, if it all goes to plan. I try not to let the situation get me down as much as I can.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, nobody knows when soccer will return. Bornstein is hoping it comes back sooner than later. He\u2019d rather play in the summer than the end of 2020.

Tyson had kept the facility, its largest pork plant, open in recent days over the objections of alarmed local officials.\n\nThe plant can process 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for 3.9% of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.\n\nMore than 180 infections have been linked to the plant and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. Testing of its 2,800 workers is expected to begin Friday. Cases and hospitalizations in Black Hawk County have skyrocketed in recent days and local officials say the plant is the source of most infections.\n\nIn addition to those who have tested positive for the virus, hundreds of workers were staying home out of fear, and the plant had been running at reduced production levels.\n\nEmployers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work. While plants have added safety measures, public health experts say social distancing is virtually impossible.\n\nSeveral facilities have temporarily closed due to virus outbreaks, including a Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a JBS USA plant in Worthington, Minnesota, and a Redwood Farms Meat Processors in Estherville, Iowa. Others have stayed open or resumed production after pauses for testing and cleaning.\n\nAn estimated 25% of U.S. pork processing capacity has been closed or idled due to reduced operating speed over the past two days, said Steve Meyer, an economist with Kerns and Associates in Ames, Iowa.\n\nAs a result, prices are starting to increase and analysts warn that customers could soon see shortages of certain products at grocery stores. At the same time, hog prices are plummeting due to excess supply, devastating farmers.\n\nIn Kansas, a critical beef production state, an official said Wednesday that 168 meatpacking workers had tested positive to date. In Missouri, two rural counties that are home to several meatpacking plants reported huge spikes in infections.\n\nTyson Fresh Meats President Steve Stouffer said its Waterloo closure was driven by \u201cthe combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns.\u201d He warned of \u201csignificant ramifications\u201d for farmers, distributors and grocers in the supply chain.\n\nTyson said workers would be compensated during the shutdown and that the timing of reopening would depend on several factors, including testing.\n\nLocal officials, including Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and the Black Hawk County Board of Health, had called on Tyson or Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to temporarily close the plant. They had warned that its continued operation would exacerbate the spread of the virus in the area and that the company was endangering its workers.\n\nA 65-year-old employee in the plant\u2019s laundry department died Sunday after contracting the virus, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported.\n\nThe governor blocked local authorities from closing the plant in an April 16 order that banned social gatherings in northeastern Iowa. It granted the exclusive power to the Iowa Department of Public Health to shut down businesses over coronavirus concerns.\n\nThe governor and the department had been working with Tyson to keep the plant open.\n\nReynolds argued that the economic disruption caused by plant closures outweighed the health risks, warning that farmers might have to euthanize their pigs. She said that \u201cpeople are gonna get\u201d the virus in large workplaces but most will experience mild or no symptoms.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that for most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks, it can lead to more severe illness and even death for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems.\n\nLawmakers said an earlier closure would have better protected public health and been less harmful economically. \u201cMy concern is the impact this has had because we didn\u2019t act soon enough,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Ras Smith of Waterloo.\n\nThe governor didn\u2019t respond directly when asked Wednesday if the state should have intervened. She defended her overall response to the crisis but said, \u201cThere\u2019s always more we could have done.\u201d\n\nTyson resumed operations Tuesday at its pork plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, which had been shut down for two weeks after an outbreak infected hundreds and killed two workers.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":408,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/columnists\/2020\/4\/23\/21232594\/coronavirus-stay-home-orders-trump-immigration-vista-tower-jeanne-gang-steinberg","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-23","author":"['Neil Steinberg']","title":"Day 19,432 of the lockdown: Kidding, it only feels that way","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/8vkZSgaFiH_6YBpwiLKlHBoHfHk=\/0x2297:3482x4120\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19920360\/CV_EMPTYCHICAGO_040220_02.jpg","body_text":"My mother and I talk every day. Boulder, Colorado, which offered so much when my parents retired there, geez, more than 30 years ago, isn\u2019t quite the jubilee it was. Now in their mid-80s, they aren\u2019t charging up the trail to Wonderland Lake anymore.\n\nIt can be a frustrating conversation. Particularly when my mother is planning to go to the store. \u201cMa!\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cDon\u2019t risk your life for coconut shrimp!\u201d Or, when that doesn\u2019t work, \u201cMa! You\u2019re going to die alone, surrounded by strangers in masks.\u201d\n\nOpinion\n\nMy father is sometimes watching television when I phone \u2014 CNN, thank God, not Fox \u2014 and my mother will mention something on the screen, the latest aftershock from our president\u2019s daily twirl in the limelight, like some demented ballerina on the music box in an insecure girl\u2019s nightmare.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t watch TV news, Mom,\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cI never do.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true. Primarily because I read newspapers and follow events online, so anything on TV is repetitive. Even big breaking stories \u2014 the last time I fled to TV news was when Notre Dame burned. After 10 minutes of time-filling and tap-dancing, I bailed. What\u2019s the point? As for the president\u2019s daily 5 p.m. nervous breakdown ... \u201cFortunate the person,\u201d Soren Kierkegaard writes, \u201cwho did not need to travel to hell in order to see what the devil looks like.\u201d\n\nPeople who do make that journey, the daily descent, feel obligated to react. This has gone on years, and I\u2019m sorry, but by now those doing so seem merely slow on the uptake. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re saying that the president is lying?!? Oh, my gosh, that\u2019s awful! When did he start doing that?\u201d\n\nAnd yet. Sometimes, you must join in. State the obvious. For The Record. Yes, there is something OCD about keeping track of the president\u2019s lies. Maybe it\u2019s like baseball; to ignore even one wild pitch is to lose the fabric of the game. I understand that. Was that a strike or a ball? Hard to determine the next day. You have to pay attention now. Though I bet journalists wish they had decided to keep track of his true statements \u2014 a much shorter list.\n\nTo the matter at hand.\n\nOn Monday, he \u2014 no need to speak the name \u2014 tweeted this:\n\n\u201cIn light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens. I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Invisible Enemy.\u201d He means the virus, right? Though you can\u2019t be certain, can you?\n\nThree of my four grandparents were immigrants. Maybe yours, too. If they weren\u2019t, then somebody further down the line was. And when those people came over, be they Jewish or Italian, South American or Somalian, you know the riffraff on the pier fancied themselves as better, smarter, worthier, real Americans, because they were here already.\n\nThe old lie. His ace reliever. The horse he rode in on: \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d His \u201cLook! A squirrel!\u201d fastball. The dogs always go for it, swinging at the heels. Whenever the president has made a botch job of something \u2014 and, man, is this a botch \u2014 he winds up, lets loose \u201cbuild the wall\u201d and his followers rush off, tongues lolling.\n\nThe good news is his bad idea immediately got watered down, as it often does. By Wednesday, it was nearly meaningless, just another unwelcome fumble at Lady Liberty\u2019s crotch. By Friday, it\u2019ll be nearly forgotten, replaced by a dozen other doozies and head-scratchers, contradictions, excesses, whoppers and jaw-droppers.\n\nI\u2019m not saying ignore the news. With 45,000 Americans dead since Valentine\u2019s Day, and another 45,000 to die, easy, by Fourth of July, that would be irresponsible.\n\nBut I recommend a conscious program of distraction. Take your news, then take a break. Wednesday, I got my hands on an advance copy of an upcoming book about Jeanne Gang, the rock star Chicago architect, and her Studio Gang. I immediately began reading \u2014 to give you a full accounting before its publication date in June, but also to go somewhere else for a little while. This year, 2020, will always be the year of COVID-19. But 2020 will also be the year Gang\u2019s 101-story Vista Tower opens.

They checked and rechecked their data, as if the world were depending on it. Because in some ways, it is.\nFor the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results.\nThese tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws.\nThe research has not been peer-reviewed and is subject to revision. But the results are already raising difficult questions about the course of the epidemic.\nSurveys of residents in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York this week found that substantial percentages tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. In New York City, the figure was said to be as high as 21 percent. Elsewhere, it was closer to 3 percent.\nThe idea that many residents in some parts of the country have already been exposed to the virus has wide implications. At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy.\nAlready Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns. Public health experts are wondering if those with positive results might be allowed to return to work.\nBut these tactics mean nothing if the test results can\u2019t be trusted.In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive \u2014 that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them.\nTwo other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time.But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best.\nThe false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures.\nIt is also the result on which scientists are most divided.\u201cThere are multiple tests that look reasonable and promising,\u201d said Dr. Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the project\u2019s leaders. \u201cThat\u2019s some reason for optimism.\u201d\nDr. Marson is also an investigator in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which partly funded the study.Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent.\n\u201cThose numbers are just unacceptable,\u201d said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe tone of the paper is, \u2018Look how good the tests are.\u2019 But I look at these data, and I don\u2019t really see that.\u201d\nThe proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. \u201cIf your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It\u2019s basically impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your kit has 14 percent false positive, it\u2019s useless.\u201d\nDr. Hensley said the study nonetheless was well designed and the results pressing, given the sudden proliferation of antibody tests on the market and the push to use them to lift lockdowns.\n\u201cI think this is exactly the kind of study that we need right now,\u201d he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues said they were drawn to the study for that very reason.\nAs universities in the Bay Area shut down all research not related to the coronavirus, some researchers began focusing on ways to improve diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.\nDr. Marson and his collaborator, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley, anticipated that antibody tests would also face questions about quality.\nIn mid-March, Dr. Hsu heard that a friend, a venture capitalist who owns a network of 1,000 community clinics in the New York area, had ordered thousands of rapid antibody tests. Investors and entrepreneurs seemed to be distributing them around San Francisco, too.\n\u201cI realized, \u2018Gosh this is really the Wild West,\u2019\u201d Dr. Hsu said. \u201cWe needed to figure out which of these would really work.\u201d\nThe duo recruited Dr. Jeffrey Whitman and Dr. Caryn Bern, who last year published an analysis of antibody tests for Chagas disease. Other graduate students and postdoctoral fellows volunteered to help perform the evaluations.\nThe team began with a modified version of the method Dr. Whitman had devised to validate Chagas tests. The researchers created a biosafety-certified space, obtained the needed approvals and procured hundreds of blood samples from two Bay Area hospitals.\nThey also purchased tests from Chinese manufacturers, clearing customs regulations and sometimes accepting Uber deliveries in the middle of the night.\nIn all, the investigators analyzed 10 rapid tests that deliver a yes-no signal for antibodies, and two tests using a lab technique known as Elisa that indicate the amount of antibodies present and are generally considered to be more reliable.\nSuited up in protective gear, the team worked in shifts of three to five hours in a sort of socially distanced factory line.\nOne researcher spotted the test with a blood sample, and another added the necessary chemical solutions; then two independent readers looked at the test, and a last person recorded the results. Still other team members analyzed the results, sometimes working through the night.\nIn the early hours of recent mornings, they handed the baton to Dr. Tyler Miller and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were conducting a slightly different analysis of three tests, including one evaluated in San Francisco.\nThe Bay Area team finished evaluating 12 tests in record time, less than a month. By comparison, the Chagas project required a team of three people working for more than a year just to compare four tests.\nHaving a study design already in hand helped speed the work, but there was one key difference. Decades of data have shown that Chagas disease elicits lifelong immunity. For this study, the team had no idea how quickly SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might turn up in the blood, or at what levels.\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a \u201chead-to-head bake-off to see who\u2019s the winner,\u201d Dr. Hsu said.\nEach test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nTests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives.\nA test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said.\nThe lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said.\nThe tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity.\n\u201cYou can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,\u201d Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however.\nThe results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. \u201cThere are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.\u201d\nRapid antibody tests are generally used to get a simple yes-no result, but the team assigned the positive results \u2014 which appear as bands on a test strip \u2014 a score from zero to six. They trained readers to interpret those results, and found their decisions often agreed and were supported by the more quantitative Elisa tests.\n\u201cIf you train the readers well, they can start to be reliable,\u201d Dr. Marson said of rapid tests. \u201cThat is critical to understand if these tests could ever be deployed.\u201d\nThe team at Mass General set a higher bar for specificity; they considered a score of one for the intensity of a band to be a negative result, rather than a score of zero.\nPerhaps because they eliminated the fainter bands \u2014 the ones most likely to be erroneous \u2014 their estimate of specificity for BioMedomics, the one test that was evaluated by both teams, was more than 99 percent, compared with the San Francisco team\u2019s estimate of 87 percent.\nOther experts were skeptical of the scoring approach, however. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a method that would give you a real quantitation,\u201d said Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.\nDr. Krammer has developed a two-step Elisa test that he said has 100 percent specificity and delivers a measure of the quantity of IgM and IgG antibodies a person has. Scoring a rapid test\u2019s bands might offer some data for a scientific study, he said, \u201cbut I would not make any decisions based on that.\u201d\nDr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said.\nBut false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anybody back to work who has a false positive \u2014 that\u2019s the last thing you want to do,\u201d Dr. Krammer said.\nScanwell Health, a Los Angeles-based start-up, has ordered millions of test kits from Innovita, a Chinese manufacturer, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market the tests for at-home use.\nIn the new study, the Innovita test detected antibodies in 83 percent of infected people and yielded a false-positive rate of 4 percent.\nDr. Jack Jeng, chief medical officer of Scanwell Health, said the study looked at an earlier version of Innovita\u2019s test and not the \u201cnewer, improved version\u201d his company had ordered. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how it performs,\u201d he said.\nDr. Marson and his colleagues have acquired tests from nearly 100 manufacturers, and plan to continue comparing them. The scientists also hope to expand their sample set to include people who were mildly ill or did not feel ill at all, and to stratify their data by age and the presence of chronic conditions.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Dr. Marson said. \u201cOur goal would be to keep going till we feel there\u2019s adequate supply in the market.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":434,"url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/coronavirus-asteroid-flying-past-earth-next-week-wearing-face-mask\/","publisher":"CBS News","publish_date":"2020-04-24","author":"['Sophie Lewis']","title":"Massive asteroid flying past Earth next week looks like it's wearing a face mask","image":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/04\/24\/66831e9d-9414-4219-8a7d-9c9e4fa55417\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/3ac6aa4fc3fa5c373e0ea0a8ebd2c1fd\/asteroidmaskphoto.jpg","body_text":"If you're planning to visit Earth in the year 2020, it's important to be wearing a face mask to protect yourself from the coronavirus.

After its discovery, NASA said it is \"large enough to cause global effects\" if it impacted Earth, but poses no threat to the planet.\n\nAnd it won't be the only time the asteroid pays Earth a visit. And next time, it'll come a little closer.\n\n\"The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,\" says Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory. \"In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.\"\n\nArecibo said that scientists continue to monitor asteroids for planetary defense purposes, but are following proper social distancing guidelines and wearing masks while making observations.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":440,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/25\/21236141\/dyson-ventilator-25-million-covid-19-coronavirus-ford-tesla-gm","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-04-25","author":"['Kim Lyons']","title":"Dyson says UK doesn\u2019t need the ventilator it developed for COVID-19 patients","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/POvXo1f9eKGgil4zjKIPgrE4Oyo=\/0x15:780x423\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19834703\/200326111901_01_dyson_covent_ventilator_exlarge_169.jpg","body_text":"After spending about $25 million on the project, British technology company Dyson says the UK government doesn\u2019t need the ventilator it developed to help treat COVID-19 patients, Reuters reported.

More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation. College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall. Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside! Biden to announce a \"committee\" to evaluate VP candidates? Come on!\n\nYes, let's waste billions of dollars \u2014 and even risk lives \u2014 in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. This is the best and fastest way to find one.\n\nA lab technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at \"Fire Eye\" laboratory in Wuhan in China's central Hubei Province. Getty\n\nInsider's Bill Bostock reports that the world's largest vaccine maker is going to manufacture 40 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate this summer, even though the vaccine hasn't been tested yet, might not be safe, or might not work. That's great news.\n\nThis is just one of what promise to be many apparently wasteful and risky attempts to create a vaccine \u2014 most of which will fail. Other pharma and biotech firms like Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are similarly ramping up vaccine manufacturing, before they know if the shots will work.\n\nBill Gates has proposed spending billions of dollars to build multiple vaccine-manufacturing plants to scale up production of seven different untested vaccines, though only one is likely to be effective. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is going to spend $2 billion to accelerate production of several vaccine candidates, most of which will likely go to waste.\n\nOthers propose to risk human lives to speed up vaccine testing. Some leading scientists want to launch \"human challenge\" trials for coronavirus vaccines. In these trials, volunteers would be given experimental vaccines or a placebo and then deliberately exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nThis would massively accelerate knowledge about whether the vaccine works, because we wouldn't have to wait months to see if the test subjects contract the disease in the normal course of life. But some of the volunteer subjects would also fall ill \u2014 especially if it's a placebo trial \u2014 and given how terrible COVID-19 is, some would likely die. This is also especially worrying in the current context because we have no effective treatment to help those who do get sick.\n\nWasting money and potentially harming people obviously aren't good. But, right now, the risks are worth it. That's because our enemy is time.\n\nThe normal processes of pharmaceutical research \u2014 manufacturing only when you know a drug works, and only testing in the safest ways \u2014 make sense in normal situations. But every day we don't have a vaccine, thousands die, billions of dollars in economic activity are lost, and human welfare declines. Our future selves become poorer and sicker.\n\nSo there is literally almost nothing we shouldn't try to get us a vaccine quicker, even if that means building factories that make vaccines that don't work and conducting potentially deadly trials on volunteers. \u2014DP\n\nMore corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation from the '90s\n\nWe now have more corroboration of the sexual-assault allegation against then-Sen. Biden in 1993.\n\nRich McHugh writes in Insider that a neighbor of Tara Reade, the former Biden staffer who recently filed a criminal complaint accusing him of assaulting her in a hallway, has come forward to corroborate her story.\n\nThe neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, says Reade told her about the alleged incident in 1995 or 1996, a few years after Reade says it occurred. LaCasse said Reade shared with her many of the same details that Reade has recently alleged.\n\nLaCasse says Reade did not ask her to come forward now. She adds that she is a Democrat and plans to vote for Biden. She says she came forward because she believes it was the right thing to do.\n\nA second corroborator, Lorraine Sanchez, was a colleague of Reade's in a California state senator's office after she left Washington DC. Sanchez says Reade told her that her former boss in Washington had harassed her. Sanchez did not recall whether Reade went into detail.\n\nBiden's campaign has said Reade's allegation is false. Biden himself has not commented on it. He's going to have to.\n\nRead Rich McHugh's latest report here.\n\nCollege presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall\n\nThe Purdue marching band. Chris T Pehlivan \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowded parties, football stadiums, dorms, lecture halls \u2026 colleges are paradise for a zealous coronavirus, which is why they all shut down, and fast, in March. But most universities and colleges can't afford to stay closed for long. They carry huge faculty and staff costs, and own expensive physical plants.\n\nColleges also depend on tuition to pay their bills. And most can't simply transition to remote learning, because students won't stand for it. They're paying for the college experience, for working together in labs and studios, living together in dorms.\n\nSo it's expected \u2014 and encouraging \u2014 that we're now seeing a rush of college presidents pushing bold ideas about how to reopen in the fall, even without a coronavirus vaccine or treatment.\n\nIn an inspiring letter, president Mitch Daniels said Purdue University is \"determined not to surrender helplessly to those [COVID-19] difficulties but to tackle and manage them aggressively and creatively.\" Daniels argues that the virus is not an intolerable risk for the young. He proposes to test everyone in August, reopen campus for those under 35 years old, segregate those older than 35 or at particular risk from the general population, and track and contact trace the infected.\n\nWill it work? Who knows? But it's heartening to see this kind of practical problem-solving from one of the world's greatest engineering schools. We're not going to learn how to live with the virus without some creative, even unorthodox thinking, and it makes sense to use universities \u2014 which are the front lines of American research, after all \u2014 as laboratories.\n\nFor example, Brown University president Christina Paxson acknowledges that reopening colleges will almost certainly require using technology that infringes on civil liberties to vigorously track students and faculty. That seems like an infringement worth a test, and no better place to try it out than in the limited space of a campus.\n\nWhat Purdue president Daniels doesn't say is that the decision by some schools to reopen will put pressure on other schools, since no college will want to risk losing its students to rivals that have reopened. But not every college will have the resources to test and track in the way Purdue or Brown can, so there will definitely be campus COVID-19 clusters in the fall. \u2014DP\n\nOpen the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside!\n\nFort Greene Park on April 23, 2020, in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Mike Lawrie\/Getty Images\n\nAs pressure builds for lockdowns to be relaxed or dropped, it's time to get more sophisticated about which measures actually have a big effect on slowing the coronavirus and which don't.\n\nConcentrating our efforts on measures that really matter, while giving us more freedom by relaxing those that don't, will enable us to keep the crucial tactics in place for longer.\n\nSo here's a suggestion:\n\nRelax restrictions that encourage or compel people to stay indoors.\n\nThe virus spreads primarily by droplets getting from one infected person's nose and mouth to another person's, in sufficient quantities and duration to cause an infection. Sunlight kills the virus quickly, and wind disperses it. Studies suggest that transmission almost exclusively occurs indoors.\n\nAs Insider's Anna Medaris Miller explains, experts are confident that being outside is low risk, especially when you are properly distanced. When you're distanced and wearing a mask, in fact, it would take something amounting to a \"freak accident\" for you to catch the virus or infect someone else outside, even if you passed close by each other.\n\nA new study from China underscores this. It looked at 318 \"outbreaks\" that involved three or more cases. Not a single one of these infections occurred outdoors. (Most of them occurred within homes, with one family member infecting others. It has another important implication for more sophisticated distancing measures \u2014 namely, creating isolation and quarantine facilities outside of homes \u2014 but we'll leave that for another day.)\n\nIn a broader look at 7,324 cases, in fact, the researchers found only one case in which infection appears to have occurred outdoors. It involved two people in a village who had a conversation after one of them returned from a visit to Wuhan.\n\nTo be clear: It's not impossible to catch or transmit the virus outside. But it's rare. And with minimal precautions \u2014 some distancing and a mask \u2014 it should be extremely rare.\n\nMeanwhile, going outside has all sorts of psychological and physiological benefits, including allowing us to feel more free and less trapped. As Anna Medaris Miller posits, even experts who fully support distancing measures believe that these benefits offset the risks. Respected Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch \u2014 who generally supports strict distancing measures \u2014 believes there is a net benefit to keeping open spaces open.\n\nSo open the parks!\n\nAnd go outside! \u2014HB\n\nEveryone's eager to know who VP Biden will choose as his running mate.\n\nInstead of just making the decision and then telling us the answer, however, Biden reportedly plans to first announce the selection of a \"committee\" who will evaluate the candidates.\n\nYes, the Trump habit of dismissing experts and making impulsive decisions with minimal consideration based on his own \"gut instinct\" leads to imprecision and mistakes. And, yes, the country is suffering for this.\n\nBut announcing a committee to evaluate potential VP candidates is going too far the other way.\n\nOf course Biden should have a team evaluate prospective candidates. But he doesn't need to announce in advance who these people are. He also doesn't need to remind Americans that Democrats have a reputation for being overly bureaucratic in their decision-making. \u2014HB","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":454,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/4\/27\/21239139\/troy-sneed-dies-grammy-nominated-gospel-singer-from-coronavirus-complications","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-27","author":[],"title":"Troy Sneed, Grammy-nominated gospel singer, dies at 52 from coronavirus complications","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/iNL3ufuSBYdZYQpCSyd6jV8i2n4=\/0x0:2794x1463\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19929306\/Obit_Troy_Sneed.jpg","body_text":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Grammy-nominated gospel singer Troy Sneed has died from complications with the coronavirus.

Gilbert Villegas (36th) said he convened a Monday meeting between the building owner and the commander of the CPD\u2019s Grand Central District, who issued the woman \u201ca couple citations for public nuisance and gave her strict warnings and we also have just put her on notice.\u201d\n\nVideo footage of the weekend party in the 2000 block of North Narragansett quickly went viral. Clips posted to Facebook showed dozens of people crammed into the home, with everyone standing in very close proximity and hardly anyone wearing protective masks.\n\nVillegas \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s floor leader in City Council \u2014 said the party was the doing of the building owner\u2019s adult son. The owner\u2019s son had a set of keys to the building and was able to disarm the home\u2019s alarm system. It was the second party he\u2019s thrown in the building in recent weeks, Villegas said.\n\nThe home, in Chicago\u2019s Galewood community, is in Villegas\u2019 ward.\n\nEarlier in the day, Lightfoot vowed to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of the party \u2014 and hold everyone involved accountable for the public health risk.\n\nLightfoot said the city is \u201cstill in the midst of the investigation to identify the specific location\u201d of the party, captured on a shocking Facebook video that already had been viewed more than a million times before it was taken down Monday.\n\nThe party is believed to have taken place somewhere on the West Side, but City Hall is still \u201cnailing down specifics,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mayor argued \u201ceverybody involved\u201d in the party \u201cbears a level of responsibility\u201d and will ultimately be held accountable.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a scene like that where you have, literally, it looked to me, like hundreds of people gathered in a small, confined space literally cheek-to-jowl like that, it goes against all of the things we\u2019ve been talking about. All of the things that the vast majority of Chicagoans understand and know,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cThey put themselves at risk. But not only that. Every single person there who put themselves at risk puts the next person and the next person that they come into contact with at risk. That\u2019s why, for me, that scene is so distressing. But, we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nLightfoot pointed to \u201cZoom chats\u201d and other opportunities for young people to connect using social media. She said the city plans to \u201cstep up and do a lot over the course of the summer, depending on where we are in the arc of this virus\u201d and how much the stay-at-home order is relaxed. But she argued a shortage of organized teen activities is no excuse to flout the statewide, stay-at-home order.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in that scene was just foolish and reckless. There\u2019s got to be a level of personal responsibility for that. Millenials aren\u2019t children. Millenials\u2014many of `em\u2014are in their 20\u2019s. They\u2019re fully functioning adults. And we expect adults to act responsibly\u2014particularly at a time of pandemic,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nVideographer Tink Purcell captured the chaotic Saturday night party scene from halfway up a staircase and streamed it live on Facebook for about 24 minutes.\n\nSome partygoers were wearing face masks, but most were not. Social distancing was out the window as those in attendance danced and drank elbow-to-elbow while lines formed at the front door and on the stairs.\n\nThe mayor was asked how she plans to prevent similarly unauthorized house parties as temperatures rise and cabin fever builds.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t prevent people from being foolish. I wish I had that kind of power. What we can do ... is educate people about why taking those kinds of risks are unnecessary and foolish, talk about personal responsibility and then, where we see it, take decisive action and make sure that we shut it down,\u201d Lightfoot said.\n\n\u201cI have no compunction about setting the appropriate example in egregious situations like we saw. Not just in that event, but there were several other large-scale parties that the police department was called upon to break up over the weekend. We\u2019re not gonna set the standard for the summer and warmer weather by allowing people to flout all the public health guidance we\u2019ve been giving.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":463,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/in-depth\/news\/2020\/04\/27\/how-clean-care-for-store-and-reuse-masks-protect-coronavirus-n-95-elastometric-homemade-covid-19\/5148025002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-04-27","author":"['Karina Zaiets', 'Ramon Padilla']","title":"How to clean, reuse or hack a coronavirus mask","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/04\/23\/USAT\/e84fc7d9-c768-440b-8462-1f7be90a7637-promo-art.png?crop=4732,2662,x1440,y876&width=1200","body_text":"The CDC recommends wearing a face mask that covers your nose and mouth when leaving your home for essentials like groceries and prescriptions. Some types of masks are not intended for reuse, but there are a few things you can do to sanitize them, upgrade filtration and extend their lives. Here are some strategies that will help you get the most out of your mask, and keep you and your family safe.\n\nLet's say you just got back from the grocery store wearing your mask. Now what?\n\n1. Treat your mask like a biohazard.\n\nIsolate it from the rest of your family. \u201cYou don't want to be leaving it on the kitchen counter or the coffee table where other people may inadvertently be handling it,\u201d says Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n2. Wash your hands with soap every time you remove or even touch the mask.\n\nAct as if the virus is on both sides of the fabric. Make sure to wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds.\n\nThose are coronavirus mask basics.\n\nThere\u2019s much more to know, though, if you want to extend the life of your gear or even make your own mask.\n\nHow to clean homemade cloth face masks and the best material to make one\n\nTo clean your mask, run it through the washing machine and dryer after use. The water doesn't necessarily needs to be hot but make sure to use a laundry detergent.\n\nIf you don't have access to a washing machine, you can hand-wash using soap. Another option: Put the mask into a paper bag and leave it in a warm place for at least two days. After that, the virus will become inactive and won\u2019t be infectious.\n\nWhen you are wearing a homemade mask, you should keep in mind that you are not wearing the mask to protect yourself, but to minimize the spread of virus particles to others. Even if you feel no effects, you may be asymptomatic.\n\nHomemade masks are less effective at protecting the wearer because most have voids, or spaces near your nose and cheeks where the tiny droplets can be inhaled, and the pores in the fabric alone are generally not small enough to trap tiny aerosolized droplets.\n\nSome materials make better masks than than others. According to a study published in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, homemade masks made from a kitchen towel proved to be the most effective at removing particles.\n\nOn the other hand, T-shirts or pillowcases may be the best choice as they can provide a better fit by stretching. Avoid using old fabrics because washing and drying may stretch the pores, allowing more particles to get in.\n\nThe choice of fabric is very important. Professor Koehler suggests using tightly woven fabric folded in multiple layers. A research paper published in PeerJ confirms the fabric concern. The study looked at the surface of 20 different types of cloth masks and found the size of pores in masks ranged from 80 to 500 micrometers. For comparison, the novel coronavirus is about 0.12 micrometers:\n\nYou may also want to avoid thick materials like vacuum cleaner bags. A material with high resistance will force air to escape through routes around the mask fabric creating a void. Also, breathing through a thick mask can be tough on your heart and lungs. This could put elderly people and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions at risk.\n\n\"It shouldn't be so difficult that you just can't physically breathe, but you should notice some resistance in your breathing,\" Dr. Koehler said. \"Otherwise your mask is probably not doing anything.\"\n\nAdding any sort of filtering inside the mask may help to reinforce it and add additional protection. An engineer specializing in aerodynamics has tested the effectiveness of paper towels. A single layer captured 23% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. Adding an extra layer increased particle capture to 33%.\n\nPhillip Clapp, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina, has been testing various homemade masks. When he studied three layers of cotton fabric, he saw that the material itself had efficiency of around 90%. However, once he wore the mask made from that material, its efficiency dropped below 50%.\n\n\"And what that tells us is that it really has to do with how well that mask will fit your face, as to how well you'll be protected,\" Dr. Clapp said.\n\nThe mask should cover both your nose and mouth. The CDC has published several tutorials on making face masks, which include masks with elastic ear loops as well as tie strings. If you choose to make a mask with tie strings, it's important to make sure the straps fit correctly around the head so the mask does not fall down.\n\nWhen wearing a mask, secure the bottom ties first with a bow around the nape of your neck. Then, pull the mask by the upper ties over your mouth and chin and secure around your head.\n\nPreliminary results from a study by researchers at Northeastern University show that sewn fabric masks can in some cases approach the filtration efficiency of commercially produced masks.\n\nAdding an elastic outer layer improved fit for all mask types tested. Particularly helpful was adding an outer layer made from nylon stockings. Even surgical masks were found to perform better with stockings during the study.\n\nYou should not clean an N95 mask at home. But you can reuse it with proper care. Here's how:\n\nThe general public is asked not to purchase N95 respirators due to shortages in the medical supply. But if you have one, they offer good protection. The key with the N95 respirator is proper fit: There should be no air gaps or voids around the nose, cheeks or chin.\n\nAccording to Koehler, some data suggests that the virus could live on N95 respirators up to seven days, as opposed to about two days for the cloth fabrics.\n\nShe recommends using a method that isolates the mask in a breathable location:\n\nNever use cleaning products such as Lysol, alcohol or bleach. Liquid, including soap and water, can damage the mesh of electrically charged fibers designed to catch particles and droplets.\n\nCan you use expired face masks and respirators?\n\nExpired N95 respirators remain as effective as the new ones, Clapp said. He tested respirators that were as far as 11 years behind the expiration date. While the respirator may still filter particles as good as new, elastic bands that may deteriorate.\n\nCan you clean and reuse disposable surgical masks? Sort of. Here's how:\n\nSurgical masks are intended to protect the wearer\u2019s face from large droplets and splashes of blood and other body fluids. Efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% depending on the manufacturer and the type of the mask. According to Clapp, surgical masks with ear loops (38.9% effective) performed worse than surgical masks with tie strings (71.5% effective.)\n\nGenerally, surgical masks are less effective than N95 respirators because they don\u2019t provide a seal around the nose and mouth, which could allow smaller droplets to get in. At the same time, studies show that they are better than homemade masks at protecting from larger particles.\n\nAna Rule, an assistant professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, recommends not buying surgical masks to ensure enough supply for health care workers. Wear one only if you have it already at home.\n\nHow to reuse: The best strategy is to isolate it for a week in a breathable container such as a paper bag. Putting masks in the plastic may lead to accumulation of moisture and development of bacteria. Surgical masks should not be washed, because liquid damages the filter.\n\nHow to clean and reuse elastomeric respirators\n\nWhen elastomeric respirators are properly fit tested and worn, they can provide the user with an effective face seal and will hold up to repeated use, cleaning and maintenance. As with N95 masks, use only if you already have one.\n\nHow to clean and reuse the respirator: Wipe down with alcohol swabs to disinfection after each use. The attached filter cartridges are replaceable and are easily changed. Though they can be reused, their life span depends on many factors such as exposure and concentration of particles. It's important to double check if the cartridges you have are designated for filtering coronavirus particles.\n\nUsing masks in the family\n\nThe best practice is just for one person within a family to go to a store or other places where it might be difficult to maintain social distancing. Parents should ensure that children don't touch their face, because wearing the mask may encourage them to do so. CDC recommends that children under 2 years old shouldn't wear the mask because of the risk of suffocation.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":480,"url":"https:\/\/www.pravdareport.com\/news\/russia\/144526-putin_russia_covid\/","publisher":"Pravda Report","publish_date":"2020-04-28","author":[],"title":"Putin extends non-working days as Russia is ranked 8th in Covid-19 cases","image":"https:\/\/cdn.pravda.ru\/eng\/image\/preview\/article\/\/5\/2\/6\/144526_soc.jpeg","body_text":"Putin extends isolation as Russia ranked 8th in Covid-19 cases\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced a new extension of \u201cnon-working days\u201d that were declared nationwide in order to combat the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19. Without waiting for the expiration of the previous deadline (April 30), Putin announced that all days through May 11 would be non-working days in Russia.\n\nTraditionally, Russians celebrate May holidays from May 1 till May 9 with just a few working days between them. Many prefer to take a few days off to spend a full-fledged ten-day vacation to spend it either abroad or working in gardens.\n\nPutin explained the need to prolong the tough measures to combat COVID-19 with the fact that the epidemic in Russia has not reached its peak yet.\n\n\u201cWe are now facing a new, perhaps the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic. All of us will need utmost composure, discipline and mobilization. We must make sure that the wave of the epidemic subsides and finally declines,\u201d Putin said.\n\nAnna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor (environmental watchdog), noted that during the new period of non-working days one should maintain the self-isolation regime and other restrictions.\n\n\u201cThis is the third incubation period for the entire period of non-working days that should interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus,\u201d Popova said.\n\nShe said earlier that stringent restrictions need to be extended for at least another two weeks.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop halfway. So far, we have been in the phase of severe restrictive measures for only two incubation periods for this disease. In order to stop the spread of the virus and be completely sure that we will pass the point of no return, this is absolutely not enough,\u201d Popova said.\n\nOn March 25, in his televised address to the nation in connection with the fight against the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19, the president declared a non-working week from March 30 to April 5. On April 2, the president made a new appeal to the nation, having extended the non-working regime until April 30.\n\nOn April 28, it became known that Russia left Iran behind and took the 8th place in the world in the number of officially registered patients with COVID-19. As of April 27, 93,558 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the country (+6411 over the last 24 hours), 867 people died.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":501,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/travel\/hotels\/2020\/04\/29\/coronavirus-hyatt-announces-new-cleaning-goals-following-hilton-marriott\/3046386001\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-04-29","author":"['David Oliver']","title":"Hotels, resorts announce new cleaning programs amid coronavirus.

Short-term rental company Vrbo followed suit, too.\n\nIHG, owner of hotel chains like InterContinental and Holiday Inn, followed many major hotel companies by announcing new cleanliness measures on May 18, in conjunction with Cleveland Clinic medical experts and Ecolab and Diversey hygiene experts. The in-progress changes may include hotel-wide extra deep-cleaning of high-touch surfaces, \"last cleaned\" charts and social distancing practices. Additional guidance for hotels may include Other changes might be individual amenity cleaning kits for guests, plus hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in guest rooms.\n\nFour Seasons is partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine International for its new global health and safety program, \"Lead With Care.\" The program notes that public areas will be cleaned hourly, with extra attention to areas like the front desk counters and public restrooms; kits with masks, hand sanitizer and sanitization wipes will be in each guest room; and restaurants and bars might operate at a limited capacity for social distancing purposes, among other initiatives.\n\nOmni's \"Safe & Clean\" initiative includes a daily health screening for employees, with a temperature check. The company is expanding its use of Environmental Protection Agency- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved disinfectants. Omni is increasing the cleaning of its heating and cooling systems and replacing air filters more often. High-traffic areas will become one-way where possible. Single-use items will be placed in guest rooms, and a limited-contact check-in and check-out process will become standard.\n\nCaesars Entertainment is assuring guests its employees are well-versed in cleaning and disinfectant practices, which includes PPE use. Multiple handwashing stations have been added to the resort, and both slot machine banks and table games will allow for social distancing going forward, among other changes.\n\nAccor 'ALLSAFE' plan includes temperature checks; partnership brings in telemedicine consultants\n\nAccor's \"ALLSAFE\" plan, in addition to heightened cleanliness procedures, will include temperature checks for guests and partitions at front desks. For an extra health measure, as soon as July 2020 guests will also have free access to telemedicine consultants and have access to tens of thousands of medical professionals. Accor is working with insurance company AXA Partners.\n\nMGM Resorts: Minimize drinking, no eating on the casino floor\n\nMGM launched its \"Seven-Point Safety Plan,\" a new standard created with medical and scientific experts to curb the spread of coronavirus, respond to possible new cases and keep customers and employees safe.\n\nIn addition to upgraded incident response protocols and contactless check-in, some of the company's focuses will be:\n\nScreening, temperature checks and employee training: Employees will be screened for signs and symptoms of infection, and will continue to go through temperature checks. Guests are encouraged to adhere to CDC guidelines for self-quarantine and to not travel if they think they have been exposed.\n\nMandatory masks and PPE: Employees will be given an approved mask to wear when on the property, and guests are encouraged to wear masks in public areas. Free masks will be offered to guests who need one. Guests should limit the amount of time they are drinking on the casino floor and should not eat there.\n\nPhysical distancing: Floor guides will be throughout properties making sure people adhere to six-foot distancing. But MGM is aware distancing could prove difficult. \"From time-to-time, six-foot distancing will be challenging \u2013 and in those cases, reasonable mitigating protocols will be implemented, such as plexiglass barriers or eye protection for employees,\" according to the new policy.\n\nHand washing and enhanced sanitization: On top of enhanced cleaning, MGM will deploy electrostatic sprayers for more efficient disinfecting. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will also be available in high-traffic spots, along with signage.\n\nHVAC controls and air quality: MGM has worked to minimize risk of virus transmission with HVAC systems. HVAC systems will be reviewed and adjusted pending science and government guidance.\n\nRed Roof's RediClean initiative launches\n\nThe budget hotel chain launched Red Roof RediClean, an enhanced cleanliness program to bolster guests' confidence to stay there again.\n\nRed Roof is asking its staff to be thorough when cleaning guest rooms (i.e. sanitizing TVs, doorknobs, light switches, faucets, etc.), and staff is sanitizing common areas like elevators, laundry rooms and front desks up to four times each day.\n\nThe company has made signage explaining guests need to wear a face covering in public spaces, per government rules. If local or state governments require facial coverings in common areas where social distancing is more difficult \u2014 think laundry rooms or indoor hallways \u2014 guests must adhere to that mandate. They are encouraged to do so (with signage) in states not requiring this.\n\nWyndham: 'Count on Us'\n\nWyndham, which has more than 6,000 hotels in the U.S., announced a new initiative called \"Count on Us\", which includes updated cleaning and disinfection procedures for guest rooms and public spaces, plus easy access to health essentials.\n\nThe chain will ship products including face masks for hotel employees, disinfectant wipes for guests and hand sanitizer. Wyndham is also set to partner with Ecolab to use its disinfectants across guest rooms and public spaces.\n\nBest Western announces 'We Care Clean' plan\n\nMeanwhile, Best Western's rejiggered \"We Care Clean\" plan includes enhanced sanitization procedures at the front desk and lobby, upgraded grab and go breakfast offerings in most hotels and offered more strict cleaning of public amenities like pools and fitness centers.\n\nThe hotel brand is relying on guidance from the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA and Health Canada.\n\nSandals rolls out 'Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness'\n\nSandals and Beaches Resorts, which has 24 properties in seven countries, has its own new sanitation rules. The chain's Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness Program will include precautionary temperature checks, personal anti-bacterial hand towels and individual in-room hand sanitizer, according to Sandals spokesperson Rachael Salzer. Each hotel room will be maintained using UV-LED lighting equipment to inspect cleanliness, air duct sanitization for each arrival and upon each departure and weekly carpet steam-cleaning.\n\nVrbo\n\nVrbo, part of Expedia Group, has issued guidelines informed by the CDC , the World Health Organization and Cristal International Standards. Dr. Daniel Lucey, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, advised the company. There are directives for disinfecting surfaces, ensuring time between bookings and keeping homes stocked with antibacterial hand soaps and hand sanitizers.\n\nHomeowners and property managers will have the ability to report whether guests can check in and out without person-to-person contact or if the property can't accommodate 24 hours between guests. Guests will be able to see this information on the Vrbo app and website once hosts detail the information to the company.\n\nThe company is also offering a flexible cancellation search filter.\n\nHyatt aims to introduce new cleanliness accreditation process\n\nHyatt announced cleanliness measures last week, announcing it is relying on medical experts, industry professionals and others to ensure guests feel safe.\n\n\"We must critically examine the hotel experience from every vantage point \u2013 from our rooms and our lobbies to our spas and dining \u2013 bringing in the latest research, technology and innovation to make that happen,\" Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nBy September, every Hyatt hotel is expected to have someone trained as a \"hygiene manager,\" who will make sure their hotel adheres to new guidelines.\n\nThese may include social distancing guidelines, prominent hand sanitizer placement, food safety and hygiene protocol implementation for restaurants and room service and increased cleaning frequency with hospital-grade disinfectants on high-touch surfaces, shared spaces and in guest rooms.\n\nHyatt is also developing new work procedures and trainings for its employees to address their safety and the safety of guests. This includes daily surveys that will assess colleague comfort, hotel cleanliness and more.\n\nThe company also aims to introduce a new accreditation process in May from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council across hundreds of hotels; Hyatt says it is the first to do so. This council, made up of leaders in the microbial-pathogenic threat analysis and mitigation space, is a division of ISSA, the global cleaning industry association.\n\nHyatt has been working with infectious disease and occupational health experts to develop the program.\n\nAs individual hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott, announce their cleaning initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry at large is also working to implement to new standards to make guests feel safe.\n\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) unveiled its Safe Stay guidelines on May 4, an effort made in conjunction with major brands like Hilton, Marriott and Best Western to standardize cleanliness.\n\n\"It's really an effort to make sure that no matter if you're staying at an extended-stay economy hotel or you're staying at the nicest luxury resort, that there will be at a minimum common standards across the entire industry,\" Chip Rogers, AHLA president and CEO, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe report outlines baseline hotel practices and procedures (you can find the full guidelines here) meant to protect employees and guests.\n\nHilton's new cleaning protocols\n\nHilton also said this week that it is partnering with the company behind Lysol, as well as the Mayo Clinic, to better ensure cleanliness in its hotels. The new program will be called \"Hilton CleanStay\" and aims to to give guests peace of mind when staying at a Hilton property, whether they are in guest rooms, restaurants, the gym or other public areas.\n\nFull details are being ironed out, but several initiatives in development include:\n\nAn official room seal indicating that a room hasn't been accessed after a deep cleaning\n\nThe removal of pen, paper and guest directories in favor of a digital option (or available on request)\n\nContactless check-in, where guests can complete check-in and check-out processes via a mobile app and receive a digital room key (Hilton Honors members already have access to digital keys)\n\nElectrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light to be used in the sanitization process\n\nMarriott updates cleaning procedures\n\nMarriott said it will use electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants to sanitize throughout its hotels. In addition to guest rooms, the sprayers will be used in lobbies, gyms and other public areas. It said the cleaning agents used would be those recommended by the CDC and Prevention and the WHO to kill all known pathogens.\n\nIn addition, the company is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing room keys and adding hand sanitizer stations and signs in the lobby to remind anyone who enters to keep their distance from others. Marriott is also taking a look at what to do at properties that offer buffet service.\n\nChoice Hotels starts 'Commitment to Clean' program\n\nChoice Hotels, too, announced a new cleaning program, which will focus on furniture arrangement to promote social distancing, stronger cleaning protocols for higher-traffic areas like front desks and personal protective equipment for hotel staff.\n\nThe \"Commitment to Clean\" program will involve the chain working with Ecolab and guidance from the CDC, WHO , U.S. Travel Association and AHLA's Safe Stay Advisory Council.\n\nAirbnb issues cleaning recommendations\n\nAirbnb is establishing a new recommended \"cleaning protocol\" with the goal of reassuring both rental property hosts and their guests.\n\nFor hosts, the guidelines will offer recommendations for personal protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while cleaning. Rentals will be spaced out by 24 hours for hosts who have opted in to the cleaning protocols, and hosts will have the option of an online feature that automatically prevents bookings less than 72 hours apart for an extra measure of safety.\n\nTurnkey introduces coronavirus cleaning tips\n\nThe vacation rental service announced updates to its GuestWorks cleaning system and verification technology to best combat coronavirus. Prior to the pandemic, TurnKey was already using a housekeeping scheduler, keyless locks and in-home tablet, among other amenities, and had eliminated the need for in-person communication.\n\nNow the system will be upgraded with updated checklists to help housekeepers disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles and light switches. In the cleaning system's app, housekeepers will have to confirm and verify through a photo the use of COVID-19-eliminating products.\n\nIt will require a 24-hour period between guest stays in May and June of this year and will extend this if necessary. Housekeepers and home inspections by TurnKey staff are permissible between stays, however.\n\nContributing: Chris Woodyard, Curtis Tate\n\n'Going to war':Hotels become barracks for health care workers during coronavirus pandemic\n\nPay now, book later:Hotels sell credits, offering deep discounts for future stays","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":525,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/4\/30\/21242693\/coroanvirus-patients-covid-19-latino-african-american-race-illinois","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":"['Carlos Ballesteros']","title":"Illinois Latinos surpass African Americans in coronavirus cases","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/1f57Y765G4XSrHMEfLNa5rjZCiQ=\/0x0:4700x2461\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19935402\/ELMILAGRO_042820_10.jpg","body_text":"The Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.\n\nAs of Thursday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 12,276 cases where the patient is white, 11,848 among Latinos, and 11,353 in the black community.\n\nLast week, on April 22, there were about 7,800 patients who were white, 5,800 who identified as Latino and 8,100 who were African American.\n\nThe dramatic rise in cases among Latinos is reflective of better testing capabilities and greater awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, but public health experts are raising concerns about the state\u2019s reach among Latino communities in their efforts to contain the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe trend that we\u2019re seeing is that cases among the Latino community are doubling at a faster rate than everyone else, but the response has been limited in those emerging hotspots,\u201d said Aida Giachello, a medical sociologist at Northwestern University and member of the Illinois Latino Covid-19 Initiative, a community outreach group.\n\n\u201cWe want sufficient attention and resources to tackle the virus in our community. We need better messaging on what to do if you contract the virus and how to protect others, especially in Spanish.\u201d\n\nOf the coronavirus cases where a patient\u2019s race and ethnicity was reported, 31% are white, 29% are black and 30% are Latino, according to the state health department. About a quarter of the state\u2019s nearly 53,000 cases do not list the patient\u2019s race or ethnicity.\n\nBy way of comparison, whites account for 60% of the state\u2019s population, Latinos make up 17%, and African Americans account for 14%.\n\nAbout 2,400 Illinoisans have died from COVID-19, 40% of whom were white, 35% were black and 14% were Latino.\n\nArise Chicago labor organizer Jorge Mujica said another reason behind the rising cases among Latinos is they are at high risk of contracting the virus at their workplaces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the source of the spread of the virus has shifted from people traveling to people working, and we know Latinos and African Americans are more likely to work outside their homes,\u201d he said.\n\nMujica said Latino workers across the state have complained to him about employers not providing proper equipment and work conditions that don\u2019t allow for social distancing.\n\n\u201cLabor laws are violated everyday, this is nothing new, and so we\u2019re seeing the same thing when it comes to the new coronavirus rules and guidelines,\u201d he said.\n\nState figures show many ZIP codes reporting the highest number of coronavirus cases encompass predominantly Latino working-class areas like Little Village and Belmont Cragin in Chicago and suburbs like Cicero.\n\nCarlos Ballesteros is a corps member of Report for America, a not-for-profit journalism program that aims to bolster Sun-Times coverage of Chicago\u2019s South Side and West Side.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":533,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/interviews\/202004301079145703-grayzone-founder-unpacking-lies-that-aim-to-deceive-us-into-war-with-china\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-04-30","author":[],"title":"Grayzone Founder: Unpacking Lies That Aim to Deceive US Into War With China","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107860\/87\/1078608730.jpg","body_text":"The Grayzone, a US-based independent news outlet, recently published a story busting the conspiracy theory of COVID-19 escaping from China\u2019s Wuhan Institute of Virology, adding that it is \"the Trump administration\u2019s Iraqi WMD.\"\n\nApart from digging into stories behind the conspiracy theories, the Grayzone also released many reports related to Northwest China\u2019s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in recent months. For example, it released a report in March that stated \"forced labour\" stories hyped by some Western and US media and US-based nongovernmental organisations are orchestrated by the \u201cUS government, NATO, arms industry to drive Cold War PR blitz\u201d.\n\nTo learn more about The Grayzone and its work, the Global Times reporter Liu Xin(GT) spoke to Max Blumenthal(B), an award-winning journalist and founder of the Grayzone.\n\nGT: Do you think The Grayzone is anti-US, as some people criticized?\n\nB: I'm an American. I live here in Washington, DC. Many of my neighbours, where I live in southeast Washington, DC, agree with my opinions. My neighbours are African-American and have been mostly left out by society. They understand that a country that is spending billions and trillions of dollars on an empire abroad is unable to bring them anything at home. And our readers are mostly American.\n\nWe are supported by the American people and people across the West. We are also supported by the American people in the greatest sense because we're supported by people from Latin America who are victims of the American empire, who have family living in the US. So, I think the most American thing to do is to expose an empire that is not giving back to the people.\n\nWe can see it so clearly in the time of coronavirus when so many people are being betrayed by this government, including American military personnel, like these sailors on Theodore Roosevelt, who have been simply betrayed. We care about them as well. That's really what our interest is in.\n\nThe only way they can hurt us is if they prove that we are printing lies, or if they're willing to debate us and show that our arguments are false. But, they're not able to do that.\n\nGT: Some people claimed The Grayzone has a pro-China attitude, especially on the issues of coronavirus and Xinjiang. Do you agree?\n\nB: The Greyzone does not speak for China any more than we speak for the United States. But we speak for people in the West who are opposed to war, and who are sceptical of the narratives that were being fed.\n\nWe're an independent website. We put a lot of effort into understanding the propaganda and stories that we hear. And, when we hear a story again and again and again, that is leading us to become more hostile towards another country, that's when our alarm bells go off, and we start to investigate.\n\nOne of our contributors, Ajit Singh, is a specialist in anti-China propaganda. He is also studying Chinese society and Chinese politics. He is in school to become an actual China expert. He helped expose stories behind reports on \u201cmillions of Uygurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang\u201d by just simply looking at the sources and going deeper and deeper into the story until he found the original source.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo \/ Ng Han Guan Elderly residents wearing masks against the coronavirus wait outside a bank in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province Thursday, April 16, 2020\n\nOne of the sources about [the claim] was a Chinese dissident organisation and a group of Chinese activists who are opposed to the Chinese Communist Party and who are based here in Washington. They're called Chinese human rights defenders, and they are funded by the NED, the US government's regime change arm. They produced a study that claimed that there were 600,000 and a million Uygurs in \u201cconcentration camps\u201d.\n\nBut the study only interviewed a few Uygurs, and then from those interviews, they calculated the population of the villages from where those Uygurs came from and then extrapolated from the population, the total number. It's a completely phony methodology from a partisan US-backed group.\n\nThe other source was Adrian Zenz, who is also part of a right-wing, US government-backed group called Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.\n\nThis group, as an extremist group, exists to erase socialism from the earth, and they are funded by the US government. They have meetings in the US capitol. They have a memorial here in Washington. Zenz himself is a Christian extremist, and he has said that he is on a mission from God against China. But this is the person who is considered the leading expert on Xinjiang in Washington, and who has been quoted in many respected journals on this story.\n\nAjit Singh, our contributor, looked into Zenz\u2019s source and found that his source was a Uygur separatist publication called Istiqlal TV, which is broadcast out of Turkey and has given voice to many extremists. Basically, they appear to have invented it out of whole cloth.\n\nI want to emphasize; I have not been to Xinjiang. I can't claim for certain what's happening there. I've read many reliable reports that there is an enormous amount of surveillance there. But the point is that we are being fed a story, which is aiming to make the American public believe, China is Nazi Germany, and that will only lead us to war. And, this story appears to be a massive exaggeration. I would like to talk about it to the American public. It's unfortunate that only a Chinese network wants to interview me about it. But that's the kind of situation we're in.\n\nI would definitely like to come as a tourist and be able to see for myself. I would like to visit Wuhan and see everything with an open mind.\n\nBut now I'm stuck at home. I have not had a haircut in a month. Everything is closed, and it's very frightening to me that my government is using this situation to try to push us closer to war with a country that very few Americans understand, and very few Americans have visited.\n\nAll I can do from where I am right now is to expose the American institutions and figures that are deceiving the American public into war with, whether it's China, Venezuela, or Iran.\n\nGT: As criticizing China has become politically correct in the US, have you come under some pressure for releasing stories on China?\n\nB: Yes, we face heavy criticism, and we face many insults. People say, \u201cyou are genocide denier\u201d or \u201cyou support other fascist country of China\u201d. People say we support Russia and were paid by Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nWe face a lot of pressure for it. We faced fake lawsuits. I've been arrested and jailed because of the fake allegation made against me by the Venezuelan opposition here in Washington. Our writers are constantly insulted on social media. But one thing that people cannot do to us is accuse us of factual inaccuracies or debate us. We've extended the opportunity for some of our critics to debate us, and they usually say no.\n\nThe Greyzone was founded in 2015 to shine a light on the excesses of American foreign policy and how it was affecting us at home. Since then, we have taken on some of the hardest topics to discuss in the US, which I believe are leading the US to war.\n\nWe're simply there to expose the lie of the day. Whenever the public is being lied to and dragged into greater hostility with other nations, they don't understand; we're there to help them unpack the lies. We don't publish editorials. We publish simply reporting and analysis.\n\nAnd we are an independent website. We are completely independently supported. We are not supported by any states or billionaires.

The Indian Navy has announced its operational preparedness, but there are severe costs for the anti-China maritime posture in the region.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of National Defence (MND) announced the deployment of the 690 naval personnel-strong 35th Task Force of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday in order to carry out anti-piracy patrols in the Indian Ocean, which is considered India\u2019s geopolitical sphere of influence.\n\nThe PLAN's guided missile destroyer the Taiyan and the frigate Jingzhou will for the first time ever protect \"ships and vessels\u201d passing through the region.\n\nThe task force, comprising at least two dozen naval helicopters and replenishment oiler the Chaohu, will also support vessels off the coast of Somalia, where the PLAN has been carrying out naval escort missions since December 2008.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when the International Maritime Bureau\u2019s latest global piracy report shows zero hijackings in the last two quarters and no incidents around Somalia. Global shipping data also suggest a massive decline in the number of ships calling on ports, including in Europe and China.\n\nExplaining the purpose of such a deployment at this time, Captain D.K. Sharma, who retired from the Indian Navy in September 2019 after serving as the spokesperson for 10 years, tells Sputnik: \u201cThe foothold which the PLA Navy established in 2008 in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), in the garb of anti-piracy missions, won't be diluted at any cost\u201d.\n\nThe captain brings up Beijing\u2019s strategy \u2013 termed the \"String of Pearls\" by the US consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton in its 2005 report \u201cEnergy Futures in Asia\u201d \u2013 to expand its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) by building maritime civilian infrastructure in friendly countries.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2020 \/ HO \/ Iranian Army office A photo shows a view of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force Type 052D destroyer Xining (117), the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy frigate \"ALBORZ\" (72), and the Russian Navy Neustrashimyy-class frigate \"Yaroslav Mudry\" (777) during joint Iran-Russia-China naval drills in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman\n\n\u201cIt (String of Pearls) was a well thought-out strategy. Also, they (Beijing) have interests in the Indian Ocean Region with Djibouti, Gwadar, Myanmar Bangladesh etc., as part of their One Belt One Road programme. Anti-piracy patrol is an alibi to cover up their other designs in the overall scheme of things\u201d, the captain says.\n\nEver since the 2005 report, many strategic analysts have also termed it as a strategy to encircle India, which has a dominant position in the Indian Ocean Region. However, China has denied any such strategy.\n\n\u201cHappy Hunting\u201d Has Its Cost\n\nThe Indian Navy has clearly indicated that it will not lose its stance in the Indian Ocean Region, despite the battle against COVID-19.\n\nStating the impact of China in the Indian Ocean Region, former Indian Navy spokesperson Sharma says: \u201cPresence of Chinese PLA Navy ships in Indian Ocean Region [does] make a difference to [the] Indian Navy as they have to keep a constant eye on their movements. These ships are involved in many other activities apart from normal patrols in Gulf of Aden\u201d.\n\nFor the second time in a month, when it is assisting civilian authorities in the fight against COVID-19, the Indian Navy released a statement on 18 April stating: \u201cOur assets continue to remain on patrol covering a vast oceanic swath from the Straits of Malacca in the East to Bab-el-Mandeb in the West, including undertaking Operation Sankalp to provide reassurance and protection to our merchant vessels and anti-piracy patrols in Gulf of Aden\u201d.\n\nSharma also states that this will only add a financial burden on the Indian Navy, which has also increased its strategic co-operation of-late to counter China.\n\nApart from incurring huge costs on operating around 50 combat-ready warships \u2014 destroyers, frigates, corvettes, large patrol vessels \u2014 and daily sorties by Poseidon P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, which are now permanently positioned in the Indian Ocean Region, the \u201cmission-based deployment\u201d also wears out the Indian Navy\u2019s combat assets and trained personnel.\n\n#MissionBasedDeployments From Persian Gulf to Malacca Straits & from Northern Bay of Bengal to Southern Indian Ocean to East coast of Africa @indiannavy with 50 ships on vigil 24X7 keep our Area of Responsibility (AOR) safe. @indiannavy Anytime, Anywhere Everytime @nsitharaman pic.twitter.com\/rxmBAed5Sa \u2014 SpokespersonNavy (@indiannavy) April 17, 2018\n\nIndian Navy commanders have raised concerns over critical capability gaps in ship-borne helicopters, fleet support ships, and submarines. This means that continuous deployment of these assets raises the possibility of accidents and encounters at sea.\n\nThese concerns compound the already existing financial crisis caused by COVID-19, as a top official of India's Defence Ministry told Sputnik that the defence budget is being reduced by 20-30 percent this year.\n\nFor 2020, the Navy received around $3 billion for revenue expenditures and around $3.8 billion for capital expenditures, which is $3 billion lower than the projected expenditure this year. The Navy had already pulled back its requirement of Mine Counter Measure Vessels, helicopters, and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nNaval Deployments for All\n\nThe two Asian giants have emphasised time and again that their naval deployments are not only for their own purposes, but they can provide assistance to their friendly neighbours as well.\n\nAs China despatched its naval combat force \u2014 the first time in four years \u2014 consisting of around a dozen warships, India called off any strong action against the then Abdulla Yameen government, which was considered pro-China.\n\nPast incidents suggest that such deployments come in handy in times of crisis to governments having close relations with Beijing. This was evident in 2018, when the Abdulla Yameen government announced a state of emergency in the Maldives and India had to rush its aircraft and ships to its southern bases.\n\nHowever, India has been moving forward to establish a new base on Assumptions Island in the Seychelles and negotiated military access to naval facilities at ports in Oman and Indonesia last year.\n\nCOVID-19 Challenges to Navy\n\nIndian Navy Chief Karambir Singh told commanders in a video message on 7 March that \u201cit can no longer be business as usual\u201d.\n\nHence, the Chinese deployment in a time of crisis poses a big challenge for the Indian Navy, whose warships are teeming with men more than other navies \u2014 as evident during the multilateral exercise \u2014 to operate in full capability while maintaining physical distancing to remain COVID-19-free.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":553,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/1\/21244216\/madonna-tests-positive-covid-19-antibodies-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-01","author":[],"title":"Madonna tests positive for COVID-19 antibodies","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/IHCJNIJkCqVL4PKqsKchMdO9J9I=\/0x125:5568x3040\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19937877\/GettyImages_605870012.jpg","body_text":"Madonna revealed that she has tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.\n\n\u201cTook a test the other day.

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA week ago, President Trump, Democratic leaders in Congress, and the National Governors Association's bipartisan leaders all expressed support for Washington providing fiscal relief for cash-strapped states in the next stimulus measure.\n\nThey recognized that, due to what's becoming the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, states are facing budget shortfalls of unprecedented size and \u2014 without relief \u2014 they'll start laying off first responders, teachers, and health care workers and cutting spending in other ways that will deepen the recession.\n\nNow, however, Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and other Senate Republicans are suggesting that the state budget crisis reflects the fiscal irresponsibility of Democrat-run states and arguing that Washington shouldn't bail them out because that would only reward their profligacy.\n\nBut, as John Adams said, facts are stubborn things. And the fact is that states face a budget crisis not because they've mismanaged their finances. It's because all over America, in states led by Republicans as well as Democrats, businesses have closed and millions have lost their jobs, and, as a result, state tax revenues have dried up at a record pace. States get 70% of their tax revenues from sales and income taxes, and both are collapsing because places where people shop are closed and the millions who are now laid off aren't paying income taxes.\n\nTo prevent states from making deep budget cuts and imposing massive layoffs that would make the economic crisis even worse, the federal government must provide significant fiscal relief as soon as possible and ensure that it remains in place until the economy recovers.\n\nStates are facing a massive budget crisis\n\nUnlike the federal government, almost all states must balance their budgets each year. As their current fiscal years draw to a close on June 30, their shrinking revenues are creating huge shortfalls that they must fill this spring as well as projections of more enormous shortfalls for the coming years.\n\nAt the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we project states will have a combined $650 billion in shortfalls from fiscal years 2020 through 2022. Many local governments will face shortfalls on top of that.\n\nWithout significant relief from the federal government, states will have to take drastic action to balance their budgets, such as slashing education and healthcare, laying off teachers and other workers, and canceling contracts with businesses. That would take money out of the economy at just the wrong time, making the recession deeper, delaying the recovery, and hurting millions of families.\n\nStates were in good shape before the pandemic\n\nFar from mismanaging their finances of late, states did a reasonable job in recent years of preparing for a recession, with \"rainy day\" funds of about 7.5% of state budgets, which was higher than before the last recession. Their total reserves, which include the year-end balances in their general funds, were also higher.\n\nAlso in better shape were the state trust funds that support unemployment insurance programs. The problem is that nobody could have predicted that a global pandemic would send the economy into such a steep nosedive and eviscerate state finances so quickly.\n\nStates have hardly been overspending of late. State general fund spending for current operations \u2014 basic functions like schools, healthcare, the justice system, and public health \u2014 is significantly lower as a share of the economy than before the last recession. Frankly, states have spent too little in some key areas, shortchanging investments needed for future economic growth.\n\nFor instance, states have fewer teachers and other school workers than a decade ago, even though they now have many more students. State funding for higher education per pupil is down an average of 13% from about a decade ago in inflation-adjusted terms, forcing colleges to raise tuition and putting college out of reach for more families. And, as a share of the economy, states are spending far less on infrastructure than decades ago, shortchanging another key tool for economic growth.\n\nFunding for critical services\n\nMcConnell's suggestion that states would use fiscal relief to bail out their pension systems is badly off-base. For starters, they would put fiscal relief dollars into their general funds, not the separate trust funds that cover pensions.\n\nWhile states and localities make payments into the pension funds to help cover future obligations, these payments comprise an overage of just 4.7% of state and local general fund spending.\n\nRather than help the states, McConnell has said that Washington should let them go bankrupt. That would do nothing to help the economy now, however, and it would hurt the states in the coming years.\n\nBankruptcy lets individuals and businesses ease their debt and cancel their obligations, but state debt isn't high by historical standards and states should be able to meet those obligations when the economy recovers. Since the late 1800s, only one state (Arkansas in 1934) has ever defaulted on its general obligation debt.\n\nLetting states declare bankruptcy could significantly raise their borrowing costs for major transportation and other projects because investors, who would worry about getting repaid, would demand higher interest payments.\n\nRather than turn an unprecedented state budget crisis into just one more partisan brawl in Washington, the White House and Senate Republican leaders should support the desperately needed fiscal relief that will protect the jobs of many thousands of workers, ease the deep economic downturn, and soften its blow for millions of families.\n\nMichael Leachman is Senior Director of State Fiscal Research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":568,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/wolves\/2020\/5\/2\/21244867\/despite-uncertainty-over-covid-19-chicago-wolves-planning-for-next-season-american-hockey-league","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-02","author":"['Brian Sandalow']","title":"Despite uncertainty over COVID-19, Wolves planning for next season","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/6Rnw49wLjeriYzHXVabT_iMNgf0=\/0x440:6144x3657\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19938969\/49561662426_0ead5a2dc0_6k.jpg","body_text":"Late April and early May is a time when the Wolves and other teams plan for the future. That\u2019s still the case this year, even though the season is technically alive and it\u2019s unclear how the AHL will proceed if it resumes or when the next one will begin.\n\nJon Sata, the Wolves\u2019 senior vice president of partnerships and business development said the franchise would be ready if this season restarted, but \u201cmost everything is pointed toward a start next season.\u201d There are already some provisional dates for the next campaign, and as of Wednesday, the league\u2019s plan was that 2020-21 would be business as usual in the fall until it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cOur first wave of planning has an early October start for games and that we\u2019ll play a traditional season,\u201d Sata said. \u201cThe Plan B looks like a delayed start to the season and the potential of a truncated season thereafter. I think the way that we\u2019re approaching it is planning for the full schedule, and then if we have to pare it down, we\u2019ll adjust -accordingly.\u201d\n\nSata said the Wolves would work with Allstate Arena on scheduling because, like other venues, arena management will try to rebook the events lost during the spring, summer and potentially the fall. That means the building could have a very busy slate even before the Wolves\u2019 home schedule is plotted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big puzzle that we\u2019re doing our best to stay on top of,\u201d Sata said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have it put together when we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nWhen that happens is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nOn April 24, AHL president and CEO David Andrews said on SiriusXM that the league is beginning to pivot toward the 2020-21 season. Playing games without fans, Andrews said, would be very unlikely because the AHL is a gate-driven league.\n\nAndrews said the AHL is building for an October start next season and needs to be ready for that possibility. But it also must look for operating models beginning in November, December and January.\n\nPresumably, one part of the equation for teams is adjusting for an economy that will look much different than it did March 8, when the Wolves last hosted a game. Sata, however, sounded confident that wouldn\u2019t affect the Wolves as much because of their ticket prices.\n\n\u201cIf the economy is challenged when this starts again, which it likely will be, I think we\u2019re in a favorable spot,\u201d Sata said.\n\nSata said a larger worry is people\u2019s comfort in a public setting. The Wolves will follow all public guidelines. The Village of Rosemont, which owns and operates Allstate Arena, will be committed to following those rules and making sure that the building is safe, with precautions such as touch-free sinks, soap dispensers and overly aggressive sterilization and cleaning measures.\n\nBut in general, Sata is trying to keep things in perspective and find some positives. The stoppage and the complications it has caused are a hassle for the sports world, but compared to what other people are dealing with, these are \u201cfirst-world problems\u201d for the Wolves.\n\nThe time has allowed the Wolves to catch their breath, evaluate the business and maybe come out a better organization.\n\n\u201cThis is tough, this is challenging, but some of the best outcomes come from adverse situations,\u201d Sata said. \u201cWe need to push through that and maintain positivity and find some positivity in this.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":573,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/3\/21246071\/lesley-stahl-covid-19-recuperating-hospitalized-health-coronavirus-60-minutes","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-03","author":[],"title":"Lesley Stahl feeling better after battling COVID-19, spending week in hospital","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/8CjZfDHgVG3I38gXB0_4yzWvIzY=\/0x209:2223x1373\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19940763\/GettyImages_1180266117.jpg","body_text":"NEW YORK \u2014 CBS News \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said Sunday that she\u2019s finally feeling well after a battle with COVID-19 that left her hospitalized for a week.\n\nStahl said she was \u201creally scared\u201d after fighting pneumonia caused by the coronavirus for two weeks at home before going to the hospital.\n\n\u201cOne of the rules of journalism is \u2018don\u2019t become part of the story,\u2019\u201d Stahl said at the end of Sunday\u2019s broadcast. \u201cBut instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more-than-one-million Americans who did become part of it.\u201d\n\nStahl, 78, is the dean of correspondents at television\u2019s best-known newsmagazine.

A scary government projection calls for a skyrocketing of new cases by the end of the month. The coronavirus wallops some young people too. Dictators should be tough on the pandemic, but they're botching it. An overlooked detail in a Supreme Court ruling should worry Republicans. The \"murder hornet\"?! Biden shouldn't release his Senate archives unless Trump releases his tax returns. Mr. Buffett waves the white flag on airlines. The Big 3...\n\n3 possible futures for the pandemic\n\nAs the US starts to reopen, researchers have published estimates for the shape of the pandemic. They forecast that the pandemic will last 18 to 24 months, and they describe three scenarios:\n\n1. \"Peaks and valleys.\" In this scenario, the current wave \u2014 the second and highest wave on the chart below \u2014will recede over the summer and then be followed by additional waves of similar magnitude for one to two years. The severity will vary by region and country. Different cities and countries may reimplement restrictions and mitigation measures.\n\nMoore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm\n\n2. \"Fall peak.\" The current wave would recede over the summer, as in the first scenario. But then we would be hit with a far more severe wave this fall. This is what happened in the 1918-19 \"Great Influenza\" pandemic, as well as less devastating flu pandemics in 1957-58 and 2009-10.\n\nMoore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm\n\n3. \"Slow burn.\" The most encouraging scenario. The current wave is by far the worst. And then the pandemic smolders for an additional few years while life goes on.\n\nMoore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm\n\nNote that none of these scenarios involves the coronavirus just disappearing after this first big wave recedes.\n\nThe researchers do not address the possibility that scientists will develop a powerful drug in the next few months that can \"cure\" the disease or a vaccine that will prevent it. They note that vaccines have not played a role in prior flu pandemics.\n\nSharon Begley of STAT News describes each of these scenarios in detail here. \u2014HB\n\nMeanwhile, a government document projects that the US \"daily case\" and \"daily death\" rates will skyrocket later this month\n\nThe New York Times got its hands on a document described as a \"situation update\" from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe document appears to have been updated through May 1. It includes projections for a radical increase in expected \"new cases per day\" and \"deaths per day\" in the second half of this month.\n\nUS Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security, via New York Times\n\nTo emphasize: The top chart calls for the skyrocketing of daily new cases to more than 200,000 by the end of May, up from about 30,000 now.\n\nThe presentation does not explain why the model predicts this acceleration.\n\nAn hour after the document was published, the White House disavowed it. A White House representative told Insider's Eliza Relman that it \"is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting\" and that \"this data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed.\"\n\nSo now we need to understand where those projections came from and whether any government experts believe they are realistic.\n\nHere are the historical numbers in the presentation, which have plateaued at about 30,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths per day:\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security, via New York Times\n\nYes, the coronavirus is roughest on old and sick people, but it's awful for some younger people too\n\nInsider's Aria Bendix, a healthy reporter in her 20s, developed nasty COVID-19 symptoms in late March, which she described here. Nearly 50 days later, she's still not back to full strength.\n\nAria's not alone. Here, she interviews four other otherwise healthy people in their 20s and 30s who have been sick for more than a month.\n\nMeanwhile, Insider's Lydia Ramsey describes how doctors in New York City continue to be surprised and alarmed by the number of younger people who are getting COVID-19, as well as how serious it is for some of them.\n\nIn New York, 18- to 44-year-olds make up about 10% of total cases. More than 4,300 of them have been hospitalized. Nearly 300 of them have died. \u2014HB\n\nWill summer help?\n\nThere is still hope that warmer temperatures will halt or at least slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThe researchers in the study and the article referenced above conclude that summer will reduce the transmissibility of the virus by about 20% \u2014 enough to slow it down, but not enough to eliminate it. \u2014HB\n\nDictators should be great during a pandemic. Why are they botching it?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin listens to Denis Protsenko, chief physician of a hospital for COVID-19 patients on the outskirts of Moscow on March 24. Sputnik\/Alexey Druzhinin\/Kremlin\/Reuters\n\nRussia's COVID-19 outbreak is blazing, with record cases reported on Sunday. Wouldn't you think Vladimir Putin would be handling it better?\n\nAuthoritarians love nothing more than ordering the government to do whatever they want, imposing tight controls on the population, and wantonly enacting emergency restrictions, so you'd expect Putin and his fellow authoritarians to shine during the pandemic. But it's not working out that way.\n\nAcross the world, dictators, as well as democratically elected leaders with authoritarian tendencies, are doing poorly. Putin seems bored by the crisis. Iran continues to be a wreck. The dictator of Belarus, denying that the coronavirus is a threat, has ordered life to continue as usual, leading to one of the world's fastest-rising infection rates. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's he-man approach\u2014 combining skepticism of science with macho recklessness \u2014 has made a mess of Brazil's response.\n\nThis isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Plenty of vibrant democracies \u2014 Spain, Italy \u2014 have struggled with outbreaks, and China almost certainly extinguished its outbreak more rapidly thanks to its totalitarian tools. But in general, controlling the virus seems easier when there's public trust in government, reliable and transparent data, and visible popular support for action \u2014 all of which are hard for authoritarians to muster. Also authoritarians tend to prefer problems they can solve quickly with force or rhetoric, neither of which works on the coronavirus.\n\nOh, and it doesn't help to build trust in public health when any health professional who casts doubt on the government's response falls out a window the next day, as seems to happen in Russia. \u2014DP\n\nVote-by-mail data that could worry Republicans\n\nVoters wearing masks line up at Riverside High School in Milwaukee for Wisconsin's primary election on April 7. Morry Gash\/AP Images\n\nThe savage battle over voting by mail in the 2020 election could be shaped by some unexpected news out of Wisconsin. Last month, as Wisconsin held in-person voting during the pandemic, the US Supreme Court refused to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots. The ruling was seen as a big win for Republicans.\n\nLess noticed was that the court did allow Wisconsin to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day. Under previous rules, Wisconsin accepted only ballots that arrived by Election Day. The Washington Post found that in Wisconsin's two biggest cities, 10% of all ballots were postmarked before Election Day and arrived after Election Day. In other words, 10% of voters in those cities wouldn't have even been counted in previous years.\n\nThe Wisconsin vote could be anomalous: Wisconsin officials and voters had only a few days to prepare and no precedent for pandemic voting. The rest of the country will have months to set rules for pandemic-afflicted balloting.\n\nStill the Wisconsin mail-in data may alarm Republicans, who generally benefit from fewer people voting. Expect them to seek to limit the SCOTUS ruling and to persuade state legislatures to find other ways to restrict voting by mail. Seven states, all Republican-controlled, have already limited balloting by mail to elderly voters. \u2014DP\n\nWhat will restaurants and offices look like post-pandemic?\n\nCheck out this Insider photo essay about restaurants in China after COVID-19: taped-off seats, hand sanitizer on tap, temperature checks at the door. (Meanwhile, in a sign of how hard the virus is to control, the city of Harbin has just closed \"dine-in\" restaurants after an outbreak.)\n\nAnd The New York Times speculates how the pandemic will transform open-plan offices into places with sneeze guards, push-down air vents, and way more space between coworkers.

One or two of these boxes, the theory goes, might contain references to Tara Reade, the former staffer who recently accused Biden of sexually assaulting her.\n\nBiden denied the allegations in an interview on Friday and said that the Delaware boxes didn't contain any materials related to Reade.\n\nReade has said that the boxes aren't likely to contain any references to a sexual assault because she didn't tell Biden's team about it.\n\nNaturally, people are still calling on Biden to unseal all those boxes. If he doesn't, the existence of the boxes threatens to become the same sort of \"what's he hiding?\" weapon that was used so effectively against Hillary Clinton in 2016. (\"But her emails\u2026\")\n\nThe desire to search all potential evidence to get to the bottom of the story is understandable. But the request that Biden unseal his boxes when President Donald Trump still has yet to release his tax returns seems an absurd double standard. \u2014HB\n\nWarren Buffett gives up on airlines\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha announced that he had dumped all his airline holdings.

In South Korea a total of 277 patients were reported to have fallen ill for a second time, as with China and Japan.\n\nThe apparent reinfections prompted concerns over the virus mutating at a rate so quickly that people would not be able to build immunity against it. The following genetic analyses of the virus did not yield any substantial changes in the virus that would effectively disguise it from the immune system.\n\nAs a result of these reports W.H.O has warned against using \u201cimmunity passports\u201d as a way of allowing people to return to work simply because they have antibodies for the virus in approaches for countries to begin to lift restrictions and lock downs in a targeted manner to resume economic activity. Such passports would be issued to those who have overcome COVI-19 infections and tested positive for antibodies for the virus based on the assumption of them being immune, but they rely on the accuracy of the testing.\n\nIn an update to this guidance WHO warned that there was \"no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection\". It was also not expected that the PCR testing used to check for blood antigens for the actual particles of the virus itself would have issues.\n\nThe South Korean CDC has found that the PCR test results for the suspected relapsed patients were false positives, warning that the tests were not able to distinguish between live traces of the virus and the harmless dead samples that remain after the patient has recovered.\n\nW.H.O is warning that immunity certification will depend upon the accuracy and reliability of the testing that is being rapidly developed, which under normal circumstances take years of trials to determine.\n\n\"People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,\" the WHO warned. \"The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission,\" its guidance added at the time, although this guidance is currently being kept under review.\n\nUnlike other viruses like HIV and chickenpox that can break into the nucleus of human cells to stay latent for years before reactivating, COVID-19 stays outside of the host\u2019s cell nucleus according to the South Korean CDC.\n\n\"This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence,\" explained Dr Oh Myoung-dong, the head of the CDC committee, meaning it is unlikely for patients to relapse in this fashion.\n\nHowever, if the virus mutates further it could be possible that COVID-19 could infect people who had previously overcome it in the future, in a manner similar to that of the flu.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":593,"url":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/news\/has-new-zealand-effectively-eliminated-covid-19\/","publisher":"WorldHealth.Net","publish_date":"2020-05-04","author":[],"title":"Has New Zealand Effectively Eliminated COVID-19?","image":"https:\/\/www.worldhealth.net\/media\/original_images\/AdobeStock_104809311.jpeg","body_text":"New Zealand has chosen strict lock downs and austerity but what is next, and what have they done to have virtually eliminated this coronavirus outbreak on their island nation, according to the nation\u2019s leader.\n\n\"There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,\" Prime Minister Ardern said. \"But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.\"\n\nThe normally very busy and active island is now basically barren in comparison since the outbreak, deserted highways are just one manifestation of their resolute response to COVID-19; under their stringent lock down orders lights are dark and patios empty at every pub, cafe, and business, while there is yellow police tape sealing off parks and playgrounds with swings and equipment being tied up and out of reach to ward off temptation, as well as trails have barriers with closed signs at their entrances.\n\nThe emptiness across this beautiful island shows that the residents here are following orders and there is not much risk of transgression other than an occasional jogger or a person out for a brief stroll to get some air. Everything is closed except a few paved paths to and from towns to get essential supplies.\n\nClose to 4 million visitors travel to New Zealand to experience its picturesque splendor and wilderness landscape, that is approximately 80% of the resident population, but this outbreak has forced the country to close all of the sought after landscapes and its borders.\n\nIf there is a shiny spot amid the global responses to this outbreak, New Zealand just might be it. While other governments have been more than a little indecisive wavering between different opinions and actions on the best response allowing the ensuing cases of infection to soar, New Zealand has set an uncompromising science driven example.\n\nThe country banned travel from China on February 3rd and since then their trajectory of new cases looked out of control until mid March when their austerity measures seemingly have been able to bring the spread of COVID-19 to heel on the island nation.\n\nOn March 15 the country began mandatory quarantines on all visitors, the strictest policy at the time, and just 10 days later New Zealand instituted a complete countrywide lock down which included a moratorium on the domestic level. The level 4 restrictions meant that hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations and grocery stores were the only commerce allowed to be open, vehicle travel was restricted, and social interaction was limited to within households.\n\nThe Prime Minister of New Zealand made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, and was bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals to help stop any confusion or panic about the sudden austerity, while delivering and supporting the same message. She also announced a few days after the lock down that the country rather than just slowing the transmission of the virus had set a course to eradicate the virus by cutting off the arrival of new cases and choking out any existing ones with these restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe must fight by going hard and going early,\u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement to the nation on March 14. \u201cWe have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus. But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t have superpowers. Once transmission is stopped, it\u2019s gone,\u201d said Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, who suggests that the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other countries. \u201cNew Zealand got everything right,\u201d she said. \u201cDecisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.\u201d\n\nLooking at New Zealand from the outside perspective it is rather different than the indecisiveness, confusion, and whinging being seen in America, in New Zealand the entire country simply got on board with the idea as it was clearly and concisely explained to them. In this country right from day one of their lock down the streets and highways were empty, stores were closed and everyone stayed home rather than complaining like entitled children having a temper tantrum.\n\nSince their measures were put into place, they appear to be working as their daily infection rate in this island nation of 4.9 million people has been decreasing steadily from the maximum of 146 in March to just a few cases by mid April; in all New Zealand has reported a high of 1,476 cases with 19 deaths, and on April 26th, the country experienced no new COVID-19 cases and no community transmission for the first time in 6 weeks, but 7 new cases appeared on April 30, 2020.\n\nEven with the 7 new cases the low numbers gave the government the confidence to ease up on the country\u2019s social distancing restrictions to lower them to Level 3 at the end of April, and Ardern pronounced that the virus had been eliminated, she later clarified that \u201celimination doesn\u2019t mean zero cases... we will have to keep stamping COVID out....\u201d Downgrading to level 3 means that most but not all businesses are being allowed to reopen provided they follow safety measures, but all that require face to face contact must remain closed until level 2 is reached.\n\n\"Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,\" she said. \"Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.\"\n\nEven though New Zealand is sounding fairly confident about eliminating this virus, the success is not guaranteed. For instance other countries such as Singapore that also appeared to have the virus under control have now been struggling with a second wave of infections, and in China which also appeared to stop the spread completely are now contending with a second wave as well.\n\nIf New Zealand has managed to contain this virus outbreak, the country will still face a long and hard road, as once they are virus free they will need to maintain the total halt on all arrivals from outside of the country or risk the chance of reinfection until the entire world has managed to snuff out the virus as well. For a country like New Zealand that is largely reliant on tourism in terms of foreign exchange earnings that accounts for 10% of the GDP and nearly 15% of their workforce that is a tough prospect. For the Kiwi economy this puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and it is forecasted that the country will be among the hardest hit nations, which may not recover until at least 2024.\n\nAustralia has also been experiencing a decline in their new cases since their peak a month ago, according to their home affairs minister Peter Dutton, New Zealand and Australia are at a comparable stage in their fight against COVID-19.\n\nRecent surveys indicate that 87% of the New Zealand population support the way that their government is handling this crisis, and it may have been easier for citizens to fall in to tow the line in this country because in general the vast majority trusts their leaders. In New Zealand it is reported that the streets remain clean and quiet, public services are functioning, stores are well stocked, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 appears to be remote and diminishing with each passing day thanks to clear and concise leadership and the citizens cooperating by following guidelines to do their part in battling the outbreak.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":603,"url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/5\/21248095\/coronavirus-case-deaths-national-data-black-african-american-counties","publisher":"The Verge","publish_date":"2020-05-05","author":"['Justine Calma']","title":"A majority of coronavirus deaths in the US were in disproportionately black counties","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/p6QO7JE2cDB1Jb4W64a9d84xKM4=\/0x146:2040x1214\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19933221\/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.jpg","body_text":"Half of all COVID-19 cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths due to the disease in the US occurred in counties that are disproportionately black, according to newly released data that is still being reviewed by scientists. The numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are also higher in counties with a bigger proportion of black residents, the new analysis shows.\n\nOnly 22 percent of counties in the United States are disproportionately black, but the people within them have endured the majority of deaths in the country. These findings are the most comprehensive evidence we have yet showing how the novel coronavirus is taking a heavier toll on African Americans since national demographic data on race has so far been incomplete. An accurate picture of who is hardest hit is needed so that these disparities don\u2019t play out again when it comes to who can get a vaccine and treatments as these become available, researchers say.\n\n\u201cWe might see history repeat itself\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we might see history repeat itself when a vaccine becomes available,\u201d Gregorio Millett, the study\u2019s lead investigator, said in a press call. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have studies like this and other studies that come out to show where COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are concentrated to make sure that these marginalized populations are among the first to have access.\u201d\n\nThis study was released today on the website of amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research to allow other scientists to comment on it. The results may change before it is finalized and published. The foundation worked in collaboration with Emory University, Johns Hopkins, O\u2019Neill Institute, Georgetown University, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. They analyzed data on the pandemic collected on or before April 13th.\n\nThe racial breakdown of COVID-19 cases has trickled out from states and cities since March. More than 80 percent of coronavirus patients hospitalized in Georgia were black, according to a recent sample taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 305 patients. That\u2019s despite black residents making up less than one-third of the population. But the CDC\u2019s national data is still missing the races of more than 55 percent of COVID-19 cases nationwide.\n\nLawmakers have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to collect racial and ethnic demographics. \u201cLack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,\u201d they wrote in a March 27th letter to the agency. \u201cExisting racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation\u2019s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community.\u201d\n\n\u201cthe nation\u2019s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally\u201d\n\nMore than 90 percent of the disproportionately black counties studied are in the South. But the researchers found that cases and deaths were higher in African American communities, regardless of whether the area was more rural or more urban.\n\nIn New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, there are stark differences in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths by county, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The Bronx has the highest proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and higher death and hospitalization rates than New York City\u2019s other boroughs, which each have their own counties. Manhattan is predominately white, and it has the lowest rates for deaths and hospitalizations.\n\nThe new national study also highlighted that rates of being uninsured, living in crowded households, and being exposed to more air pollution were also higher in counties that were disproportionately black \u2014 all factors associated with making it harder for these communities to stay healthy. These counties were also less likely to social distance compared to other counties, based on location data from cellphones. The study also noted that African Americans are more likely to be essential workers who aren\u2019t able to work from home, despite shelter-in-place orders.\n\nWhile the data is still emerging, it\u2019s not necessarily surprising to public health experts who have worked to end racial disparities in a broad range of health outcomes that are a result of long-standing economic and social barriers. \u201cIt\u2019s the social conditions that we have created,\u201d says, David Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard, told The Verge in April. \u201cI hope this is a wake up call for America.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":626,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/2020\/national\/map-us-still-staying-home-coronavirus\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-06","author":"['Kevin Schaul', 'Brittany Renee Mayes', 'Bonnie Berkowitz']","title":"Where Americans are still staying at home the most","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/resizer\/aFwatuDxXw0XAVZ5OlEFjPwnl0A=\/1200x630\/filters:focal(759x380:1541x771):quality(100)\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost\/GWNWKTN2XZEFBM5VWT3DDU3WSA.png","body_text":"If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still at home, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone.\n\nAfter a peak week of sheltering in place in early April, U.S. residents began to inch out of their homes, according to new cellphone data.

See full methodology at bottom of article.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post analysis of data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information, the peak period of our collective, coronavirus-induced lockdown was the seven-day period ending April 7. (There was also a one-day spike on Easter Sunday.) During that time, U.S. residents spent a whopping 93 percent of their time at home, up from the early March averages of roughly 70 percent.\n\nSome governors began relaxing restrictions meant to curb the spread of covid-19 at the end of April, after they were prodded by President Trump and cautioned by public health officials. But as of April 30, people were still at home an average of 89 percent of the time.\n\nThe numbers vary greatly by geography. People in some counties appear to barely leave their homes, especially in large metro areas, including hard-hit New York, Detroit and Chicago. People in areas that are less populated tend to leave a bit more, and residents in at least one very rural county in Arizona are approaching the amount of free-roaming time they enjoyed in early March.\n\nBeaches and parks, such as this one in Jacksonville Beach, reopened April 17 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with restrictions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in Duval County, Fla.

(This type of tracking, which requires users to allow location data when they use certain apps, has rattled privacy experts. App users are often not aware that their data is being used by third-party companies.)\n\n[It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the middle of the night.

They simply may be enjoying warmer weather outdoors, especially in places such as the Upper Midwest, which had an unseasonable April cold snap.\n\n[Americans widely oppose reopening most businesses, Post-U. Md. poll finds]\n\nPings from phones within businesses and recreational areas show where people are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 showing up. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to parks and grocery stores, according to Google data, which tracks users via their Google Accounts and compares their locations to a baseline from before stay-at-home orders were in place.\n\nPark visits have trended upward recently.\n\nWorkplace visits, however, have not. The percentage of phones (and presumably, their owners) in workplaces dropped steeply in mid-March and has barely risen. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.\n\nSafeGraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more granular data shows people are again hitting general merchandise stores such as Walmart and Target at near-March levels. Some are satisfying fast-food cravings at restaurants with counter service.\n\nThe data lines up with responses in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released May 5 in which more than half of people said they were comfortable visiting grocery stores, but 78 percent said they would not be comfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant, and 67 percent said they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be comfortable shopping in a clothing store. Only 18 percent of respondents were in favor of reopening movie theaters.\n\nState orders don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily dictate behavior\n\nWhile governors have issued guidelines for reopening their states, businesses and customers have been slow to return in many locales.\n\nOne of the earliest states to relax restrictions was Georgia, where a group of southwestern counties are suffering through some of the highest per capita covid-19 death rates in the country. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) allowed spas, hair salons, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen on April 24. As of April 30, it did not appear that most Georgians immediately flocked out to get haircuts and hit weight rooms. On average, they were still staying home 86 percent of the time, compared with 92 percent at their early-April peak.\n\nSome states are starting to leave home more than others\n\nShare of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on each date\n\nNew Jersey South Dakota Select a state: Michigan\n\nIn New Jersey, second only to New York in covid-19 deaths, people are spending 96 percent of their time at home, just 1.7 percent less than at the peak. That is both the highest stay-home percentage and the smallest change of any state. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened state parks and golf courses on May 2, but his stay-at-home order is still in effect.\n\nMontanans, by contrast, are going out 10 percent more compared with the peak, the largest change in any state. The state has reported 456 covid-19 cases and 16 deaths as of May 5. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has allowed retail and churches to reopen and will allow restaurants and schools to open May 7.\n\nAlaskans and South Dakotans are spending the least time at home, 80 percent on average. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem was one of seven governors to never issue a stay-at-home order. The state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country, at a Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls.\n\nVariations on how people move around within states are common and sometimes large, and they often \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not always \u00e2\u0080\u0094 follow the pattern of virus outbreaks.\n\nIn Florida, people in the populous southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where most of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s covid-19 cases have been concentrated and where beaches remain closed, are spending about 4 percent more time away from home than in early April. But people in the adjacent counties of Collier and Monroe, which includes the Florida Keys, were out of their houses 13 percent more as of April 30 than at the peak.\n\n[Where people have died of covid-19 by county]\n\nAreas of Georgia around Atlanta showed almost no decrease, led by Forsyth County, which barely budged from its peak of 97 percent at home. By contrast, people in rural Dooly County in the central part of the state were going out 12 percent more than they had at their stay-home peak, despite having a covid-19 death rate that is 19 times higher than Forsyth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nQaadir Larke, owner of the Quad Barbershop in Atlanta, gives Brandon Lewis a haircut on April 24.

In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the difference is just 4 percent off the peak, and as of April 30, people were still home 90 percent of the time.\n\nIn general, people in rural areas are away more than people in urban and suburban areas, in large part because stores, services and essential workplaces are much farther away and delivery services are rare or nonexistent. But the trend lines are very similar across all types of places.\n\nThe data clearly shows that when Americans were told it was time to stay home, most people did. It also indicates that they are deciding for themselves when to go back out.\n\nAbout this story\n\nData for this story was provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates location data from tens of millions of devices and compares it with building footprints. The Post analyzed its social distancing metrics data set to estimate the share of time spent at home for each county.\n\nThe raw numbers fluctuate from day-to-day and county-to-county, and some counties have far fewer devices than others. To account for these challenges, we adjusted the device counts based on population and performed a multilevel regression using a random effects model on the county, state and national levels. Because people tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, we chose to calculate a seven-day rolling average, which results in each \u00e2\u0080\u009cday\u00e2\u0080\u009d of data including five week and two weekend days.\n\nThis analysis relies on defining a \u00e2\u0080\u009chome\u00e2\u0080\u009d location for every device. SafeGraph does this by finding the usual nighttime location of each device over the course of six weeks. It then buckets that location into a grid of roughly 150-meter-wide boxes across the country. When the device remains in that box, it is considered as being home. Of course this is not perfect, but in aggregate and at scale, SafeGraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at-home numbers track with other data sources, including location-data research published by other companies and public polling.\n\nUrbanization figures are based on county designations from the National Center for Health Statistics\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urban-rural classification scheme.\n\nLenny Bronner and Leslie Shapiro contributed to this report.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":631,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/interviews\/202005061079216950-amazon-should-be-nationalised-as-it-has-become-a-public-marketplace-economist-says\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-06","author":[],"title":"Amazon Should Be Nationalised as It Has Become a Public Marketplace, Economist Says","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107908\/17\/1079081790.jpg","body_text":"Amid an increase in demand for online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon reported earlier that its sales jumped 27 percent to $75.5bn in March compared with last year and the company projects that its income will increase to $81bn.\n\nSputnik spoke about Amazon's success with Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of Economics at Boston University.\n\nSputnik: According to reports, Jeff Bezos is set to be the world's first trillionaire. In your view, what are the main reasons that Amazon has been able to maintain its position on the market amid the pandemic?\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff: The worry that people have about in-store shopping is the main reason. So it's very good news for Amazon, but really terrible days for retail outlets.\n\nThey are blocked in Boston and in Moscow, you're gonna find everything shut down. It's a ghost town. And every city in the US, with some exceptions in states that have decided to ignore the danger or the risk, they may find that they made a big mistake.\n\nThere are some countries that are able to continue maintaining retail outlets as they did before. But for the most part, we've got France, Italy, US, UK shut down. So the only way it can get the products is... over the internet from Amazon because I couldn't go down and try it out in IKEA as the store's been closed.\n\nI do think that there's a question here whether these companies like Amazon need to be nationalised, to tell you the truth because it's a public marketplace.\n\nThe marketplace needs to be organised by governments. Some shops are not operating in a lot of countries on Sunday or Saturday, the weekends, because it's a day of rest for the workers. You don't want to have some people go to some stores if they are closed on Saturday and others are open.\n\nIt doesn't make sense. You want to coordinate. So if I go to the butcher shop, I can also walk across the street, go to the shoe store on the same day at the same hour. Otherwise, you don't get the same level of economic activity. So I think Amazon needs to be nationalised. And also the concentration of wealth going to one person or a set of people is not healthy for any country.\n\nSputnik: But what is the key element of Amazon\u2019s success in comparison to any other company in this field?\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff: What is their big advantage? They got in first. What is the big advantage of Facebook? They got in there first. It was random.\n\nWhat about, a lot of companies that have been successful. We're just like a step ahead of the competition. But it's like a market where only one player can play. It makes sense to have one place as people don't want to go online to 20 different websites to see if they can find out what they can buy.\n\nSputnik: What impact can Amazon's success have on other competing firms on the US market?\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff: Well, they can do what it has been doing. Same with realy big stores like Walmart. You can put small retailers out of business. Such stores as Walmart, Costco and IKEA are big box stores that are exploiting their natural monopolies.\n\nSo if you have a lot of small stores in a nice little town in the countryside and then maybe a Walmart... all the small stores in this little town suffer dramatically, and then the town is basically boarded up.\n\nWe have to think about, what kind of a society we want to have? People just buying from one company on the internet, buying from a couple of huge stores and having no community life, no towns, everybody just living inside their apartments or homes?\n\nIs that the vision of our national urban planning that we're striving for or are we trying to maintain our way of life? Think about Europe. If you are in France or England, there are a few box stores, but they're pretty remote compared to what we have in the US.\n\nIt's a public good for everybody. Everybody can go out to the countryside and enjoy it. But then they (box stores) arrived in the Cotswolds, in the U.K. or the countryside of France.\n\nIn the US, you have to drive from the East Coast about a third way across the country to have that experience. I mean, there are places you can go in remote parts of New York state. We have a sprawling suburban system here.\n\nWe have decided that anybody can put up any kind of house, any kind of business on any road in any part of the country.\n\nSputnik: In your view, what can be done by the government and local authorities to help other companies keep afloat during this crisis?\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff: During this crisis, we need to explain something to you that is a little different from the standard answer you might be expecting, which is we need to find a way to capture or kill this virus. And there is a method for doing that, which is very straightforward. Suppose you had the ability to give everybody a test every single day so if they were negative, you could give them a rating bracelet to wear during the day, and they could go back to work, school, go to movies, shop. And if they were red, if they were testing positive, they'd have to stay inside until they tested green again and then they could go out.\n\nThat would immediately mean that everybody on the outside would be safe to interact with. Everybody on the inside would be trying to survive this thing, getting health care and free fruit right now. That's an example of containing and killing the virus. Within a few weeks, we would have no virus problem.\n\nIt would have been killed off. The people with the virus would have either survived or passed away, unfortunately. And the people outside would be virus-free. Now, there are issues of false negatives in the testing, but this protocol would work even under those conditions because you have it retesting people every day, so you'll catch the false negatives, any kinds of mistakes. Statistically, the transmission rate will go to zero very, very quickly. We do not have the ability to test everybody every day. That's 7.6 billion tests a day around the world. But we have something that's almost as effective, basic as effective, which is called group testing, where you take 60 households and you pull together, you have them spit into the same cup - that's a household sample.\n\nAnd then you add a reagent to that and then you take each cup, each household sample from 60 different households and you mix all that together. And now you have one batch sample, one called a sample, one group sample and you test that.\n\nAnd if it's negative now, you can give a green bracelet to probably another 50 people in that household.\n\nYou've used one test to clear one hundred and fifty people. That's an enormous deficiency. A hundred and fifty to one efficiency. So we could do a group household testing in our country with six million tests, which we can get to within a couple weeks.\n\nWe could solve this problem in a month if we use them with intelligence and organized, and make it voluntary. So this is really not that hard.\n\nClearly, there's other ways to try and fight this: social distancing and masking... but we're not compliant.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":660,"url":"https:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/2020\/05\/07\/suspicions-raised-over-covid-19-tests-after-a-fruit-reportedly-tests-positive-for-virus\/","publisher":"Waking Times","publish_date":"2020-05-07","author":"['Matt Agorist']","title":"Suspicions Raised Over COVID-19 Tests After a Fruit Reportedly Tests Positive for Virus","image":"https:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/covid-tests-660x330-1.jpg","body_text":"Sen.

It does not mean that the pandemic has been defeated: a new \u201chot spot\u201d is beginning to emerge more and more clearly on the continent. Unfortunately, it goes about Russia.\n\n177 160 confirmed cases of COVID-2019 infection\n\nOf these, 11,231 were detected in the last 24 hours.\n\nMore than half of those infected are still in Moscow.\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says:\n\n\"The fact that we have identified so many infected people is a huge plus, but not a minus, because it means that infected people are quarantined in a timely manner, and the spread of the virus is slowing down.\"\n\nAnother \u201cplus\u201d in comparison with other countries is the relatively low mortality rate among coronavirus patients:\n\n1,625 people have died in the country during the epidemic (as of May 8, 2020)\n\nAccording to the authorities, the outbreak of the epidemic in Russia started later than in many other countries, and Russia had time to get prepared for the challenge.\n\nOn May 7, Russia was ranked fifth in the world in the number of COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, the Russian authorities decided to gradually lift quarantine restrictions. For example, courts will resume their work from May 12. Industrial and construction companies will start operating in Moscow too. However, the quarantine restrictions will not touch upon citizens and small businesses. On the contrary, the measures will be toughened, and the Russians will have to pay for those restrictions from their own pockets.\n\nFrom May 12, Moscow is introducing the mask regime in the city. One will be required to wear a face mask or a respirator to be able to use the metro or public transport. In addition, one will have to wear gloves. To comply with these requirements, every Muscovite will have to spend at least 2,000 rubles a month.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":716,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/city-hall\/2020\/5\/8\/21252337\/chicago-mayor-lightfoot-raise-taxes-revenue-coronavirus-losses","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-08","author":"['Fran Spielman']","title":"Lightfoot eyeing \u2018range of revenue-generating options\u2019 to recover money lost to coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/z1-k0WFfV0MRb1UYMrzvsOz-iL0=\/0x103:5362x2910\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19300042\/FRANSHOW_101919_01.jpg","body_text":"Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday she\u2019s looking at a \u201crange of potential revenue-generating options\u201d to cover declining revenues and rising costs tied to the coronavirus.\n\nLast month, Lightfoot vowed to be \u201cstraightforward and very transparent\u201d with Chicagoans if and when she concluded tax increases were needed to plug the giant hole in her 2020 budget caused by the stay-at-home shutdown of the city\u2019s economy.\n\nOn Friday, the tough talk began.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a range of potential revenue-generating options. Look, the reality is, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any city budget across the country that is not gonna have to look at one-time measures to put yourself back on track,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to avoid those in this administration. But, the truth is, we\u2019re probably gonna have to look at those as well given the magnitude of the challenge that we\u2019re facing \u2014 not only to make sure that we\u2019re steady for 2020 but looking to 2021 and beyond.\u201d\n\nLightfoot said increasing property taxes is \u201calways the last choice,\u201d even though it is the most reliable source of revenue. But it is \u201cparticularly the last choice in this environment, when people are really, really suffering\u201d and unemployment has risen to levels not seen since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cThe number of landlords that are worried about foreclosure. The number of renters that are worried about being able to make the rent. If we raise property taxes, that has a cascading effect on the ecosystem \u2014 on landlords and renters at a time when neither can afford it,\u201d she said.\n\nWith property taxes off the table, where will Lightfoot turn for revenue?\n\nShe would only say, \u201cThe reality is that, when you have to have revenue, it\u2019s going to impact someone \u2014 and probably someones plural. But we\u2019re looking at efficiencies that we save internally first. I still believe that you can\u2019t go out and talk to the taxpayers about sacrifice if you\u2019re not making commonsense sacrifices within city government.\u201d\n\nFor weeks after the stay-at-home shutdown, Lightfoot said Chicago was well-positioned to weather the storm of increased costs and declining revenues tied to the coronavirus pandemic without blowing a giant hole in her precariously balanced budget.\n\nShe repeatedly said \u201cno one revenue stream is more than 13%\u201d and that all of the \u201ceconomically sensitive\u201d revenues together total just 25%.\n\nHer claims about city finances ignored the fact that when the stock market drops and city pension funds don\u2019t meet their expected investment returns, Chicago taxpayers make up the difference.\n\nThe mayor even ridiculed former mayoral challenger Paul Vallas for writing an opinion column claiming Chicago was \u201cfacing a code-red fiscal crisis\u201d and Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cclaim that Chicago\u2019s budget is in good shape strains credulity.\u201d\n\nIn a stinging public put-down, Lightfoot referred to Vallas as \u201cdesperate to be relevant\u201d during the crisis and said he \u201cprobably hasn\u2019t touched a city budget, doesn\u2019t know the nuances, in probably two decades.\u201d\n\nVallas served as city revenue director, budget director and Chicago Public Schools CEO under former Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nOn April 7, the mayor changed her tune and acknowledged the possibility of a midyear budget fix.\n\nOn Friday, she again refused to project the size of Chicago\u2019s budget shortfall, saying the situation was still \u201cunbelievably fluid\u201d and an initial estimate would end up too low and need to be revised upward at a time when laid-off Chicagoans are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table.\n\n\u201cA lot of it depends on when we reopen, who reopens, what the revenue stream is from the businesses that do reopen. This is not simple math. It\u2019s very, very complicated and it\u2019s fluid. We want to put something out that we can stand behind,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a cautious person. I want to make sure we understand the full magnitude of the challenge. Has there been an impact? Of course there has been. Has it been significant? Yes. What that looks like precisely, we still need to look at some other data that just hasn\u2019t come in yet.\u201d\n\nLightfoot said a \u201cbig, important, determining factor\u201d in the need to raise local taxes will be what, if any, revenue replacement relief comes from Congress in the next round of stimulus money.\n\nShe noted the Federal Reserve has also \u201copened up potential borrowing for municipalities\u201d like Chicago, and she is \u201cstill working with them to understand what that possibility would look like\u201d while maintaining dialogue with Wall Street ratings agencies.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":735,"url":"https:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/comic-relief-what-its-believe-everything-media-tells-you-about-covid","publisher":"GreenMedInfo","publish_date":"2020-05-10","author":[],"title":"Comic Relief: What It's Like to Believe Everything the Media Tells You About COVID","image":"https:\/\/cdn.greenmedinfo.com\/sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/ogimage\/blog\/maxresdefault.jpg","body_text":"Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020\n\nIn this brilliant comedic transformation of a truly harrowing and tragic situation, JP Sears creates a little light and levity out of the media-fueled COVID lockdown.

There\u2019s no timetable for when the season might begin.\n\nSixty people tested positive in the raw data, and adjustments were made for false positives and false negatives.

The study was not representative of the overall population, given 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities.\n\nMLB team doctors looked at results last month. The goal of the study was to better determine how widespread COVID-19 is, which could aid governments and health professionals in their evaluation of when to lift stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said.\n\n\u201cThe MLB population is a special population. They\u2019re not representative of every city that they\u2019re in,\u201d Bhattacharya said. \u201cThey also are more well to do than a typical population, so it\u2019s not representative. ...

But it's worked \u2014 after hitting one of the highest death rates in the world, the nation's infection rate and death toll have dropped steadily since a peak in early April.\n\nThe decline led Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s to announce this past week that along with letting all stores reopen on May 11, certain social distancing guidelines will be relaxed.\n\nBeginning on Sunday for Mother's Day, Wilm\u00e8s said, each household will be allowed to host up to four other people, preferably all within the same family, as long as social distancing is maintained. These groups cannot have contact with anyone else. Authorities describe it as kind of a \"contract\" between two households that will serve to limit any potential spread of COVID-19.\n\nOf course, choosing can be a delicate process; no one wants to hurt the feelings of a friend or relative if they don't make the cut.\n\nSeventeen-year-old music student Carla Vandersteen says her friends started texting immediately about getting together. She's made her \"list,\" consisting of the three friends who live closest to her, but still thinks it's smartest not to go out.\n\n\"At least [to protect] your parents!\" she urges. She says it would be so hard to see her best friends and not hug them. She fears many young people will now act like restrictions are completely lifted.\n\nMany Belgians have expressed confusion about whether there's any flexibility in the new rules.\n\nAs the parents of three young children, Daniel and Marie Bach joke that as a family of five, they're mathematically ruled out of being any other household's significant others.\n\n\"I think they mean 'more or less four,'\" Marie suggests with a laugh. \"You can't just abandon your last child \u2014 it can't be so.\"\n\nWhile they are looking forward to some company, Daniel acknowledges \"it's a gamble\" for authorities to allow social bubbles to expand. \"A pretty big one, really.\"\n\nThen there's the dilemma of Mother's Day: visit with mom on Sunday and have her locked in as one of your \"four,\" or save that spot for someone else?\n\nVeronique Petit says she and her husband will do some creative counting so that their two adult children can visit them and they can still visit their parents.\n\n\"It's impossible\" to follow these rules, Petit says in exasperation. \"So we're going to cheat a little. I think all Belgians are going to cheat.\"\n\nPolice have admitted they won't be able to verify whether visitations are being carried out correctly, but authorities say if infections spike, restrictions will have to be tightened again.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":751,"url":"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/bank-of-america-coronavirus-bond-corporate-raises-billion-fight-pandemic-2020-5-1029207438","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-10","author":"['Finanzen.Net Gmbh']","title":"Bank of America raises $1 billion in a corporate bond offering to help health industry fight pandemic","image":"https:\/\/images.markets.businessinsider.com\/image\/5e224f7e62fa814a83552a73-2400\/rtr22hzq.jpg","body_text":"REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\n\nBank of America has priced a $1 billion corporate bond issue to help fight COVID-19.\n\nA confidential source told Bloomberg on Thursday that the bank sold fix-to-floating rate notes to fund COVID-19 related social issues.\n\nAnalysts at Moody's Investors Service are bracing for an uptick in sustainable investing this year due to the pandemic.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nBank of America has priced a $1 billion corporate bond issue to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, it is the first sale from a US financial institution that earmarks all funds raised to mitigating the pandemic.\n\nThe bank sold fixed-to-floating rate notes to finance investments that aim to rectify social issues related to coronavirus, a confidential source who was not authorized to speak on the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe source said the bonds will generate a yield 1.30 percentage points higher than US Treasurys.\n\nRead more: Todd Ahlsten has dominated the market and his competitors for 2 decades.

But records show that over the following three weeks, the agency scrambled to turn Trump\u2019s pledge into a reality, spending nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace.\n\nAn analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100,000 new ventilators by around July 13, about a week later than the 100-day deadline Trump first gave on March 27.\n\nBy the end of 2020, the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators, based on the AP\u2019s review of current federal purchasing contracts. That would more than double the estimated 160,000 ventilators hospitals across the U.S. had before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe became the king of ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators,\u201d Trump boasted in an April 29 speech.\n\nBut over the past month, demand for ventilators has decreased even as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 80,000. After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators, many doctors are using them only as a last resort.\n\nThat\u2019s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators, so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations.\n\nIn a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday, the president credited his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators.\n\n\u201cWe built, and we built, and we built,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. It was really \u2014 there\u2019s not been anything like that, since the Second World War, where we did the same thing with other types of product.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adelman, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics, said the U.S. government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs, even under a worst-case scenario forecasting the spread of COVID-19.\n\nBut Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future.\n\n\u201cIt seems incongruent with the forecasts that you\u2019re seeing,\u201d Adelman said of the government purchases. \u201cI\u2019d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few.\u201d\n\nIn patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the virus attacks the lungs, causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli. That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood, which can be deadly. To treat these low oxygen levels, doctors have historically relied on ventilators.\n\nThe Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government\u2019s emergency reserve of medical supplies, had about 16,660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March, with an additional 2,400 out for maintenance.\n\nBy the middle of the month, health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out, potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air.\n\nAmong those calling for additional ventilators was Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use, and patients in need would be left without proper treatment. Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30,000 additional ventilators to get through the mid-April peak of the outbreak. At that point, FEMA had sent New York 400.\n\nTrump expressed skepticism at Cuomo\u2019s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4,000 additional ventilators \u2014 about one-quarter of the nation\u2019s entire emergency stockpile. Still, Cuomo pleaded for more.\n\n\u201cYou pick the 26,000 people who are going to die,\u201d Cuomo said at a news conference,\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just New York, however. Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House.\n\n\u201cThe scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators,\u201d Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing. \u201cI had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nBy late March, a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force U.S. companies to produce ventilators.\n\nTrump had resisted invoking the Korean War-era law, which grants the president sole authority to direct U.S. industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency, saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own.\n\nBut on March 27, Trump changed course, announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators, which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers.\n\n\u201cIn the next 100 days \u2014 well, first of all, we\u2019ve already delivered thousands of them \u2014 but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBy the start of April, FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply. To ration what was left, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a \u201cstrategic national asset\u201d \u2014 to be provided to states only on a case-by-case basis where hospitals could demonstrate an \u201cexigent need\u201d to sustain life within 72 hours.\n\nFederal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic, HHS, which includes the Strategic National Stockpile, had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020.\n\nThat changed within three days of Trump\u2019s March 27 edict, with HSS signing a $350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp. Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks, most of them no-bid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency.\n\nIn a typical year, U.S. companies produce about 29,000 ventilators, according to data cited by the White House. Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production, AP\u2019s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency no-bid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73,990 new ventilators by July 6 \u2014 the 100-day mark since Trump\u2019s March 27 pledge.\n\nIt was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100,000 units by the president\u2019s deadline.\n\nGeneral Motors, which had shut down auto production, had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems, a small ventilator company, to simplify an off-the-shelf design for rapid production at GM\u2019s Kokomo, Indiana, plant.\n\nThough GM had announced it was \u201cworking night and day\u201d to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.\n\n\u201cAs usual with \u2018this\u2019 General Motors, things just never seem to work out,\u201d Trump tweeted on March 27. \u201cGeneral Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!\u201d\n\nGM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019.\n\nThe president also took aim at Ford Motor Co., tweeting that the rival automaker should also \u201cGET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!\u201d\n\nOn April 8, HHS announced it had reached a $489.4 million deal with GM to produce 30,000 ventilators by the end of August, with the first 6,132 delivered by June 1.\n\nThe following week, HHS announced a $336 million contract with Ford and General Electric, which teamed up to make 50,000 of GE Healthcare\u2019s ventilators by July 13.\n\nAssuming all the companies meet their deadlines, AP\u2019s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100,000 new ventilators by mid-July.\n\nHHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request, a legal process that can often take months or even years.\n\nBut AP\u2019s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than $2.9 billion for 198,890 ventilators by the end of 2020, an average per-unit cost of $14,618.\n\nWhether that\u2019s a good deal for U.S. taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don\u2019t publish their prices. HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies, all with different capabilities, features and accessories.\n\nWhen AP sought details from HHS about the per-unit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical, the agency\u2019s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases. An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency\u2019s website.\n\nAP found several instances where the U.S. government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic. For example, contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single, portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for $12,260.\n\nUnder its current contract with Zoll, HHS is purchasing 18,900 of the same model for slightly more than $350 million. That works out to about $18,500 each, which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago.\n\nA HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about $12,100 for each ventilator, and that the additional money was for hoses, face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients. The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port, which cost an additional $722 each, according to HHS.\n\nThe Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories.\n\nZoll\u2019s top executive said his company\u2019s pricing had remained consistent.\n\n\u201cZoll is supplying the U.S. government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing, absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll\u2019s rapid increase in production capacity,\u201d Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday. \u201cWe are focused on fulfilling the government\u2019s order on time and meeting this urgent public need.\u201d\n\nErik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry, said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand. Manufacturers haven\u2019t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines, he said.\n\nU.S. ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5,000 per week by early April, according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale, you get there by brute force, extra labor,\u201d said Gordon, who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas. \u201cYour costs actually go up, not down.\u201d\n\nWith the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the U.S., state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers.\n\nCuomo has compared the free-for-all bidding to going on eBay, and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each.\n\n\u201cWe are paying $25,000 per ventilator, and we are broke,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nMore than a month later, only 2,500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered, according to Cuomo\u2019s office. In a separate case, New York officials are trying to recover another $69.1 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1,450 ventilators that never materialized.\n\nWith nearly 200,000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year, Trump is declaring victory. But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed.\n\nIn the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree, a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived. For patients younger than 70, just 36% lived.\n\nIn New York City, state officials say 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died.\n\nThe studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support.\n\nTrump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall,\u201d Dr. Deborah Birx, a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a briefing on April 21. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy.\u201d\n\nTrump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas, where the needs are greater.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States. Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive U.S. ventilators, along with other countries.\n\n\u201cPeople dying because they don\u2019t have ventilators, and they\u2019re not equipped to do what we did,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cSo we\u2019re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly: Italy, France, Spain, so many countries. And Nigeria called. Tremendous problems in Nigeria. Tremendous problems all over. And so they\u2019re very happy.\u201d\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

After only seven days of being administered the experiments cocktail treatment the patients tested negative for COVID-19 according to the researchers.\n\n\"For the primary endpoint of time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time (7 days) than the control group (12 days),\" the study authors noted. \"For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined. All urine samples tested negative for viral load.\"\n\nPreviously established side effects of the medications were being closely monitored, however the drugs have a long standing track record for safety according to medical officials, and on average patients in the cocktail group felt better after 4 days.\n\n\"Despite the concern of major side effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients,\" the study authors wrote.\n\n\"No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side effects of interferon beta-1b \u2013 despite that at most, three doses were used for each patient,\" they added, noting that \"liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment.\"\n\nThis study was independently reviewed by experts who concurred that these findings were positive, but suggest that larger clinical trials are required for greater certainty of the cocktail\u2019s effectiveness and safety. Other diseases have a record of being treated successfully with a cocktail of drugs, the experts believe that it may also be the case for COVID-19, results are promising and warrant adding interferon beta to the list of evidence based treatments for the coronavirus.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":778,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/entertainment\/celebrities\/2020\/05\/11\/coronavirus-quarantine-diaries-derek-hough-wore-disney-singalong-costume-outside\/3093358001\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-11","author":"['Bryan Alexander']","title":"Quarantine Diaries: Derek Hough's neighbors wonder why he's outside in full Disney costume","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/10\/USAT\/873fe0dd-ab26-4ca1-a7de-7a899fc67ac9-Screen_Shot_2020-05-08_at_3.40.23_PM.png?crop=1197,674,x0,y129&width=1197&height=674&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"Going stir-crazy in quarantine? You\u2019re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.\n\nToday's diarist is \"Dancing With the Stars\" six-time champion Derek Hough, who romped to \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" with girlfriend and fellow quarantiner Hayley Erbert on Sunday's \"The Disney Family Singalong 2.\" (The couple re-created \"Be Our Guest\" for the first singalong last month.) Here's what life is like for multi-threat entertainer Hough, 34, who appears as a judge on NBC's \"World of Dance\" fourth season (returns May 26). \u2013 As told to Bryan Alexander\n\n8 a.m. Sometimes we sleep in, but often we get up about 8 with our cat nuzzling our faces. The bed becomes this animal affair with two cats (Lily and Palo) and dog Romie jumps in at about 7. Most of the time, we don't have breakfast. I drink this green shake in the morning, my favorite thing, with super-green powder and vitamins. I mix it with mango-flavored Pre-Workout. It's healthy and gives a little boost.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: Are you breathing correctly? Plus, the healing power of the Olympics\n\n9:00 a.m. The thing I love doing right now that I've never really had time to do, but I obviously have a lot of time now, is gardening. It's springtime, so everything is blooming. I'm outside for a solid hour in the morning, picking weeds, watering the plants, admiring the new growth. There's something very peaceful and nurturing. It's amazing that gardening is my new favorite thing to do in the morning.\n\n11 a.m. We try work out every day, do something physical. Especially right now. motion equals emotion. Whenever I'm not moving, my brain starts going a little busy. We do something outside or in the garage. I just need to move.\n\nOn creating televised routines from home: Choreographing with limited home space has definitely required creativity. But it focuses me. Normally you have a camera operator. But it's just Hayley and me. We have to fix the camera, perform, look at it. And it's like we moved out of frame or the angle's not good. Constant trial and error. Fortunately, we've been part of a lot of shows and tours. So a lot of the costumes didn't make it back to wardrobe, they make it back to our closets. Like those chimney sweep outfits or the Belle costume.\n\nI did see my neighbor outside while I was in full Lumiere costume and I was like, \"Don't even ask me about it.\" That was hilarious.\n\nOn dancing for stress relief: When I'm dancing professionally or to create something, I'm in that zone. When I'm just dancing for fun, it doesn't look good. I kind of dance like a fool, honestly, like that embarrassing uncle at a wedding. But the truth is, moving around freely with no rules is definitely liberating and makes you feel good.\n\n6 p.m. We start making dinner. I don't know my way around the kitchen at all. I'm a sous chef to Hayley. I call it \"Hayl's Kitchen.\" She directs, \"Wash this, watch this, peel this.\" We like to watch shows like \"The World's Most Extraordinary Homes\" while we cook. I just love architecture. So there's often times we'll be cooking and I'll fall into a daze watching and she'll be like, \"Babe, we need those things.\" And I'm like, \"Sorry, sorry.\" But it's fun and nice to create something. I clean up afterward. That way, I feel I've done my part.\n\nDessert treat: We eat healthy all day. But after dinner is when the candy, popcorn, chips and salsa, and Twizzlers come out. Hayley has made her own ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I was like, \"I didn't know we had that machine.\" She made something called S'mores Yumminess. It's graham-cracker crust with marshmallow fluff and chocolate, more graham cracker on top. She bakes it, and it's insane. She's surprising me with these skills.\n\nOn working through relationships: After six weeks of being with each other 24\/7 is when we started to become like, \"OK, we might've reached our limit here.\" But it's been really good, actually. If we don't agree on something or get into an argument, it's very short-lived. Because at this moment of time, we're just thankful for our health and for everything. We don't take that for granted. Also, when you're with somebody, it's not like, \"OK, I'm leaving, I'm going to go cool off out here.\" It's like, \"OK, we've got to figure this out as fast as possible.\" So it's been good.\n\nWhat I'm streaming: We knocked out \"Tiger King\" pretty quickly. Fascinating and disturbing. We managed to get through \"Ozark,\" all three seasons. We're loving Netflix's \"Queer Eye,\" which is a great transformational show.\n\n11 p.m. I head to bed at night like 11. This is after we'll watch something on the couch. She's out after like 30 seconds, mouth agape out cold. But I'll watch the movie or the show until about 11.\n\nWhen quarantine ends: We're going to Yosemite or a national park that is just beautiful. Nature is just the ultimate. Right now with the cats, we're seeing straight up \"National Geographic.\" When you watch them all day, you see behavior you've never seen before.\n\nRead more Quarantine Diaries:\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Jimmy Fallon's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Naomi Campbell's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Madeline Albright's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Henry Winkler's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Peter Gallagher's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Lindsey Vonn's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Deepak Chopra's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Jameela Jamil's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read LeAnn Rimes' diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read 'Patriot Act' host Hasan Minhaj's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read 'Queer Eye' star Bobby Berk's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read hip-hop star Tory Lanez's diary\n\nA day in the life of my quarantine: Read Kyra Sedgwick's diary","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":785,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/5\/11\/21255165\/northwestern-furloughs-university-evanston-coronavirus","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-11","author":"['Mitch Dudek']","title":"Northwestern announces 250 furloughs, $90M budget shortfall","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/22HXz1qGqVVny0OScl45mdfd-Aw=\/0x215:3000x1786\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19961507\/merlin_12197707.jpg","body_text":"Due to revenue losses caused by the pandemic, Northwestern University on Monday announced plans to furlough about 250 workers, reduce salaries for university leaders, suspend contributions to retirement plans and draw more heavily on its endowment fund.\n\nThe measures were enacted to help address a projected $90 million budget shortfall this year, university leadership said in a message to the Northwestern community.\n\n\u201cEven if we resume on-campus activity in the fall, as we hope to do by phases, we are likely to see a significant shortfall in the 2021 fiscal year as well, perhaps as great as or greater than what we are experiencing this year,\u201d the note signed by President Morton Schapiro said.\n\nUniversity leaders will be taking a 10% to 20% cut in pay.

The 250 workers who are being furloughed are staff members who are unable to work remotely or whose workloads have been significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see repercussions from the pandemic for some time.

Most rely on samples collected from patients using nasal swabs. The samples are then analyzed using a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects viral RNA. These tests can be highly accurate, in some instances detecting the virus in 95% of cases.\nThe first diagnostic tests to get U.S. regulatory approval required that a sample be shipped back to a laboratory to be analyzed, slowing the speed at which patients could receive results. More recently approved diagnostic tests can be conducted at the same location where the sample is taken and provide results in minutes.\nExamples:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2Authorized for use by U.S. regulators in March, Roche's website says it is currently shipping around 8 million tests per month. It requires a sample taken by nasal swab be sent back to a lab for analysis. Roche says studies show it can detect very low levels of the virus with 95% accuracy. - Abbott ID Now\nApproved in late March, Abbott\u2019s rapid, point-of-care molecular diagnostic test can provide results on site to patients within minutes. As of May 4, Abbott said it is producing 50,000 of these tests per day, and plans to ramp up to 2 million by June. A study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic showed the test detected the virus in around 85% of cases.\nANTIGEN TESTSEarlier this month, U.S. regulators authorized the first antigen test, a new category of diagnostic test. This type of test scans for proteins that can be found on or inside of a virus. They test samples taken from the nasal cavity using swabs. Antigen tests can detect the virus very quickly and can potentially be produced at lower cost.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration says antigen test production can potentially scale to millions per day. But they produce false negatives at a higher rate than molecular diagnostics tests.\nExamples:- Quidel Corporation Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIAAuthorized for use earlier this month, Quidel said the test picks up around 80% of COVID-19 cases.\nANTIBODY TESTSAntibody tests take small samples of patients\u2019 blood and scan them for antibodies, which the immune system produces in response to a virus. They can be conducted in labs or through on-site tests that provide results in minutes.\nAntibody tests, also known as serological tests, are not as effective as molecular diagnostic tests in catching COVID-19 at early-stages, when patients may not yet be producing antibodies. But they can confirm if patients previously had the virus and have antibodies that might protect them against future infection.\nThe FDA recently tightened rules on serological test developers after a proliferation of unauthorized tests raised questions about their reliability. Researchers have not confirmed whether recovered patients who are producing antibodies are fully immune to COVID-19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Examples:- Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG AssayResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine say the test, which Abbott launched in April, has a specificity of 99.9% and a sensitivity of 100%, suggesting very few false positives and no false negatives. Abbott has already shipped more than 10 million antibody tests to hospitals and labs.\n (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":834,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/news\/2020\/5\/12\/21251998\/coronavirus-international-nurses-day-michelle-latona-mount-sinai-hospital","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-12","author":"['Neil Steinberg']","title":"Nurses: Tough, tender pros who love their jobs","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/c_bZbOWfsmvIJWtuRswTGyPjXCY=\/0x217:3000x1788\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19955454\/STEINBERG_05XX20_2.jpg","body_text":"Michelle Latona is no hero. She\u2019s a nurse, in the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nLatona certainly doesn\u2019t consider herself heroic.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI wake up every morning and I come to work and do my job.\u201d\n\nA job that demands she tend to the sick and the dying for 12 hours at a stretch. To juggle patients, rooms, medicines, doses, equipment, colleagues, hours, breaks, all the time keeping focused on the central task: making people well again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saving lives the entire time,\u201d she said, admitting that since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Chicago in mid-March, things have changed.\n\n\u201cThis is a different time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve continued to show up to work and do what I do.\u201d\n\nLatona never knows what\u2019s coming through the door.\n\n\u201cThis is a trauma center,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have gunshots, car accidents. Kids still fall off bunk beds. Now there are extra precautions. We have to go under the assumption that everyone is positive until they\u2019ve proven negative. The COVID adds a little bit of extra stress.\u201d\n\nThat \u201clittle bit of extra stress\u201d has to be heroic, the modesty of the truly courageous, since most folks feel extra stress going to the supermarket, never mind having to intubate COVID-19 patients in an ongoing worldwide crisis hitting nursing much harder than most professions.\n\nNurses are the tip of the spear. The National Nurses Union reports at least 50 nurses have died in the United States from the coronavirus, and some 10,000 have been sickened by it. The only reason the death toll isn\u2019t higher is because nurses tend to be younger, and fitter. Latona says her main hobby outside the hospital is working out.\n\nShe is one of almost 4 million registered nurses in the United States. Since Tuesday is International Nurses Day, it\u2019s worth mentioning that there are 20 million nurses in the world, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of International Nurses Day, that isn\u2019t because it\u2019s new \u2014 the celebration began in 1965. It\u2019s on May 12 because it\u2019s the birthday of British nurse Florence Nightingale, who was in charge of nursing in military hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War. Like nurses ever since, she had to overcome hostile doctors, who at first would not allow the new female nurses in the hospital wards. And like today, Nightingale battled obstinate authorities to get desperately-needed equipment, which she often dug into her pocket to pay for. Nightingale shrugged off attempts to honor her after the war, taking the collection grateful Londoners had taken up for her benefit and using it to found a nursing school in 1860, the first in the world.\n\nAsked what she likes most about nursing, Latona replied:\n\n\u201cOur team here, we have such a strong team. We\u2019re like family. We\u2019re showing up. We\u2019re picking up extra shifts. We\u2019re filling in holes where we need to. We\u2019re helping each other so much.\u201d\n\nPandemic hits home\n\nLatona grew up in Bensenville, her father a Mexican immigrant. Before she worked at Mount Sinai, she worked at a clinic for underserved patients. \u201cI just really enjoyed working with that population,\u201d she said. \u201cLow-income, uninsured, immigrants with no paperwork. I could relate. Just because they\u2019re here doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve to be cared for.\u201d\n\nHer husband is a lawyer, and they have three young children: two boys, Theodore and Benjamin, 6 and 3, and a girl, Victoria, 22 months.\n\n\u201cMy oldest always says, \u2018Do you have to go to work?\u2019 I say, \u2018Yes, I have to go help sick people.\u2019 He\u2019s said, \u2018Mom, I want to go to work to help sick people.\u2019 He understands. All the kids understand when I come home, nobody can touch me until I take a shower.\u201d\n\nLatona feels safe, feels confident coming home to her husband and children.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel comfortable. We\u2019re taking the proper precautions. My kids are all really healthy, we have no preexisting conditions. My husband said, \u2018Do you want to quarantine in a hotel?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Who knows how long I\u2019ll be gone?\u2019 \u201d\n\nVictoria is named after her mother, \u201cprobably my best friend, probably the strongest person. I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a huge caregiver for my kids,\u201d said Latona. Then her mother was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cShe got sick back in March, right when this took off,\u201d Latona said. \u201cShe was intubated, in the ICU for three weeks.\u201d\n\nBeing a nurse, Latona knew what being intubated meant: About 90% of people who go on ventilators don\u2019t survive.\n\n\u201cThe worst part was, she was alone. I couldn\u2019t go to the hospital with her,\u201d Latona said. \u201cShe is in the ER by herself. She calls me and says, \u2018They want to intubate me.\u2019 I immediately started crying, because I knew what that meant. I hung up thinking, \u2018Was that the last time I talked to my mother?\u2019\u201d\n\nLatona had to care for everyone but the one person she most wanted to care for.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely hard to come to work, seeing everything here; trying to focus, trying not to think of my mom,\u201d said Latona. \u201cI want to be present and care for my patient. Especially knowing what my mom is going through.\u201d\n\nHer mother is off the ventilator and recovering; in an odd way, her getting sick made her daughter an even better nurse.\n\n\u201cThe fact my mom is by herself, it makes me more empathetic and understanding of the stress family members are feeling, the panic they are having,\u201d Latona said. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ll get phone calls from the family, and before you might feel, \u2018We\u2019re trying to do work!\u2019 Now there is realization: They\u2019re scared. I completely get it. The patient is scared. The family is scared they can\u2019t be there, and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nSecond career\n\nLatona wasn\u2019t one of those girls who grew up bandaging her dolls and taking their temperature. Nursing wasn\u2019t on her radar.\n\n\u201cIt was actually a second career for me,\u201d she said. She went to Illinois State, studied marketing, soon found herself wrangling the Shrek toys that went into McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals.\n\n\u201cI was thinking: \u2018What did I accomplish today?\u2019 I felt very unfulfilled, not happy with it. I was thinking: \u2018I want to do something to help people.\u2019 I always liked science, and I always liked people. I was having a conversation with my mom, and she said, \u2018I wish I had gone to nursing school.\u2019 That got me thinking that\u2019s the route I want to go. I went to nursing school.\u201d\n\nAnd what part of nursing is more fulfilling than marketing?\n\n\u201cAll of it,\u201d she replied. \u201cIn the emergency room you learn something new every day. You never feel stagnant. You ask, \u2018What can I do?\u2019 and there is always something to improve on, something to learn. The fun part of medicine is you\u2019re never done learning what you can do better.\n\n\u201cWe are such a family here. If you see somebody struggling, you go over to help them. \u2018Give me something to do; what do you need?\u2019 I never feel alone at my job.\u201d\n\nAnd COVID-19? Another chance for nurses to step up and shine.\n\n\u201cEven with everything going on personally, after all this started, I never called in [to take time off]. I felt I owed it to my work family to be here and help them.\u201d\n\nFive years into the profession, Latona has found her home.\n\n\u201cSomething about nursing just called to me, and I\u2019ve been very happy in that decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself doing anything else ever. You\u2019re always learning something.\u201d\n\nLike Marines, like firefighters, there\u2019s an annealed-in-flame quality to nursing. They\u2019ve gone through the worst, together, which makes them strong, as a group and as individuals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all pretty true,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re a tough group of people. We love our job. We see the worst of the worst. The ER is hard because we see somebody\u2019s worst day, every day. We go from somebody passed away in that room, the worst day of that life, and we go in the next room, and that person is having the worst day of their life. That\u2019s why our job is hard. It gets hard.\u201d\n\nHard, though the job is not without benefits. The praise can be a little embarrassing. But the food is appreciated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re been very spoiled, lunch provided for us, really frequently,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of ourselves as heroes. We\u2019re just showing up doing our job. That said, we\u2019re not going to say no to a nice lunch.\u201d","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":853,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/05\/13\/855096128\/alaskan-grocer-takes-longer-to-stock-supplies-because-of-covid-19-restrictions","publisher":"National Public Radio (NPR)","publish_date":"2020-05-13","author":"['Emma Bowman', 'Chad Campbell']","title":"14 Hours And A Costco Card: How A Grocer In Alaska Feeds His Town In A Pandemic","image":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2020\/05\/14\/gettyimages-521871010_wide-c23b146729b1cb1777e39e42fe329a44499b4f18.jpg?s=1400","body_text":"14 Hours And A Costco Card: How A Grocer In Alaska Feeds His Town In A Pandemic\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Steve Proehl\/Getty Images Steve Proehl\/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 10:05 a.m. ET on Friday\n\nThink your grocery store runs are tough these days?\n\nIn the remote Alaskan city of Gustavus, a small-business owner, Toshua Parker, has started traveling 14 hours by boat to Juneau and back to stock up on critical supplies for his store during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe roughly 450 residents in Gustavus rely on Parker's Icy Strait Wholesale for the bulk of their provisions, from fresh produce to hardware to home appliances.\n\nAmong locals, Icy Strait Wholesale is better known as \"ToshCo,\" a play on the name of the store's owner and Costco, where the Gustavus business originally sourced most of its items.\n\nIn normal times, Parker would rely on Alaska's ferry system to deliver goods. Gustavus, a peninsular region surrounded by Glacier Bay National Park, is only accessible by airplane or boat. But ferry services have stalled \u2014 partly because of stoppages related to the coronavirus.\n\nSo, the owner found a workaround.\n\nParker and a crew of staff have been hauling supplies via ship from Juneau, 50 miles away, scheduling each trip around the tides. When Parker finds empty shelves at the local Costco, he gets orders shipped from out of state.\n\n\"It's like Christmas when the load gets here,\" Parker told The Hustle. \"Everyone is waiting for it. Word gets out, and they all seem to know when it's coming.\"\n\nHe credits his 15 employees with helping to keep the store running.\n\n\"They're coming to work every day, no matter what, during this pandemic to make sure the town has groceries,\" he said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition.\n\nThe store has been keeping anxious locals updated on its Facebook page, uploading photos to share the status of the Gustavus-bound ship or a new restock.\n\n\"No reason for panic buying,\" reads one post accompanying a photo of a bulk supply of toilet paper. \"Our supply chain may be occasionally delayed but it's holding. We've got you covered Gustavus!\"\n\nIn the comments, grateful customers express their thanks.\n\n\"We are fortunate to have such dedicated people keeping us fed and supplied,\" wrote one commenter. \"Stoked for flour!!!!\" wrote another.\n\nAs the country faces meat shortages triggered by plant shutdowns and outbreaks amid suppliers, the general store is looking ahead.

Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. \"There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,\" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (https:\/\/bit.ly\/3fJIRqp)\nTwin antibodies may be better than one Scientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a \"cocktail\" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (https:\/\/bit.ly\/2WsbD7b)\nChildren with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kidsChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. \"It was reassuring that they didn't appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,\" Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. \"With this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19.\"\nAmong children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children's asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. \"Even in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,\" Kung said. \"This suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.\"\n(https:\/\/bit.ly\/3cuDM3j)Scientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genomeResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. \"This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,\" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. \"The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes.\" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (https:\/\/bit.ly\/3buhU6A)\nCoronavirus particles in feces may not be infectiousThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood \u2026 you get the idea.\n\n\u201cChrist hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:\u201d Galatians 3:13 (KJB)\n\nThe early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThe cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 AD. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity.\n\nThe bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans \/ satanists do.\n\nI will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television.\n\nI know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics.\n\nBut when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood, an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism.\n\nOver the years we\u2019ve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake, and has the freakiest, most nastiest-looking statue right behind here the pope sits. [It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the pope\u2019s throne has a massive inverted cross on it.]\n\nOccult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree.

He lays out the 6 stock-picking decisions that reshaped his portfolio after the coronavirus meltdown.","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5dcf0a1e7eece553ba774f32?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Todd Ahlsten of Parnassus Investments has run one of the best-performing mutual funds of the last 20 years, succeeding through multiple crises and recessions.\n\nHe credits those triumphs to an approach based on critical businesses and technologies, as well as innovation and the avoidance of highly levered companies. Along the way he's made some prescient market calls.\n\nAhlsten told Business Insider about three big purchases and three sales he made during the downturn as he reacted to the crash and prepared for a recovery.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIf you were picking a fund manager to rebuild your portfolio after it was demolished by the coronavirus, Todd Ahlsten would have a strong resume to show you.\n\nAhlsten took cover as manager of the Parnassus Core Equity Fund in April 2001, after the dot-com bubble burst and as a recession began. By underweighting tech stocks and avoiding companies with questionable business models that weren't likely to bounce back, he crushed the market in 2001 and 2002.\n\nJust a few years later, in 2005, he concluded that a bubble was forming in the housing market and sold the fund's investments in the sector. That helped him position himself defensively for the market's steep downturn a few years later, and he beat the market from 2007-09 as well.\n\nAnd when the coronavirus crash hit, his strategy still worked.\n\n\"The playbook of avoiding leverage, avoiding low quality companies, investing in companies with longterm sustainable demand and innovation drove performance,\" he told Business Insider. Kiplinger says the fund's annual return of 8.7% over the 20-year span that ended March 31 is surpassed by only five others.\n\nA major component of his approach involves buying companies that look like they're going to be \"relevant\" for years and years and will improve when downturns end. In an exclusive interview, Ahlsten explained how he's applied that strategy to a radically altered market, giving details on three major buys and three sales.\n\nThe new additions\n\nAhlsten quickly made Amazon one of his biggest positions when the market was near its recent lows. Before that, he'd had concerns about both the stock price and Amazon's approach to renewable energy and to worker pay.\n\n\"We looked at the growth of Amazon Web Services, and they're really going to emerge in a very dominant way,\" he said. \"We do take ESG factors into account and we were looking for some improvement on how they think about the environment and workplace.\"\n\nAhlsten says he paid around $1,700 for the stock, so it's already returned 38.5% and was the biggest contributor to the fund's performance in the first quarter. But he's not eyeing the exits.\n\n\"We think it's going to have a very long, dominant future,\" he said.\n\nAlso joining the ranks was Adobe, a popular tech stock that had suffered a sharp crash.\n\n\"I think we bought it at 26 times earnings. That was a five-year low on the multiple,\" he said. \"We really found opportunity to buy this company that generates phenomenal free cash flow, over 40% operating margins that can expand. ... We really think they're in a great position.\"\n\nThat's worked out so far, as the stock has rallied 25% from its mid-March low.\n\nLastly, Ahlsten doubled the fund's stake in Alphabet, which nosedived about 30% as investors wondered if its advertising revenue was going to crater. Having owned the stock since early 2007, he was comfortable betting on a comeback.\n\n\"We think search and their assets will be even more important,\" he said. \"They can invest in autonomous driving. While some people are pulling back, Google will continue to invest.\"\n\nAlphabet stock is up more than 15% in the current quarter, which almost doubles the gain made by the S&P 500.\n\nAhlsten also parted with the fund's two worst performers during the quarter because their businesses have been upended by the pandemic and recovery looks far away. One of those was Sysco, a food distributor that represented 3% of his portfolio at the end of 2019. Its value is down about 45% since mid-December.\n\n\"I owned that stock for 15 years, but things have changed,\" he said, citing the large number of restaurants that are likely to go out of business and the possibility that people won't be as interested in dining out.\n\nMuch the same holds for his former 1% position in Starbucks, which he sold, and his investment in Disney, which Ahlsten cut to about 1% of the fund from 3.8%.\n\n\"Disney Plus is doing well, but the parks could be a long road (to recovery),\" he said .\"The movie studios have a longer road to get content out. And then clearly with sports and ESPN (there are) some headwinds there.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":984,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/2020\/5\/15\/21260373\/abbott-laboratories-coronavirus-rapid-test-donald-trump","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Jill Colvin']","title":"Trump still confident in Abbott Labs\u2019 rapid COVID-19 test despite false negatives","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/7Oj8Lr5bkwBxsMuCmJdvpbs00fc=\/0x0:3972x2080\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19980872\/Virus_Outbreak_Testing_Problem.jpg","body_text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump expressed no concerns Friday about a rapid coronavirus test from Abbott Laboratories that the White House has been relying on to ensure his safety, despite new data suggesting the test may return an inordinate share of false negatives.\n\nTrump expressed his confidence in the test from the north suburban drug manufacturer after a preliminary study by New York University researchers reported problems with it. Trump and his deputies have have promoting the 15-minute test as a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it was investigating preliminary data suggesting the Abbott test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing infected patients.\n\n\u201cAbbott is a great test; it\u2019s a very quick test,\u201d Trump said at a Rose Garden event to highlight his administration\u2019s efforts to develop a vaccine for the virus. \u201cAnd it can always be very rapidly double checked.\u201d\n\nThe test is used daily at the White House to test Trump, key members of his staff as well as any visitor to the White House complex who comes in close proximity to the president or Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of it, but we still have confidence in the test or we wouldn\u2019t have it on the market,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox Business Network.\n\nWhite House officials on Friday continued using the Abbot ID Now test. Reporters at the White House underwent the test before Trump\u2019s Rose Garden event. The president noted that the administration officials and staff around him, not all of whom were wearing masks, also had undergone testing Friday.\n\nTrump, who also did not wear a mask, was asked why not everyone was wearing a face covering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tested, we\u2019ve all been tested and we\u2019re quite a distance away, and we\u2019re outdoors,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI told them I gave them the option they can wear it or not.\u201d\n\nAzar described the FDA warning as a routine announcement that comes after medical manufacturers submit any type of negative information about their product.\n\nTrump has praised the Abbott test as \u201cvery quick, very good\u201d and alluded to the tests helping keep him safe.\n\nFDA commissioner Steve Hahn said that if a person is suspected of having the disease caused by the coronavirus, \u201cit might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That\u2019s what our guidance is about.\u201d\n\nHahn, asked on CBS on Friday whether he\u2019d continue to recommend using the test at the White House, said, \u201cThat will be a White House decision.\u201d But he said the test is on the market and the FDA continues to \u201crecommend its use or to have it available for use.\u201d\n\nFederal health officials have been alerting doctors to the potential inaccuracy in the test, which is used at thousands of hospitals, clinics and testing sites across the United States.\n\nThe FDA warning came a day after New York University researchers reported results suggesting Abbott\u2019s test can miss up to half the infections caught by a rival test made by Cepheid. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and was based on about 100 patients.\n\nThe researchers found that Abbott\u2019s test, run on the company\u2019s portable ID NOW system, missed one-third of the infections caught by Cepheid\u2019s test when swabs were stored in liquid used to transport laboratory samples. When the samples were kept dry the test missed 48% of the cases flagged by Cepheid\u2019s test.\n\nThe researchers called the test\u2019s performance \u201cunacceptable,\u201d due to the risk of falsely clearing patients who could spread the infection to others. They acknowledged shortcomings of the study, including the time needed to transport patient samples to the device for processing.\n\nAbbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers used the test \u201cin ways that it was not designed to be used.\u201d\n\n\u201cID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe company pointed to other independent study results that found the test accurately detected 90% or more infections.\n\nLast month Abbott changed the instructions for its test to explicitly warn against putting patient samples in transport chemicals. The update came after researchers at the Cleveland Clinic reported a 15% false negative rate for samples stored in the chemicals.\n\nThe FDA said it was reviewing the data with Abbott and was working on a letter to health care providers about potential accuracy issues. The agency said physicians may need to confirm the results of a negative Abbott test if patients have symptoms of the virus. Regulators said they are requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies on the test\u2019s accuracy.\n\nFederal contracting data show the White House spent $140,666 on the Abbott rapid test kits in April.

These bills attempt to protect the American economy from long-term harm caused by stay-at-home orders and respond to the overall impact of the virus.\n\nOn Friday, the House approved a Democrats-only bill to spend another $3 trillion. Republicans have rejected the proposal, known as the HEROES Act, and are calling for a pause on new aid. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the latest legislation is her starting point for any new negotiations.\n\nIn several cases, Congress voted on the relief spending with little time to review the proposals and without an official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. But now CBO has released estimates showing that the costs of some programs are expected to outpace early projections \u2014 driving up the total cost of the bills.\n\nThese long-term expenses will be added on top of recent projections from the CBO that the U.S. deficit would be more than $3.7 trillion in 2020.\n\nThe NPR Politics Podcast House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill Listen \u00b7 14:56 14:56\n\nNPR reviewed data and estimates reported by the CBO to break down how Congress allocated money to respond to the pandemic. Those estimates, known as scores, detail how much the agency expects programs will cost and how those measures will impact the debt, deficit and government revenue.\n\nIn some cases, Congress approved a fixed amount of money for a program, like the Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses.\n\nIn other cases, like the expanded unemployment insurance and tax credits for emergency paid family and sick leave, Congress approved the credits and their values but did not put a cap on the expenditures. When that happens, the CBO estimates the number of people and companies that may take advantage of the program. The CBO often provides those estimates in two-year figures, in part because it may take time for businesses and individuals to file claims.\n\nHere's how the coronavirus relief money breaks down.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe bulk of the support for individuals was approved in the second and third packages, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Stability Act, also known as CARES.\n\nThe biggest expenditures on individuals have been on cash relief payments, expansions to unemployment assistance, emergency family and medical leave.\n\nCash relief payments: $293 billion (estimated)\n\nMany people have already started to receive direct deposits totaling as much as $1,200 under the program known as recovery rebates. Individuals earning less than $75,000 can expect a one-time cash payment of $1,200. Married couples would each receive a check and families would get $500 per child. That means a family of four earning less than $150,000 can expect $3,400.\n\nThe checks start to phase down after that and disappear completely for people making more than $99,000 and couples making more than $198,000.\n\nThe cash payments are based on most recent tax filings. People who receive Social Security payments, people experiencing homelessness and others who don't typically need to file tax return are still eligible, too.\n\nExpanded unemployment insurance: $268 billion (estimated).\n\nThe third piece of legislation included temporary changes to federal unemployment benefits, including a supplemental benefit for all workers and new protections for gig workers.\n\nUnder the legislation, states will still pay base unemployment to people who qualify. That amount varies state by state, as does the amount of time people are allowed to claim it. Congress added $600 per week from the federal government on top of whatever base amount a worker receives from the state. That boosted payment will last through the end of July.\n\nFor example, if an out-of-work person is receiving the national average of about $340 per week, under the new federal program their take-home pay will be $940.\n\nThe legislation also adds 13 weeks of unemployment insurance. People nearing the maximum number of weeks allowed by their state would get an extension. New filers would also be allowed to collect the benefits for the longer period.\n\nThe estimated cost also includes a new, temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program through the end of this year to help people who lose work as a direct result of the public health emergency.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office made their predictions based on a model projecting an unemployment rate reaching 14% in the second quarter of this year and remaining at 10% at the end of 2021.\n\nAdministration officials have admitted in recent weeks that the rate could continue rise in the immediate term before recovering. The scorekeepers specifically noted that this is just a projection and the numbers could change, which would in turn change the overall cost of the changes to unemployment insurance.\n\nEmergency family and medical leave: $105 billion (estimated).\n\nThe second bill congress approved included new tax credits for businesses to support emergency family and medical leave.\n\nUnder the bill, certain employers are required to give up to 80 hours of fully paid sick leave if the employee is unable to work because they are in quarantine and\/or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking medical care. Those employers would also have to approve up to 80 hours of partially paid leave for people caring for someone under the same conditions or to care for a child under 18 whose regular child care facility or school is closed.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects that offering employers fully refundable credits against payroll taxes to compensate employees for the leave will cost the government about $105 billion. This cost is unlike a program where the federal government pays for the benefit directly. Instead, the cost is based on the expectation that the Treasury Department will lose revenues as a result of the policies.\n\nCost reductions for individuals on federal health insurance programs: $8.6 billion (estimated two-year cost)\n\nThe second coronavirus relief bill eliminates any cost-sharing for people seeking testing and treatment for COVID-19 under Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. This was intended to make it easier for low-income people to get tested.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe total amount available to big businesses is well over $500 billion. The CARES Act includes a section described as Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy. That is the long way of describing aid for big businesses. This includes emergency lending from the federal reserve, credit assistance to airlines and pandemic relief for airline workers.\n\nExtra lending authority for the Federal Reserve: $454 billion (this money is expected to be fully recouped with fees and repayments)\n\nThis portion of the bill has a big price tag up front, but the CBO estimates that the repayment, fees and other economic activity will make up for the initial spending. They do not consider it a true cost to the federal budget or the deficit. The chart includes the money because it is an approved expenditure, but it is considered in a separate category than the remaining spending. The Federal Reserve has also taken separate actions that don't involve Congress.\n\nAirlines: $58 billion\n\nThis money is allocated to help airlines stay open. One portion of that money is set aside to help cover employee wages, salaries and benefits divided up as up to $25 billion for passenger air carriers, up to $4 billion for cargo air carriers, and up to $3 billion for airline contractors.\n\nLoading...\n\nThere is more than $800 billion in small business aid spread across the four bills that have passed so far. The biggest portion of that sum is dedicated to the forgivable loans in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The first round of PPP \u2014 $349 billion \u2014 ran out in less than two weeks. Congress approved another $321 billion that is still being spent.\n\nSmall businesses also have access to $21 billion in disaster grants plus some additional loan subsidies. There's also a tax credit for keeping employees on payroll that is estimated to cost about $52 billion.\n\nLoading...\n\nSome elements of the CARES act support a wide range of businesses without the size limitations included in the PPP. The legislation establishes a fully refundable tax credit for businesses of all sizes that are closed or distressed to help them keep workers on the payroll. The credit is expected to cost about $52 billion.\n\nThe goal is to help businesses re-hire employees that have already been laid off or furloughed. The credit covers to 50% of payroll on the first $10,000 of compensation, including health benefits, for each employee.\n\nFor employers with more than 100 full-time employees, the credit is for wages paid to employees when they are not providing services because of the coronavirus. Eligible employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees could use the deduction even if they aren't closed.\n\nOther broader business supports include a delay in when payroll taxes are due, which the CBO estimates will cost $352 billion up front but will be largely repaid years in the future. There are also tax changes increasing the cap on net operating losses and changing the rules for interest deductibility.\n\nLoading...\n\nAll four bills include money to help support hospitals and public health systems. The most expensive items include funding for research and development, direct aid to hospitals and care centers, and money to offset more of the cost of treating Medicare patients.\n\nThe first bill focused primarily on public health and global health. It was passed in the weeks before it was clear how deeply the coronavirus would affect the U.S. It included $3.1 billion for vaccine and treatment research, $3.2 billion for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.2 billion for the State Department to carry out global health programs.\n\nThe CARES Act provided $1.32 billion for community health centers that provide health care for roughly 28 million people.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got another $4.3 billion from CARES and the Strategic National Stockpile received $16 billion.\n\nLoading...\n\nCongress has set aside roughly $28 billion to help pay for testing and access to testing. Other spending areas, including funding for the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health have been used to boost testing capacity and speed up the process of approvals.\n\nLoading...\n\nStates and local governments have access to funds in a number of programs, particularly public health funding and money for publicly run hospitals and community health centers.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response bill included $1 billion for state and local administrative costs, and CARES included $150 billion in direct aid to states for the coronavirus response.\n\nLoading...\n\nThere is long list of miscellaneous programs including those that shore up social safety net programs but do not pay money directly to individuals.

And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.\n\nThere have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.\n\nThe state\u2019s overall positivity rate \u2014 the number of positive cases compared to total tests received within the last 24 hours \u2014 was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a required benchmark to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s regional reopening plan.\n\nBut the positivity rate is a seven-day rolling average and the data lags, Pritzker\u2019s office has said. Each of the state\u2019s four regions must be under that rate for 14 days to advance to the third reopening phase, which allows some \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses to resume limited operations.\n\nGraph not displaying properly? Click here.\n\nThe current seven day average of the positivity rate is 12%, Pritzker said, down from an April peak of 23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is lower is because of increased testing.\n\n\u201cRemember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we\u2019ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, we\u2019ve nearly doubled that, with an average of 20,000 tests per day,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThe good news is that our current statewide positivity rate is under 14% on average for the last 14 days. And that\u2019s likely becoming a better indicator of the true infection rate among the general public than it was when testing was far more limited.\u201d\n\nPritzker also announced six new testing sites in Chicago, in Little Village, Pullman, Hanson Park, Englewood, Gage Park and Bridgeport.\n\nThe state is also launching four new drive-thru sites. Starting Saturday, a drive-thru site in Chatham will begin testing, as well as sites in Champaign, Peoria and Rolling Meadows.\n\nAll testing is free, and the sites will be open seven days a week.\n\nDr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health, said as of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state\u2019s hospitals with COVID-19. Of those, about a quarter of them \u2014 1,129 \u2014 were in intensive care units, and 675 were on ventilators.\n\nHospital metrics are also key to Pritzker\u2019s reopening plan. To get to Phase 3, regions must show no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms for 28 days, and have at least 14% of ICU beds, medical and surgery beds and ventilators available.\n\nEzike also issued recommendations for expectant mothers, warning they must be tested for the coronavirus before they\u2019re admitted for delivery.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, many of the symptoms associated with labor can mimic or cover up symptoms of COVID-19, so we could easily escape detection with just symptom screening,\u201d Ezike said. \u201cBut we also know that many people with COVID-19 are completely asymptomatic.\n\nEzike said early data from hospitals show a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% fo expectant mothers admitted for labor. She said women may be at further risk of additional complications if they have COVID-19.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1063,"url":"https:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/5\/15\/21260353\/cook-county-juvenile-detention-coronavirus-covid-19-cases-office-chief-judge-circuit-court","publisher":"Chicago Sun-Times","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['David Struett']","title":"7 more workers at Juvenile Detention Center contract COVID-19","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/uZ2LWjegUgJfihsxejA66uPwcU4=\/0x153:1292x829\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19876953\/Screen_Shot_2020_04_06_at_4.03.23_PM.png","body_text":"Seven more employees of Cook County\u2019s Juvenile Temporary Detention Center have tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Friday.\n\nThere are now six detainees and 17 employees at the facility that have contracted the coronavirus, according to the Circuit Court of Cook County\u2019s Office of the Chief Judge spokesman Pat Milhizer.\n\nSix of the employees tested positive after receiving on-site tests that began last week for all employees at the detention center, Milhizer said.

However, Hahn said the agency recommends that the Abbott Laboratory test, which is used to test President Donald Trump and White House staffers, still be available for use.\n\nThe FDA issued an emergency authorization in March for the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care test, which delivers results in minutes. The FDA published a warning about it on Thursday after an NYU Langone Health study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it might return false negatives \u2014 meaning it might say a person doesn't have the virus when they actually do.\n\n\"What we're saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test. However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem, so FDA is digging into it, and we're working with Abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance,\" Hahn said on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday. \"That being said, the test is on the market. We continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use.\"\n\nHahn also noted that point-of-care tests in general \"would have a lower sensitivity than a test that's based in the laboratory.\"\n\n\"We've known that for years,\" he said, but added that the data the FDA used to grant the emergency use authorization for the Abbott test \"were very robust.\"\n\nThe purpose of the new FDA warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does.\n\n\"So for example, if a person you suspect \u2014 a doctor suspects a person has the disease, it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about,\" he said.\n\nHahn said the FDA is providing guidance to the White House about the test, but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it. Mr. Trump has praised the test as \"ultra-fast\" and \"very accurate.\"\n\nAbbott said while some studies have shown the \"sensitivity performance percentages,\" or true positive rates, of the test to be in the 80s, others have shown it at or above 90%, and one showed it as high as 94%.\n\n\"We're seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used. In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,\" the statement said. \"While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.\"\n\nThe company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue \"to optimize\" the test.\n\nHahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the United States.\n\n\"We continue to work with close to 300 test developers. We have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this,\" he said. \"We recognize the need to get more tests on the market, and we're working with developers to do that.\"\n\nHe said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests, including the need for data before authorizing a test and an \"unprecedented demand for the tests.\"\n\nHahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach, but said, \"there are unique circumstances in the states.\"\n\n\"The governors understand what best happens in the states, and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions,\" he said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1076,"url":"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/nation\/coronavirus-has-changed-online-dating-heres-why-some-say-thats-a-good-thing","publisher":"PBS NewsHour","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Courtney Vinopal']","title":"Coronavirus has changed online dating.

So, out of boredom, she turned to a social activity she could still do from home: She got back on the dating app, Bumble.\n\nAngelo said she\u2019s been rotating through online dating apps \u2014 she\u2019s also tried Tinder and Hinge \u2014 with minimal luck since getting out of a long-term relationship about a year ago, and had recently been taking a break. \u201cYou just see the same people on all of them and then it gets kind of depressing,\u201d Angelo said.\n\nBut something surprising happened this time around: She actually met someone she genuinely likes. With the possibility of sex \u2014 or any physicial intimacy \u2014 off the table for now due to social distancing, she said it was easier to sort out matches who were just \u201ccycling through people\u201d from those who were actually looking for a relationship.\n\nAfter texting for a few days, she organized a virtual date via FaceTime with the match she liked, chatting over drinks for about two hours. The third time, their FaceTime date was over brunch, for about four hours. Eventually, they took the step of meeting in person with a walk in his neighborhood \u2014 albeit keeping a 6-foot distance, with her dog in between them.\n\nIn the midst of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, a frightening global event that has negatively affected people\u2019s lives in many ways, including causing intense loneliness and isolation for some, Angelo found a rare bright spot. It has actually improved her dating life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not used to someone making this much effort,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent time for singles to date,\u201d said Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to Match.com and a senior research fellow at The Kinsey Institute. \u201cPeople have time. They\u2019re not getting dressed up to go to work. And most importantly, they have something to talk about.\u201d\n\nNot everyone, though, is keen to get into online dating, even if spending more time than usual alone at home has made some otherwise happily single people reconsider their feelings about finding a long-term companion. Not to mention that the pandemic has ushered in mass unemployment, higher levels of stress, greater strain for single parents and worries about fatal risks from stepping outside your door \u2014 factors not necessarily conducive to romance. While some have sought solace on dating apps, others are looking to online communities to connect with those who are also having a hard time, or focusing on friends and family who were already part of their life before the coronavirus.\n\nStill, some daters looking for a relationship in the time of social isolation are finding opportunity. \u201cWatch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other,\u201d Angelo said.\n\nDating goes virtual\n\nThe popularity of online dating has grown immensely over the last decade, and is now the most common way that couples in the U.S. meet. A study by Stanford\u2019s School of Humanities and Sciences found that 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting online in 2017, compared with 22 percent in 2009. The number was even higher for same-sex couples that year, 60 percent of whom reported meeting online in 2017.\n\nFifty years ago, a global pandemic might have hindered single people from connecting with prospects through their family, friends or faith communities. But these days, most people are connecting virtually to start anyway. \u201cThe influence of technology on our romantic and sexual lives has been so enormous,\u201d said Justin Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher at The Kinsey Institute. \u201cFrom online dating, to texting, video chatting, sexting, etc., we have already been in the midst of a digital revolution for human courtship,\u201d he added, so it\u2019s not a huge surprise that singles would continue dating this way in the midst of a pandemic.\n\n\u201cWatch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other.\u201d\n\nThe stay-at-home orders issued across the country have been a boon for some of the major online dating apps. \u201cAs a city goes into lockdown, engagement on OKCupid goes up,\u201d the app\u2019s global chief marketing officer, Melissa Hobley, said. Since March, the company has seen a whopping 700 percent increase in the amount of OKCupid users going on a virtual date. The app Hornet, which caters to the gay male community, has seen a 30-percent increase in social feed engagement since social distancing measures began in mid-March, according to CEO Christof Wittig. And the dating app Tinder reported that it saw more engagement on March 29 than on any other day in its history, with more than 3 billion users swiping to connect with people, according to an April 1 press release.\n\nOnce dating app users have made an initial connection, the way that they are getting to know each other has changed significantly during this period of social distancing. Most bars and restaurants, traditional first date spots, are closed down, and those who elect to meet up with a stranger could risk contracting COVID-19 themselves, or spreading it to others.\n\nAs a result, many singles have taken their meetups online, electing to go on virtual dates via Zoom or FaceTime, or through video chat features on the dating apps themselves. Recent surveys conducted by online dating companies indicate that members are more inclined to try this now than ever before.\n\nA study conducted by Match found that while only 6 percent of singles were using a video platform to meet a potential date before the COVID-19 outbreak, 69 percent of singles said they\u2019d be open to chatting over video with someone they met on a dating app during quarantine as of mid-April. Twenty-two percent of these respondents even said they\u2019d consider entering an exclusive relationship with someone they hadn\u2019t met in person, indicating an openness to cultivating relationships mostly online. As of the end of April 23, 51 percent of users on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel said they planned to video chat more, and 18 percent had had at least one video call with a match.\n\nThe outbreak \u201chas sort of turned our social behavior upside down,\u201d Garcia said. He noted that terror management theory \u2014 which suggests that people evaluate their environments and social interactions differently when faced with their own mortality \u2014 may explain why singles have been more open to trying new things during this period.\n\nThis is true for sexual relationships, in some cases. The Kinsey Institute recently conducted a study of a diverse range of adults aged 18-81, and found that while 43.5 percent had seen their sex life decline during the coronavirus pandemic, one in five respondents reported they had tried adding new things to their sexual repertoire, such as sexting, sending nude photos to someone else, or watching pornography. But it\u2019s also true for those pursuing romantic relationships, as these people have had to reconsider what they want, and how best to meet and connect with people under lockdown.\n\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t in lockdown and some guy asked me to do a FaceTime date, I would think that\u2019s strange and weird,\u201d said 35-year-old Nashville resident Maureen Iselin. But now, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just socially acceptable.\u201d After ending a long-term relationship in the fall, Iselin got back on dating apps. Instead of putting her dating life on hold during the pandemic, she recently agreed to chat over FaceTime with a man she met online.\n\nWATCH:What COVID-19 has meant for dating in America\n\n\u201cIt was a whole new way of thinking about dating. Like, do I get dressed up to this? Do I put on makeup? What are we gonna talk about besides the coronavirus and being in quarantine?\u201d Iselin said. She added that going on a FaceTime date took off a little bit of the pressure because they were both in their home environments, and she planned to do one again with the same person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a test of how well you actually converse, and you get to know someone in a different way,\u201d said 26-year-old Naakita Feldman-Kiss, who has been conversing via FaceTime and Zoom with women she\u2019s met on the dating app Lex, and has exchanged gifts with some of them. \u201cThere\u2019s actually this deeper intimacy that I\u2019ve developed with people, because \u2026 it doesn\u2019t really allow for silence in the same way,\u201d Feldman-Kiss said. \u201cI really kind of like the slow burn of getting to know people over phone and video and text,\u201d said Holly Samuelson, a 34-year-old from San Francisco who recently had a date over FaceTime where she and her date sketched drawings of each other (both are artistically inclined \u2014 he\u2019s a builder, while she\u2019s a fashion designer). Although the guy she had been talking to online lives 100 miles away, she said that distance seemed less of a deal breaker since California shut down amid the pandemic.\n\nRachel Ware, a 27-year-old project manager in Atlanta, recently went on a socially distant jog in a park with someone she met through Facebook\u2019s dating feature, and managed to chat with him for a steady 3 miles. She said she actually liked being able to meet up with an online connection in the park because it feels safer and more secure than a bar, for example. \u201cI\u2019m a very private person and I\u2019m very wary about security,\u201d Ware said. \u201cI like parks because they\u2019re a public space, and you can meet someone and not feel the pressure.\u201d\n\nOf course, just because potential suitors are open to video dating doesn\u2019t mean the connection is guaranteed to be strong. \u201cThere will still be time wasters who take phone calls for connection but it doesn\u2019t mean when this is all over they\u2019re looking for a relationship,\u201d said Francesca Hogi, a love and life coach based in L.A. who has a number of clients that have recently tried out virtual dating, including Holly Samuelson.\n\nFor Justin Becker, a 33-year-old lawyer based in Washington, D.C., the coronavirus has more or less put his dating life on hold. He recently chatted over Google Hangouts with a guy he met in person before the pandemic began, but has not done so with anyone he met on a dating app. Becker said he had a hard time believing that video dates could move a relationship forward, with someone he had never met in person: \u201cI feed off someone else\u2019s energy, and I do not get energy through an app whatsoever.\u201d\n\nEmbracing the \u201cslow burn\u201d\n\nBefore the novel coronavirus hit, U.S. couples were already getting married later in life than ever before. Helen Fisher said what\u2019s happening now is increasing the amount of time people spend in a \u201ccourtship\u201d stage even more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the emergence of a new phase in the courtship trajectory, which is meet online, talk online, then talk in person,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cYes, we\u2019re moving forward to the past. We\u2019re getting to know somebody before the sex.\u201d\n\nBut, for some, slowing down has encouraged them to open up about priorities and feelings earlier on than they would have otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving forward to the past. We\u2019re getting to know somebody before the sex.\u201d\n\nConnor Price, a 40-year-old who recently moved from New York to Los Angeles to work for a music nonprofit, found that true when he started seeing a woman right around the time California shut down. The woman, whom he had met through a close friend, didn\u2019t want to put her mother in danger of contracting the virus. So she and Price started taking nightly walks in their neighborhoods, keeping 6 feet distance from one another.\n\n\u201cIt also almost felt like dating in the Elizabethan era,\u201d Price said. \u201cIf I could get, like, one little finger tip, in between her shoulder blades through a parka, that was like the most exciting thing I\u2019ve had in a month.\u201d\n\nGradually, the two have started to spend more time together, and even shared their first kiss of the pandemic while making dinner one night. Because their activities have been limited, they\u2019ve had serious conversations early on about what they want out of a relationship.\n\n\u201cWe had some very personal conversations much earlier in a relationship I think either one of us would have had because we\u2019re spending actually a lot of time with each other. We kind of cut off the entire rest of the world and it\u2019s just the two of us,\u201d Price said. \u201cNormally, these kind of conversations don\u2019t come out for six months.\u201d\n\nFisher argues that the coronavirus-related shutdowns have made conditions ripe for romance like the one Price entered at the beginning of March.\n\n\u201cWhen your daily habits change, it\u2019s novel. And novelty drives up dopamine in the brain,\u201d the biological anthropologist said. \u201cThe novelty is setting up the brain, priming the brain for love. It\u2019s a very good time for romance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI truly believe this is how you need to get to know people, anyway,\u201d Price said. \u201cThis kind of slowed us both down and made us calculate how and when we wanted to do things. It\u2019s been fun.\u201d\n\nMissing connection\n\nOf course not everyone is looking for the sort of long-term relationship Fisher spoke about, while others who were content being single before the pandemic have had a harder time dealing with being alone as they stay home and miss the normal social interactions of daily life and human touch.\n\n\u201cI think the desire for a romantic relationship is certainly heightened right now,\u201d said Shani Silver, a writer and host of the podcast A Single Serving. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to feel lonely, particularly romantically lonely.\u201d\n\nWhile Silver has shaped her brand around being \u201can advocate for single women as whole, happy beings,\u201d she recently penned an essay for Refinery29 in which she wrote about the challenges of being alone during the coronavirus pandemic. After experiencing a serious bout of depression, she wrote that she suddenly felt \u201can instinctual, threatened, terrified loneliness that needed a hug and an apocalypse partner and neither were available. I didn\u2019t know how long I would be alone for, and for the first time in a very long time, I cared.\u201d In other words, it made her think, \u201cI just want a f***ing husband.\u201d\n\nOn the Facebook group for Silver\u2019s podcast, women grapple with some of the same feelings that she\u2019s experienced while holed up in her Brooklyn apartment, sharing stories about \u201cquarantine\u201d texts from exes or \u201cone and done dates,\u201d the struggle of being the last single person in their social circle, and getting through nights where they just feel very lonely.\n\nSilver said she\u2019s been irked by the ways that online dating companies have sought to capitalize on the pandemic by encouraging more people to make distance dating a priority at this time.\n\n\u201cWhat does that say to single people? \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we know how awful this is that you\u2019re single. We want to make sure you can tell that even during a global pandemic,\u2019\u201d Silver said, criticizing the tone that some dating apps have taken in recent weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful, honestly.\u201d\n\nEven on apps designed for in-person connection, it\u2019s clear that many are feeling isolated and lonely at this time.

STR | AFP via Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 The unemployment rate in China remained near historic highs in April, highlighting the challenges the world's second-largest economy still faces in recovering fully from the economic shock of the coronavirus. China's official, but highly doubted, urban unemployment rate rose to 6.0% in April, from 5.9% in March, according to figures released Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics. \"The pressure on employment is rather large,\" bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua told reporters at least three times during Friday's press conference. That's according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks.\n\nAlthough monthly figures for the overall economy show some recovery, challenges remain, such as resuming work and the impact of the virus overseas, Liu said. \"Right now, the trajectory of economic development still requires observation, but ... based on the results of policies for resuming work and production, we have the confidence, ability and basis for extending the momentum of recovery and improvement.\" Liu noted that the bureau's survey found that at the end of April, the number of migrant workers who had returned to their jobs in the cities was about 90% of what it was a year ago. In early March, official figures showed the return to work for migrant workers from the poorest households in the country was about half of what it was a year ago. More than half of China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by at least a week in an effort to control the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By early March, the virus outbreak had stalled domestically while accelerating its spread overseas. Covid-19 has now killed more than 302,000 people worldwide, including over 4,600 in China.\n\nSlowing economy to hit more jobs\n\nSimilar lockdowns on economic activity in the U.S. sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7% in April, the highest since World War II and up from months of historic lows near 4% or less. In February, the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the unemployment rate jumped to a record high of 6.2%. For the 25 to 59-year-old group, the rate has hovered near 5.5% for the last three months. The average work-hours a week per employee also fell in April by 30 minutes to 44.3 hours, the data showed. China's unemployment data have been highly doubted, even after the country changed its methodology from worker claims to a survey in 2018 in an effort to capture more of the job losses. The urban unemployment rate has hovered near 4% to 5% for the last 20 years. \"We think that pressure on employment will continue,\" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said Friday. He pointed to factors such as fewer new jobs due to slower economic growth, sluggish demand for Chinese exports and a record-high number of university graduates this year. The continued struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to the majority of jobs and growth in China, adds further pressure to employment. Pang pointed to third-party business registration data that showed 460,000 companies closed in the first quarter, while the establishment of 3.2 million new Chinese companies during that time still marked a nearly 29% decrease from a year ago.\n\nTurning to new kinds of work","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1106,"url":"https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2020\/05\/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-development.html","publisher":"Slate","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Mary Harris']","title":"Coronavirus: the race for a COVID-19 vaccine.","image":"https:\/\/compote.slate.com\/images\/ffe2fcbd-adeb-49e5-81ee-82af4e602f21.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=4840x3227&offset=728x485","body_text":"An engineer takes samples of monkey kidney cells as he make tests on an experimental vaccine for COVID-19 at the Sinovac Biotech facilities in Beijing on April 29.

Start your free trial.\n\nUsually, when you run a vaccine experiment, there\u2019s tons of red tape. There are ethical boards to consult and subjects to recruit. Then you have to convince people with money that your research is important enough to move forward at all. But now, there\u2019s none of that. A vaccine for the coronavirus is at the top of the priority list, and everyone\u2019s moving as fast as they can.\n\nDr. Kirsten Lyke is the lead investigator on COVID-19 vaccine trials at the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. She\u2019s worked on vaccines for years\u2014some have panned out, and some haven\u2019t. She knows trials like this one can take a long time, and she also knows that the vaccine she\u2019s testing may not work at all. But she\u2019s optimistic anyway, and hoping to have a vaccine in just a few short months.\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of What Next, I asked Lyke how this is even possible, and spoke with her about the accelerated timeline for the COVID-19 vaccine. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: Right now, your vaccines are at the very earliest phase of human testing, called Phase 1.\n\nKirsten Lyke: A straightforward Phase 1 study is usually 40 to 50 subjects: volunteers who agreed to participate. And it may take anywhere from 12 to 18 months from the time we decide to do a study to ramp it up.\n\nHow does that compare with what you\u2019re doing now?\n\nWe got a call from Pfizer around April 10 right requesting that we consider participation. We had our first Zoom meeting that Wednesday. It was essentially two weeks of round-the-clock work to get the study up and running, and then last week we put out the call to volunteers asking for recruits.\n\nSo are you saying that normally a process that could take a year took four weeks?\n\nA month. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\n\nCan you describe the room where you\u2019re giving the vaccinations? Like, do you have a basement bunker?\n\nIt looks like your regular doctor\u2019s office, where we have several individual rooms where we can put one volunteer at a time. But these are really unusual times. So everyone who comes to campus here in Maryland has to wear a mask. We meet them at the door and do a prescreening. We ask them if they\u2019ve been exposed to COVID-19 or if they\u2019ve had COVID 19, go through a list of questions to discern if they have any symptoms of COVID-19, and then do their temperature. Only then are they allowed to get a little golden ticket that allows them to enter the vaccine area.\n\nFor vaccination, it\u2019s a process. The very first thing we do before is a nasal-pharyngeal swab, just like everyone around the country is getting. So within 45 minutes, we\u2019ve determined whether they\u2019re shedding the virus, and if they\u2019re negative, we can go ahead and randomize and enter them into the system so that we can get them on the docket for vaccination.\n\nIt sounds like you feel like you\u2019re on a clock.\n\nWe are on a clock. We\u2019re on a very rapid sprint overlaying a marathon because every single week we have to recruit a number of volunteers to fill our docket for next week\u2019s dose escalation. So we\u2019re vaccinating this particular round while simultaneously recruiting for next week\u2019s round, when we\u2019ll go to the next dose.\n\nHow many vaccines a week are you giving?\n\nWe\u2019re actually testing four different vaccines at three different dose levels. We\u2019re also doing young people up to age 55. Then we\u2019ll move to older people. Every one of those permutations needs 15 people. This is just, at this stage, a safety and immunity study. We\u2019re looking at immune responses and testing the safety of each of these permutations of the vaccine.\n\nThe overarching design of the study is to test people from ages 18 to 85 and ultimately those with all sorts of risk factors for COVID-19: diabetes, hypertension, lung disease. But right now, in these very, very early stages, we\u2019re testing just the 18- to 55-year-olds who are healthy. Come June, we\u2019ll move to the older age group. Come July, we\u2019re going to move to people who have other comorbidity conditions. And as we work our way along the ladder, we\u2019ll cover the full panoply of people who are most at risk and need to have a vaccine.\n\nOne of the things that is helping for this particular scenario is that everything is shut down. At our center, it\u2019s called severe restriction: We\u2019re not allowed to do other studies or invite volunteers for any of our other ongoing studies. It\u2019s prioritized as COVID-19 studies only.\n\nSo this is all you can work on.\n\nFor the most part, everything has been stalled. Anyone who has expertise in what we do is declared essential and allowed to be on campus to continue research. Everyone has been freed up of their day-to-day work to have time to concentrate on just doing this trial.\n\nHow do you speed things up without cutting corners? Even if you pour people into something, it still takes a toll to move so fast.\n\nObviously a COVID-19 vaccine has not been in people and has not really been in a lot of preclinical studies, where they go into different animals and officials do exhaustive testing. Mice have been injected and we have very limited data, but most of the data that was given to the FDA to move forward on this was with companion vaccines that had been made with the same platform but weren\u2019t necessarily COVID-19-based vaccines.\n\nSo it\u2019s the same method, but it\u2019s not the same virus.\n\nRight. So that may not fly in ordinary situations. But the FDA has agreed that the preponderance of evidence established that this was safe. We have safety data, but to some degree, it might not be the mountains of data that are typically generated before moving forward.\n\nWhat kind of people are volunteering for this? I know you pay them, so there\u2019s an incentive, but who\u2019s going up and saying, \u201cI want to be on the front lines of testing a pretty unproven vaccine\u201d?\n\nThe good thing is that there are a lot of people at home who wanted to do something. Obviously there are people who need some money. But I would say overwhelmingly it\u2019s not people looking for any compensation. Most tell me they\u2019re going to donate their checks. It\u2019s people from the community. It\u2019s people maybe associated with the university but who aren\u2019t in direct patient care.\n\nAre you even really testing for how effective the vaccine is, or is it mostly just safety? I know that in a Phase 1 trial, you may look for a little bit of effectiveness, but you\u2019re mostly just saying, can we do this?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to wait the amount of time it takes for society at large to develop immunity.\u201d \u2014 Kirsten Lyke\n\nRight now we\u2019re interested predominantly in safety and also whether the immune response that\u2019s mounted is actually specific to the virus and in a petri dish can neutralize the antibodies. We are collecting data so that if people develop COVID-like symptoms, we\u2019ll have them do a self-swab and send it to us so we can collect all of that data. The length of the trial for people participating right now is actually 26 months, even though we hope we\u2019ll have picked a vaccine and it\u2019s gone into production well before that. You know, as early as this autumn, they\u2019re still going to be participating and coming in for blood draws so we can see how long their antibody response lasts.\n\nLike a lot of things when it comes to this coronavirus, with this vaccine, we are going to be learning a lot on the fly. Even if it\u2019s proved safe and goes into production in the next few months, we might not know exactly how effective it is until after it gets released. There\u2019s an element of taking it on faith. So what does effectiveness look like in a vaccine like this? I get the chickenpox vaccine and I don\u2019t get that condition. Do you think we\u2019re going to be able to promise that a vaccine we\u2019re working on so quickly for a condition we\u2019re really just learning the contours of?\n\nThere are so many unknowns that it\u2019s impossible to say. I can say that this is what we hope for: that the vaccine we\u2019re developing today is going to work and it\u2019s going to cover people for a reasonable amount of time. And that is where what is reasonable to me may not be reasonable to someone else. Everyone has experience with the flu vaccine\u2014every year we have to make a new crop of vaccines. The total overall efficacy differs year after year, 70 percent, 50 percent.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s zero percent efficacy.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not effective at all. And that would not be acceptable. I mean, we\u2019re hoping for a high level of protective efficacy in a virus that\u2019s not mutating. That\u2019s a lot to ask. We just don\u2019t know how this is going to all play out. All we know is that there are other coronaviruses circulating, like the common cold\u2014which isn\u2019t a deathly illness. Hopefully this will morph into that. But I don\u2019t think we want to wait the amount of time that it takes for society at large to develop immunity.\n\nIn you pre-pandemic work, you focused on diseases like dengue, which is caused by a virus, and malaria, which is caused by a parasite. We\u2019ve been looking for a vaccine for those for years, and we still haven\u2019t found anything, really.\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely correct. Half a million people die of malaria a year. And there is no sense of urgency anywhere up and down the levels of vaccine development.\n\nI wonder if it kind of makes you humbled looking at this coronavirus, with folks saying we want a vaccine in 18 months. You know how hard the work is.\n\nMalaria is a different beast. It is very, very difficult to develop a vaccine because it\u2019s so complicated. The beauty of viruses is they\u2019re so simple\u2014they can\u2019t even replicate themselves. HIV is an exception because it morphs and changes genetically. It\u2019s constantly evolving, so it\u2019s hard to keep up. But Ebola, for example, is a simple virus. It can\u2019t mutate that quickly because it typically ended up killing people before it had a chance to mutate. So it was relatively easy to make a vaccine, and we\u2019re kind of hoping the same thing with COVID-19, not to minimize the difficulty.\n\nYou sound so confident!\n\nWell, I think we\u2019re going to get it. I mean, there are a hundred companies claiming they have a vaccine that they want to bring to fruition. We just happen to have been part of a process that had the financial means and the infrastructure to get it off the ground very quickly. So I hope this one works, but I also hope other vaccines work because by the time we get to autumn and start ramping up production, I don\u2019t think one company is going to be able to develop worldwide mass production immediately.\n\nListen to the full episode using the player below, or subscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1112,"url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/power-line-how-coronavirus-will-permanently-change-the-energy-economy-2020-5","publisher":"Business Insider","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Benji Jones']","title":"Power Line: How coronavirus will permanently change the future of energy, and why cheap oil is not all to blame for the decline of the US shale industry","image":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5ebebcddaee6a87450093737?width=1200&format=jpeg","body_text":"Welcome to Power Line, a weekly energy newsletter brought to you by Business Insider.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWant to get this newsletter in your inbox every Friday?

Not to mention, the window to take advantage of cheap gas for your road trip is closing fast.\n\nIn Wisconsin \u2014 where gas was as low as 87 cents just weeks ago \u2014 the bottom is now up to a whopping $1.44. Who can even afford that?\n\nRising gas prices are just one sign that oil markets are starting to recover, in step with global oil demand. That's great news for an industry that faced one of the worst springs in history.\n\nNow we're starting to ask: What will the energy industry look like when the pandemic is in the rearview?\n\nFor starters, we asked a bunch of CEOs.\n\nWe had the pleasure of interviewing eight top energy execs \u2014 from BP's Susan Dio to Duke Energy's Lynn Good \u2014 about how the coronavirus will change their companies and the industry at large.\n\nTheme 1: The transition to low-carbon energy remains at center stage even as majors slash their budgets. 2020 forecasts aside, the pandemic won't do much to slow it down.\n\nTheme 2: People are craving energy resilience, especially as wildfire and hurricane seasons draw near. That could give residential solar and infrastructure projects a boost.\n\nHere are a few of the comments that stood out to me. You can read all of them here.\n\n\"California had one of the driest months of February in its history, and because of COVID-19, we've seen reports of fewer prescribed burns, which increases the risk of wildfires this fall,\" Sunrun's CEO Lynn Jurich said.\n\n\"We have a wire or a pipe connected to businesses in every county of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,\" CMS Energy's CEO Patti Poppe said. \"The question for us in the midterm is how will those businesses come back.\"\n\n\"We are a little bit worried about the electrification of transportation right now because I think the transportation sector is suffering a lot,\" Energy Impact Partners' CEO Hans Kobler said. \"Electric vehicle sales will be down 40%.\"\n\nI don't know what I'm eating for lunch or where I'll be living in two months, let alone what the world will look like in 20 years.\n\nBut if anyone is up for the task of predicting the future of energy, it's analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie. This week, they sketched out three paths that a recovery could take, and what each means for energy.\n\n\"Full recovery\": A coronavirus vaccine becomes available next year, and governments around the world pour money into spurring economic growth.\n\nOil demand returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2020s and then reaches a peak of more than 110 million bpd by the mid-2030s.\n\nNatural gas and cheap renewable energy sources would slowly replace coal, causing it to decline slightly by 2040.\n\n\"Go it alone\": The virus is tough to defeat, trade and travel are restricted, and the world suffers from a long recession.\n\nGlobal demand for oil increases very little after an initial rebound.\n\n\"By 2030 it is barely any higher than was expected for 2020 if the pandemic had not hit,\" they said.\n\n\"Greener growth\": A short recession is followed by a strong rebound that includes government support for low-carbon energy.\n\nOil demand wouldn't move much for the next decade or so and then decline steeply in the 2030s.\n\nMost remarkably, \"the combined share of oil, gas, and coal in total primary energy drops to 68% in 2040, down from 84% in 2019,\" the analysts said.\n\nAn oil well owned an operated by the company Apache in the Permian Basin near Garden City, Texas Spencer Platt\/Getty Images\n\nOil prices have rallied in recent weeks, but the US shale industry \u2014 once synonymous with American energy dominance \u2014 is not exactly celebrating.\n\nAs we reported earlier this week, its problems began well before the coronavirus pandemic took root.\n\nHistory lesson: In the last five years, US shale companies have failed to deliver investor returns and accrued billions of dollars of debt.\n\nInvestors made a lot of money when they invested on \"the dip\" around 2009, when oil prices were low.\n\nThose investors helped fuel the fracking revolution of the 2010s, which supercharged America's oil output.\n\nAn unintended consequence was that fracking brought M&A \u2014 the main source of capital gains for investors \u2014 to a near standstill over the following years. (I explain why here.)\n\nSo when investors once again backed US shale in the last downturn, beginning around 2014, they never saw returns.\n\nWhere we are now: Of the 500 or so US oil and gas companies backed by private equity, about 400 of them don't have bids, according to an investor who's been tracking the industry for years.\n\nThat means they'll be forced to go into what he called \"blowdown\" \u2014 diverting cash from production to investors, causing oil output to decline over time.\n\nUS production could fall by as much as 4 million barrels of oil per day by the end of next year, the investor said.\n\nWhere we are headed: \"What you're seeing is the rapid shrinkage of the industry,\" he said. \"A lot of companies are going to cease to exist.\"\n\nRead more: '$500 billion in capital destroyed': How the US shale industry vaporized money even before the pandemic struck \u2014 and why the market meltdown is only hastening its decline, according to a top investor\n\n3 big stories we didn't cover\n\nRenewables vs. coal.

Are the decisions made by health regulatory agencies always in the best interest of the public?\n\nA lot of places are mandating that people wear a mask. Some grocery stores here in Canada are making it mandatory for people who want to do some shopping, and Los Angeles County recently mandated that all people must wear a mask when going outside. But do these measures really help? We are living in strange times when people like Bill Gates are getting a lot of T.V. time, as he seems to be the world\u2019s leading \u2018health\u2019 authority on the new coronavirus, what we should do, and how we\u2019re going to stop it. On the other hand, there are several doctors and leading epidemiologists around the world who have been studying viruses for decades that have been censored from social media platforms for sharing their research and opinions. Their interviews are being taken down, and some have even been flagged as \u2018fake.\u2019 Ask yourself, what\u2019s wrong with this picture?

Mainstream media is trying really hard to shape our perception with regards to everything that surrounds the new coronavirus, from treatment, lockdowns, to social distancing and much more.\n\nWe\u2019ve covered a few examples of these experts giving their opinions with regards to how dangerous this virus actually is, what the solution is, treatments and more. If you\u2019re interested you can refer to the articles linked at the bottom of this one. At the end of the day, a lot of what these doctors, scientists and epidemiologists have been saying since the beginning of this outbreak, up until now, has completely contradicted the narrative of federal health regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, social media and other platforms are banning content that opposes and contradicts the WHO, no matter how much evidence is behind the information, or even if the sources are some of the leading experts in the world.\n\nShould there be a digital authoritarian Orwellian \u2018fact checker\u2019 going around the internet telling people what is, and what isn\u2019t? Or should people have the right to examine information, check sources and evidence and ultimately decide for themselves?\n\nSpecial note to our followers: Is 5G safe?

Is this really about our health or is something else going on here? Are there powerful people profiting off of this both politically and financially? Was Edward Snowden correct when he said that the new coronavirus fiasco is no different from 9\/11, in that it\u2019s simply being used to push more authoritarian measures on the population? Just like they remained after 9\/11, will they remain after this coronavirus? Why are there apps tracking people for coronavirus, but not for the pedophiles, murderers and rapists? These are important things to think about.\n\nThere is a lot of conflicting information out there and again, if you\u2019re interested in going a little deeper you can refer to the articles listed at the end of this one.\n\nBut what about masks? Do they really help? How effective are they? According to Dr. Dan Erickson (former emergency-room physician) and Dr. Artin Massihi (emergency medicine specialist affiliated with multiple hospitals) of Accelerated Urgent Care in California, they\u2019re not helping at all.\n\nWhen you wear gloves that transfer disease everywhere, those gloves have bacteria all over them. \u201cI\u2019m wearing gloves,\u201d not helping you\u2026Your mask that you\u2019re wearing for days, you touch the outside of it, COVID, and then touch your mouth, this doesn\u2019t make any sense. We wear masks in an acute setting to protect us, we\u2019re not wearing masks (right now). Why is that? Because we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems. I don\u2019t want to hide in my home, develop a weak immune system, and then come out and get disease. We\u2019ve both been to the ER through swine flu and through bird flu, did we shut down for those? Were they much less dangerous than COVID? Is the flu less dangerous than COVID? Let\u2019s look at the death rates, no it\u2019s not. They\u2019re similar in prevalence and in death rate. (source)\n\nAccording to a study published in BMJ Open in 2015,\n\nThis study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection.\n\nAccording to the study, it was unclear if they help at all, and that they probably need to be worn at all times in acute\/dangerous settings within the hospital to be effective at all.\n\nThere are also other potential health consequences of wearing not just a cloth mask, but also medical masks. The physiological effects of breathing elevated inhaled CO 2 may include changes in visual performance, modified exercise endurance, headaches and dyspnea. The psychological effects include decreased reasoning and alertness, increased irritability, severe dyspnea, headache, dizziness, perspiration, and short-term memory loss. (source)\n\nThis study suggests that masks don\u2019t really help, and depending on the material, they can actually make things worse. That being said, there are studies suggesting that medical masks are indeed effective, but the studies are referring to health care workers in acute settings, not the general public.\n\nBelow is a quote from a very interesting paper published in 2016, titled \u201cThe Surgical Mask Is A Bad Fit For Risk Reduction.\u201d\n\nAs represented by our cinema and other media, Western society expects too much of masks. In the public\u2019s mind, the still-legitimate use of masks for source control has gone off-label; masks are thought to prevent infection. From here, another problem arises: because surgical masks are thought to protect against infection in the community setting, people wearing masks for legitimate purposes (those who have a cough in a hospital, say) form part of the larger misperception and act to reinforce it. Even this proper use of surgical masks is incorporated into a larger improper use in the era of pandemic fear, especially in Asia, where such fear is high. The widespread misconception about the use of surgical masks \u2014 that wearing a mask protects against the transmission of virus \u2014 is a problem of the kind theorized by German sociologist Ulrich Beck. The birth of the mask came from the realization that surgical wounds need protection from the droplets released in the breath of surgeons. The technology was applied outside the operating room in an effort to control the spread of infectious epidemics. In the 1919 influenza pandemic, masks were available and were dispensed to populations, but they had no impact on the epidemic curve. At the time, it was unknown that the influenza organism is nanoscopic and can theoretically penetrate the surgical mask barrier. As recently as 2010, the US National Academy of Sciences declared that, in the community setting, \u201cface masks are not designed or certified to protect the wearer from exposure to respiratory hazards.\u201d A number of studies have shown the inefficacy of the surgical mask in household settings to prevent transmission of the influenza virus\u2026\n\nRelated CE Articles\n\nItalian Politician Says The \u201cLies & Falsification\u201d of COVID-19 Numbers Is Used To \u201cTerrorize Italians\u201d (VIDEO)\n\nJust Like 9\/11 Did, COVID-19 Is Shifting Human Consciousness In A Major Way\n\nLeading Scientist Claims Lockdown & Quarantine is a \u201cHuman Catastrophe\u201d (New Interview)\n\nIs The COVID-19 Pandemic Pushing Humanity To Re-Imagine Normal?\n\nVitamin C For COVID-19: Critical Care Medicine Hospital Chief In Wuhan Provides Updates\n\nTwo Emergency Medicine Doctors On Why Quarantine \u201cJust Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\u201d\n\nIf You Die of a Clear Alternative Cause, It\u2019s Still Listed As A COVID Death\u201d \u2013 Dr. Ngozi Ezike\n\nVimeo Bans Documentary Exposing \u201cBig Pharma\u2019s\u201d Influence Within The World Health Organization\n\nWikileaks Highlights The Influence \u201cBig Pharma\u201d Has On The World Health Organization\n\nNew Study: The Flu Vaccine Is \u201cSignificantly Associated\u201d With An Increased Risk of Coronavirus\n\nBill Gates\u2019 Latest Instagram Post Has Been Bombarded With Accusations & Comments Against Vaccines\n\nRenowned Microbiology Specialist On Why He Believes Coronavirus Measures Are \u201cDraconian\u201d (Video)\n\nRenowned German Pulmonologist Questions Coronavirus Measures & If They\u2019re Necessary (Video)\n\nUpdates On The New Coronavirus Vaccine \u2013 Are You Going To Take It?

Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.\n\nCook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.\n\n1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants\n\nIs Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play?

If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor\u2019s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,\u201d she said then.\n\nBut the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor\u2019s order and she would do what she must.\n\nRead the full report from Fran Spielman here.\n\n12:59 p.m. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts not sure baseball will be played this season: report\n\nCubs chairman Tom Ricketts told season-ticket holders he is not sure baseball will be played this year.\n\nAccording to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can answer that question just yet,\u201d Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. \u201cThe current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.\u201d\n\nThe team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.\n\n\u2014 Sun-Times Staff\n\n12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine\n\nIn a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:\n\nBefore the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.\n\nBut now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation \u2014 I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor \u2014 she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.\n\nMy mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.\n\nThis potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn\u2019t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?\n\nRead this and more letters here.\n\n11:44 a.m. What\u2019s the first meal you\u2019ll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.\n\nWith eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state\u2019s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you\u2019ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won\u2019t be for a while.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We\u2019re now in Phase 2.\n\nSo with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what\u2019s the first meal you\u2019ll want to eat out, and from where?

Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.\n\nIn just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.\n\nThe FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n7:03 a.m. \u2018Grandstanding\u2019 by Grand Old Party? Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?\n\nSPRINGFIELD \u2014 After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.\n\nAnd as they prepare for the Legislature\u2019s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats \u2013 but they want an examination of their own.\n\nGOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.\n\nAnd Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s \u201cRestore Illinois\u201d plan under the microscope with a public hearing.\n\nGOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker\u2019s \u201cRestore Illinois\u201d plan as \u201carbitrary,\u201d saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don\u2019t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19\u2019s impact.\n\nRead the full story by Neal Earley here.\n\n6:45 a.m. With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan\n\nSingularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan \u2014 bankrolled by an existing line of credit \u2014 to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.\n\nNormally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.\n\nThe Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city\u2019s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.\n\nSo the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nRead the full story by Fran Spielman here.\n\nNew cases\n\nAnalysis & Commentary\n\n7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation\n\nWashington to cities and states: You\u2019re on your own.\n\nFor months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic\u2019s financial devastation.\n\nA $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.\n\nWhy? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.\n\nSo what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?\n\nRead the full editorial from the CST Editorial Board here.\n\n6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of \u2018Restore Illinois\u2019\n\nFor many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.\n\nPritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.\n\nIt was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.\n\nPeople did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.\n\nOtherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.\n\nAnd then on May 5 he announced his \u201cRestore Illinois\u201d roadmap to gradually reopen the state.\n\nRead the full column from Rich Miller here.\n\n6:53 a.m. Chicago\u2019s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19\n\nIf Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city\u2019s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.\n\nLast Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago\u2019s flag to mark the city\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago\u2019s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will \u201ctruly warrant a fifth star on our flag.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be blunt. Chicago\u2019s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that\u2019s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.\n\nRead the full Sun-Times editorial here.\n\n6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims \u2014 so let\u2019s see every contract\n\nNow that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it\u2019s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.\n\nNavy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.\n\nNavy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.\n\nAnd just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nLike all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.\n\nRead the full editorial here.","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1136,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/analysis\/202005151079303943-secret-unit-in-uk-foreign-office-working-with-venezuelan-coup-plotters-exposed-by-indy-journalist\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-15","author":"['Mohamed', 'Elmaazi ]","title":"Secret Unit in UK Foreign Office Working With Venezuelan Coup Plotters Exposed by Indy Journalist","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107930\/19\/1079301998.jpg","body_text":"The British government has openly allied with the US in backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3's self-appointment as interim president. But newly obtained government documents by a UK-based investigative journalist reveal a much deeper relationship with members of the coup-government-in-waiting.\n\nJohn McEvoy is an independent journalist who has published in the International History Review, The Canary, Tribune Magazine, Jacobin, Declassified UK, Brasil Wire among other publications. He reported from Venezuela during the coup efforts in 2019, from Colombia during the student protests the same year and from France in 2020 on the Yellow Vests movement and general strike.\n\nMr McEvoy's main research focus is in contemporary British involvement in Latin America - notably British state intervention and natural resource extraction in Colombia since 1989. He speaks English, Spanish and French.\n\nSputnik: You recently published an expos\u00e9 revealing the existence of a secret unit working within the UK Foreign Office that was liaising with elements of the Venezuelan opposition.\n\nWhat exactly did you discover?\n\nJohn McEvoy: I discovered a Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) Unit named the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit, which hadn't previously been acknowledged by either the government, the diplomat involved, nor the Venezuelan opposition, with whom the unit has collaborated.\n\nIt was also found that Juan Guaid\u00f3's representative in the UK, Vanessa Neumann, had spoke with FCO officials about the sustenance of British business interests in Venezuela's 'reconstruction'. Given Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and Neumann's past links with oil corporations, we can only imagine what this means.\n\nSputnik: Who are the key players in this unit?\n\nJohn McEvoy: The only diplomat that we know is involved thus far is John Saville, the former UK ambassador to Venezuela between 2014 and 2017. He's been a diplomat for some decades.\n\nSputnik: Why is this significant, why should this matter to anyone living in Britain?\n\nJohn McEvoy: It's obviously important for UK citizens to know what is being done in their name - be it at home or abroad. In the case of Venezuela, which is undergoing a serious political and economic crisis, it's important that UK citizens know how the UK government is contributing to this - through sanctions, partnering with the US in trying to destabilise the country, and in planning for the country's 'reconstruction' following an imagined coup.\n\nWhen you look at the past record of British destabilisation and 'reconstruction' - in Iraq, Libya, Syria, or Afghanistan, for instance - you get the kind of idea of what might await Venezuela should the government be overthrown. But it's not just about a utilitarian approach, it's also about confronting imperialism. What right does the UK government have in the 'reconstruction' of another sovereign nation?\n\nI'm sure the British population would be alarmed if it were to learn that Venezuela had a specialist unit within its Ministry of External Affairs planning for the 'reconstruction' of Britain.\n\nSputnik: Did the Foreign Office have an explanation for the existence of this unit?\n\nJohn McEvoy: The FCO responded in a way that has characterised British public diplomacy over recent years: that they're trying to 'help' Venezuelans resolve their 'appalling political and economic crisis'. Even the smallest understanding of British foreign policy, and the history of British interventions abroad, would lead one to immediately suspect this explanation. That's before considering the numerous different ways in which the British government has joined in with the economic strangulation of Venezuela over the past 16 months - notably in freezing over $1bn worth of Venezuelan gold held in the Bank of England.\n\nThese sanctions are even more concerning in light of the current coronavirus - Venezuela is struggling to import vital medication for years. What's more, if the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit is so committed to benign objectives such as democracy promotion and political assistance, it's quite a wonder why they kept silent about it since Autumn 2019.\n\nSputnik: How would you respond to someone who says that it isn't that big a deal for the UK Foreign Office to have a group of people whose job is to liaise with opposition figures in another country?\n\nJohn McEvoy: Of course it's within the FCO's remit to liaise with foreign politicians and diplomats. In this case, those with whom it is liaising have been trying to violently overthrow their elected government for the past 16 months (and, in the wider context, since Hugo Chavez was first elected in 1998). The most recent instance came to a head this month when US and Venezuelan mercenaries arrived on the Venezuelan coasts with plans to kidnap the president and gun down \"violent colectivos\" - which is frequently a code-word for working class, usually socialist communities in Venezuela who support the legitimacy and sovereignty of their government and state.\n\nIn March and April 2019, I stayed with the leader of a colectivo in Caracas, Venezuela, for two weeks. This colectivo was dedicated to helping the local children with cultural events and activities - dance, theatre, art, etc. Yet in the international media, colectivos have been comprehensively painted as violent, thuggish supporters of the Venezuelan government. Painting them as 'thugs' or 'terrorists' provides a pre-emptive justification for attacking supporters of the government and those who defend the sovereignty of the Venezuelan state.\n\nWhat this [recent mercenary] plan entailed was a possible massacre of the Venezuelans who would inevitably come out in defence of the sovereignty of their state. The contract for this operation reportedly bears Juan Guaid\u00f3's signature and he is named as the operation's Commander in Chief - and these plans were underway when Guaid\u00f3 visited the UK in January 2020. This is, therefore, a unique situation - the UK government is collaborating, at the highest levels, with political forces that are involved in what many would describe as terrorism.\n\nSputnik: Is there anything about their activities that you still don't know that you want to know?\n\nJohn McEvoy: Yes - another Freedom of Information request has been sent; hopefully there'll be a follow-up article on this latest piece.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1159,"url":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/05\/16\/obama-leaders-arent-even-pretending-to-be-in-charge-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html","publisher":"CNBC","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Hannah Miller']","title":"Obama criticizes coronavirus response \u2014 leaders 'aren't even pretending to be in charge'","image":"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/104359298-GettyImages-622148534.jpg?v=1532563884","body_text":"US President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump to update him on transition planning in the Oval Office at the White House on November 10, 2016\n\nFormer President Barack Obama criticized the federal government's coronavirus response in a thinly veiled swipe at the Trump administration during a virtual commencement address delivered to historically black colleges and universities on Saturday.\n\n\"More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,\" Obama said in his speech. \"A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.\"\n\nThese latest comments could ignite further tension between Obama and President Donald Trump. Obama previously criticized the Trump administration last week, when he called its Covid-19 response \"an absolute chaotic disaster\" during a private call with supporters who formerly worked for him.\n\nBack in March, Trump blamed the country's lack of coronavirus tests on the previous administration. He has also tried to blame the Obama administration for the lack of a vaccine.\n\n\"I don't take responsibility at all,\" Trump said at a press briefing. \"Because we were given a \u2014 a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.\"\n\n\n\nOne of Trump's own top health advisors, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissed the idea that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine during a Senate hearing this week.\n\n\n\nThe White House responded to Obama's speech with a statement defending Trump's coronavirus response, claiming it had \"saved lives.\" At least 88,437 Americans have died from coronavirus and more than 1.4 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nStreamed online, Obama's speech mentioned the difficult circumstances facing graduates that stem from the pandemic, including the current economic recession. In addressing the country's 78 HBCUs, he also made reference to enduring racial inequality in the U.S., which he said can be viewed in how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people of color as well as the recent death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia while jogging. Though Arbery died in February, the two men allegedly responsible were not arrested until May after a video that is said to depict the shooting went viral.\n\n\"We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning,\" Obama said during the speech. \"Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing.\"\n\nObama ended the speech on a note of optimism for the class of 2020, saying that the graduates were all \"role models\" now.\n\n\"Your participation in this democracy, your courage to stand up for what's right, your willingness to forge coalitions \u2014 these actions will speak volumes,\" he said.","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1222,"url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/texas-cases-covid-19-increasing-thousands-reopening\/story?id=70720497","publisher":"ABC News","publish_date":"2020-05-16","author":"['Gina Sunseri', 'Ella Torres']","title":"Texas COVID-19 cases rise, governor's office says more testing being done","image":"https:\/\/s.abcnews.com\/images\/US\/texas-barbershop-rt-rc-200516_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg","body_text":"Texas COVID-19 cases rise, governor's office says more testing being done The deaths are also steadily increasing.\n\nWhat to know about antibody testing\n\nWhat to know about antibody testing Callaghan O'hare\/Reuters\n\nTexas has seen a steady rise in novel coronavirus cases and fatalities since reopening just over two weeks ago.\n\nThere are now 45,198 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

But this night, the patients would be different: It was his first shift treating adult coronavirus patients \u2014 the first adults he's treated in the hospital since medical school six years before.\n\n\"Coming into the hospital, it was a little bit unreal,\" he says. \"The whole floor was filled with adult patients.\"\n\nBy then, COVID-19 cases systemwide at Montefiore Medical Center had gone from just two cases a little over two weeks earlier to more than 700. In response, Montefiore transformed part of the children's hospital into a 40-bed adult COVID unit. All around the city, other hospitals were making similar adjustments. Medical students graduated early. Operating rooms were converted into ICUs. A field hospital went up in Central Park.\n\nBut the surge in New York City has done much more than simply rearrange space and upend protocol. More than 15,000 people have died of COVID-19 there, and that enormous toll will profoundly impact the city's tens of thousands of health care workers for years to come. Lorenzoni is one of them.\n\nA little over a month ago, Lorenzoni answered a request from NPR for hospital workers to describe what work was like at the epicenter of the crisis. Lorenzoni began recording his reflections for NPR after his shifts, sitting at the desk in his bedroom, speaking into his iPhone in a slow, measured voice.\n\nJust a few weeks earlier, Lorenzoni had watched \u2014 along with many other Americans \u2014 how the Italian medical system had been brought to its knees. It seemed likely it was only a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus would arrive in the U.S. And of course, by then, it already had.\n\n\"I knew I could be involved because of what happened in Italy,\" Lorenzoni says, and adds, \"a pediatric physician needing to take care of critical adult patients is unheard of.\"\n\nStill, he was surprised he was recruited so early.\n\n\"They filled us up pretty quickly and the patients were very sick. I remember in the first couple shifts we were putting breathing tubes in patients on a floor that doesn't usually do that,\" he says.\n\nTreating adults hit him hard, he says. He's used to working with kids.\n\n\"Pediatrics is a career where most of your patients get better,\" he says. \"But these were very with-it adults who were scared. They knew what the risk was.\"\n\nIt felt important to him, he says, to be honest about what was happening, even when the news wasn't good.\n\n\"One of my main mantras is to sit down with somebody. And that was very tough in this environment because our protective equipment didn't surround us,\" he says. \"So we were discouraged from sitting down on the bed next to a patient to have a deep discussion or sitting down in a chair and being at eye level with the patient.\"\n\nInstead, he says he would do his best to give his patient a sense of comfort by leaning against the wall, trying not to stand over or talk down to them.\n\n\"I think patients can see right through a physician when they try to dance around a difficult conversation,\" he says. \"You can be honest with a person and they appreciate that honesty.\"\n\nOne patient, a man in his mid-forties, kept asking how bad his condition was. As the man's health deteriorated, Lorenzoni was open with him, aware that those hard conversations \u2014 like what it means to be put on a ventilator \u2014 are sometimes the last a patient will ever have.\n\n\"I remember that he asked me, 'doc, I know I'm not getting better, what else can we do?' and unfortunately I had to answer that we'd been doing everything we could. And he broke down. And I broke down a little bit in tears,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elias Williams for NPR Elias Williams for NPR\n\nIn his recordings, Lorenzoni lingered on the quieter moments. He spoke about why it was important to take time with his patients, especially because visitors were not allowed. One woman, in her early 30s, often wanted staff to check in on her, beyond the usual rounds that doctors and nurses make.\n\n\"I feel like she knew she wasn't doing well, and she wanted the company,\" Lorenzoni says.\n\nWhen he would leave for the day, he'd check in on her to make sure she was okay, but he worried that she would take a turn for the worse by the time he returned.\n\nEventually, that's what happened. She needed to be placed on a ventilator to breathe.\n\n\"One of the things I remember before the breathing tube was placed was simply sitting by her side and telling her what was going to happen. And what we could and couldn't do to help,\" he remembers. \"She was scared about how little control she had or even the doctors had in how she did.\"\n\nLorenzoni transferred her to an ICU, an operating room that had been converted. His shift was ending, and he signed out his other patients, but he stayed on to be with this one during the intubation.\n\n\"When her body didn't respond well to that, because it was so weak, I was there doing chest compressions on her,\" he says. \"And I signed her death certificate afterwards. It was a tough day.\"\n\nShe was the first of his patients to die.\n\n\"Although she passed away without her family by her side, she wasn't alone,\" he says. \"I hope that even this small amount of company that she had at the end was comforting for her. And it's going to be one of the things that sticks with me for the rest of my career.\"\n\nMany of the people who have died from COVID-19 in New York had underlying health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, and that's true in Lorenzoni's experience as well. But he says conditions that put someone at a higher risk are much more common than people realize.\n\n\"These are people that we know. These are people that we're related to,\" he says. \"It's either yourself, or your neighbor, or people that you work with.\"\n\nHospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been decreasing for a few weeks now in New York, and Lorenzoni is back on pediatrics. It's a welcome relief for now, but he says if there's another surge, he could be called back.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1291,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/todaysdebate\/2020\/05\/18\/coronavirus-immunizing-all-companies-lawsuits-problematic-editorials-debates\/5215315002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Bruce Stern']","title":"Immunizing all companies from coronavirus lawsuits would hurt both workers, consumers","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/18\/USAT\/2bc6cee0-1391-4bb3-8229-5a2bda44e717-AP_Virus_Outbreak_Texas_Daily_Life.JPG?crop=4463,2510,x1,y454&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"Sally Greenberg\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWe are all adapting to the new normal of navigating COVID-19, with innovative approaches emerging. But not all are good ideas. A case in point is the Republican leadership\u2019s proposals to immunize businesses from accountability if they follow \u201cgovernment guidelines\u201d for operating \u201csafely.\u201d They make it sound reasonable, but when you take a closer look, the proposals would actually jeopardize both workers and consumers and damage our economic recovery.\n\nMany companies are doing their best to address COVID-19 by keeping their workers and customers safe and offering paid leave to employees who show symptoms. But immunizing all companies based on compliance with guidelines is problematic.\n\nFirst, no authoritative guidelines exist. The Trump administration recently blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s detailed reopening guidelines for certain industries because they were overly prescriptive, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe only other federal guidelines, from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offer \"recommendations\u201d rather than actual rules. Similarly, some states have created their own guidelines, but they vary greatly.\n\nWe know that certain industries have failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the public and their workforce. What standards will they be held to? Even if such guidelines existed, accountability should never be based solely on compliance with standards. In fact, under current law, compliance with government standards is already a defense from liability; if the standards are sound and a business has complied, companies face no liability. However, all the facts must be considered, including whether the standards are sufficient and applicable to the particular situation.\n\nOUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines\n\nAmerican Association for Justice:Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce, which is supporting immunity, recently wrote that a \u201cone-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly why the flexibility that exists in current rules works \u2014 to determine whether a business acted reasonably toward consumers and workers. Congress shouldn\u2019t add another layer of broad immunity based on phantom guidelines and politicians\u2019 whims.\n\nSally Greenberg is the executive director of the National Consumers League.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1295,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/health\/2020\/05\/18\/coronavirus-survivors-fears-states-reopen-economies-trump\/5194124002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Rick Jervis', 'Kameel Stanley']","title":"After enduring ventilators, body aches, fever, coronavirus survivors say states shouldn't be reopening","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/15\/USAT\/0cd1f56d-7af4-4f9f-b098-f77b90ae1f32-Omar.JPG?crop=1511,850,x0,y201&width=1511&height=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 Ron Wilkins endured 37 days on a ventilator, a failed kidney, medical paralysis and a mountain of medical bills.\n\nAs he slowly recovers from a near-death bout of COVID-19, the disease brought on by the coronavirus, at an acute care hospital near San Antonio, Wilkins and his loved ones face a new worry: states pushing to reopen stores and economies.\n\n\"People don\u2019t really understand how serious this is until they know somebody who's going through it,\" said Rebecca Patterson, Wilkins' longtime girlfriend. \"It's only a matter of time before everyone in the country knows someone.\"\n\nShe added, \"I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I don\u2019t think hurrying to open things up is it.\"\n\nThousands of coronavirus survivors are returning home after long, harrowing hospital stays to face lingering symptoms, job losses, staggering medical bills and stigma attached to surviving the virus that has infected roughly 1.5 million people in the USA and killed nearly 90,000.\n\nCoronavirus may last 2 years, study warns: And its second wave could be worse\n\nMany worry that states rushing to rescind stay-at-home orders and allow businesses to reopen will unleash a new wave of infections.\n\nThe debate over how fast states should reignite their economies flared last week when Dr. Rick Bright, a government immunologist, told a congressional committee that the window is closing fast to prevent the \u201cdarkest winter in modern history\u201d if the nation doesn\u2019t improve its response to the coronavirus.\n\nBright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his federal post in retaliation for his views. President Donald Trump called Bright an \"angry, disgruntled employee\" and has continued pushing states to reopen and rekindle the struggling economy.\n\nLeaders in some states, including Wisconsin and Texas, advocated for the reopening of small businesses with the same guidelines as essential services, such as supermarkets, even as their COVID-19 cases mount.\n\nLast week, the Wisconsin Supreme Court eliminated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order, prompting patrons to stream into bars and restaurants across the state.\n\n\"Do we need statewide rules for the run-of-the-mill opening of restaurants or small retailers? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d state Rep. Joan Ballweg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDashauna Ballard, 28, an educator from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said state officials would slow the pace of reopenings if they'd been through a COVID-19 scare. Ballard tested positive for the disease in early April after experiencing body aches, fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. She drove herself to a hospital and spent eight hours in the intensive care unit as doctors debated putting her on a ventilator.\n\nHer breathing improved the next day, and she was released. Her job working with at-risk high school students was suspended, and school officials were wary of letting her return to campus to collect her personal items after learning she had contracted the virus, she said. Some friends have been reluctant to meet with her after discovering she had COVID-19.\n\nDespite the stigma and uncertain economic future, Ballard said she's glad to be feeling better and recovering at her mother's home in Selma. She's worried states will reopen too soon.\n\n\"You are just potentially making the problem worse,\" Ballard said. \"It's not something you'll want to go through. ... You don\u2019t want to feel that feeling of your breath taken away when you bend down to tie your shoes. You don't want to go through that, no matter what age you are.\"\n\nDr. Omar Maniya, an emergency medicine resident at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, has seen both sides of the pandemic. Working in the hospital's emergency department, he's treated almost 200 COVID-19 patients, seen them struggling to breathe and had scores of them die on his shift.\n\nOne day in early March, Maniya woke up with chills, body aches and a fever that spiked to 102. As was the protocol at the time, he stayed home for a week, until his symptoms passed, then returned to work. He tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign that he probably had the disease.\n\nManiya said he's worried that as states reopen, they'll experience the surge that hit New York, which leads the nation in confirmed cases (350,000) and deaths (28,000).\n\n\"I fear that many people around the country not experiencing this in their state are rolling their eyes thinking, 'It's not going to happen here,' \" Maniya said. \"A majority of states still have rising cases every day. I don\u2019t think this is, by any means, under control.\"\n\nVirginia Bennett, 77, is an active grandmother of four. She shuttled between her home in Indiana and her winter home in Naples, Florida, and took line dancing classes five days a week.\n\nIn mid-March, she felt suddenly ill in Naples and went to a hospital. X-rays showed her lungs ravaged by the virus. Doctors moved her to an ICU and placed her on a ventilator immediately, where she spent the next 36 days. Family members had no access to her, relying on twice-a-day phone updates from doctors and nurses.\n\nSlowly, in early May, she began to improve and was released from the hospital May 8. Masked doctors, nurses and technicians applauded as Bennett was wheeled out of the hospital to the sounds of the Beatles' \"Here Comes the Sun\" playing on the hospital PA system.\n\nBennett was transferred to another critical care hospital, where she would begin her long recovery from the disease, daughter Jennifer Grytza said. Doctors said Bennett might be at her new hospital for several more months.\n\nBefore COVID-19 nearly took her mom's life, Grytza, a sales manager at a hotel chain who lost her job early in the pandemic, said she believed states should reopen as soon as possible. Now, she's not so sure.\n\n\"I know people need to get back to work,\" she said. \"I want to say, 'Let's reopen, but do it with caution and sensitivity to your neighbors and friends.' \"\n\nAlice Police, a Westchester, New York, breast cancer surgeon, thought she could ride out the virus at home in late March when she was hit with flu-like symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. As her condition worsened, she was admitted to a hospital in early April.\n\nDoctors discovered Police was experiencing what's known as a \"cytokine storm,\" in which the body releases a surge of immune responses to combat a virus, a condition that could turn deadly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a thunderstorm for the body,\u201d Police, 66, said. \"It\u2019s where the body is basically willing to kill you to kill the virus.\u201d\n\nPolice was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was never intubated but struggled to breathe. She suffered from anxiety attacks, especially at night. After a few days, her condition improved, and five days later, she was released from the hospital. Later, symptoms reemerged, and Police returned to the hospital for a plasma infusion.\n\nRecovering at home, she said she feels the country and its leaders are not taking the contagion seriously enough.\n\n\u201cThis push to reopen is very, very wrong and short-sighted,\u201d Police said. \u201cThe second wave could be worse.\u201d\n\nAs the coronavirus began its explosive spread across New York City in March, Wilkins, 62, a well-known trombonist in New York, chose to ride out the pandemic with his mother and relatives in his hometown of San Antonio. In late March, he complained of congestion and fatigue but thought it was allergies flaring up.\n\nOn April 4, he texted Patterson, his longtime girlfriend, to tell her he felt \"much better.\" Two hours later, Wilkins was rushed to the hospital, unresponsive, and immediately placed on a ventilator.\n\n\"It just escalated so quickly,\" Patterson said.\n\nFor the next 30 days, Wilkins was heavily sedated and struggling to breathe. The recipient of a kidney transplant six years ago, his only working kidney failed, and he had to be placed on dialysis. His white blood cell count shot up, and his blood pressure plummeted. He received a tracheotomy to make it easier for air to enter his lungs.\n\nDoctors called Patterson to tell her Wilkins might not make it through the day. She rushed to the hospital and spoke to him from the nurse's station via a walkie talkie that a nurse held up to Wilkin's ear in his room.\n\n\"Hang in there,\" Patterson told him. \"I know it's not your time, and we'll be hanging out again soon.\"\n\nSlowly, in early May, his condition began to improve. He was able to breathe on his own and was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital in nearby New Braunfels. Thursday, he took his first bite of solid food in over a month.\n\nPatterson said she doesn't know how soon Wilkins can return to his music career or whether there will be much of an industry left when he does. Wilkins, an Air Force veteran, has health insurance underthe Department of Veterans Affairs,but Patterson suspects it won't cover most of his medical bills, which she expects will be staggering. She started a GoFundMe.com site and personal website to try to raise money to cover his medical expenses.\n\nPatterson relishes Wilkins' small victories, such as forming a few words using a Passy-Muir speaking valve and regaining the use of his fingers.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how old you are,\" she said. \"It's a serious disease with long-term effects.\"\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1296,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-mast-burning\/","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Samanth Subramanian']","title":"In Europe, they\u2019re burning witches again","image":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/GettyImages-1210209676-1200x628.jpg","body_text":"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done.

Many firms say they won\u2019t survive unless they are bailed out immediately.\n\nThe government said on Sunday it would privatize state-run companies in non-strategic sectors and stop fresh insolvency cases for a year.\n\nBut apart from that its plans entail a mix of easy loan schemes, a bit more money for a rural job-guarantee program, and a slew of long-awaited policy reforms across sectors that will take effect over the medium-term.\n\nCombined, this is not enough of a boost to prevent a likely 5% contraction in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy in fiscal 2020\/2021, Goldman Sachs said on Monday.

Only 1% of GDP is given to compensate for the income loss, which is not likely to be sufficient, \u201c said Sunil Tirumalai of brokerage Emkay Global.\n\nOne percent of GDP would amount to about $29 billion - and the government may well spend even less than that as it fears a sovereign rating downgrade.\n\nGOVT \u2018HAS LIMITED RESOURCES\u2019\n\nTwo government officials said the government estimates total spending of $27 billion from the budget this year towards the rescue measures, which would prevent the fiscal deficit from widening more than 100 basis points beyond the target of 3.5% of GDP.\n\nThe finance ministry must also assess the scale of intervention required if the coronavirus pandemic drags on for longer than currently expected, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe do not know how the situation would evolve or how long it will go on for. We need to prepare for that as well, as the government has limited resources and needs to spend wisely,\u201d said one of the officials, who did not want to be named.\n\nDistress is mounting across the economy. Emkay estimated the cost of the lockdown at around $170 billion overall.\n\nIndian airlines are taking an average daily loss of $10 million-$12 million and will need extra funding of 325 billion-350 billion rupees ($4.3 billion-$4.6 billion) in the next two years, according to ratings agency ICRA, a unit of Moody\u2019s.\n\nAirlines have been cutting staff and wages to avoid defaulting on debts to their lessors or banks, even as their fixed costs such as servicing and parking fees keep mounting.\n\nThe government has also provided no support to the tourism industry, which is likely to see tens of thousands of job cuts and small firms going bankrupt, the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality said.\n\nAnd a fifth of the 70 million retail traders who form the bedrock of Modi\u2019s political support may go under because they are unable to pay wages and rent.\n\nWith the lockdown now extended to the end of May, only one thing seems certain: The road back to economic health is going to be long and hard.\n\n\u201cA steep fall in output this year is certain. And we continue to believe that the recovery will be slow,\u201d said Shilan Shah from research firm Capital Economics.\n\n($1 = 75.7770 Indian rupees)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"UK","reliability":1},{"news_id":1302,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2020\/05\/18\/jcpenney-store-closures-2020-bankruptcy-coronavirus\/5214439002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-18","author":"['Kelly Tyko']","title":"J.C.

That number was only four fewer than the number of new cases added in San Mateo County (69), which issued its first update since Saturday.\n\nOverall, Alameda County has confirmed 2,457 cases of the coronavirus during the pandemic, and it has averaged 51 new cases a day over the past week. It was the fourth time in May that health officials there have confirmed at least 60 new cases in a day.\n\nOakland, which has confirmed 819 cases and is averaging 187 cases per 100,000 people, is the county\u2019s biggest trouble spot. Hayward is another one, with 495 cases and 307 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nOn Monday, Santa Clara County added 19 new cases, bringing its total to 2,470, still the most in the 10-county region.

We now know the model was so highly flawed it never should have been relied upon for policy decisions to begin with.\n\nEpidemiology\u2014the study of the incidence, prevalence, and impact of disease\u2014frequently calls upon models to forecast potential outcomes of diseases. Not surprisingly, once COVID-19 became a pandemic, policy experts from all across the world began relying on such models.\n\nLISTEN TO DR. DAYARATNA SPEAK ABOUT THIS ON HEARTLAND\u2019S PODCAST\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Imperial College researchers ran one such model they had used in prior research and forecast a number of potential outcomes, including that, by October, more than 500,000 people in Great Britain and 2 million people in the U.S. would die as a result of COVID-19.\n\nThe model also predicted the United States could incur up to 1 million deaths even with \u201cenhanced social distancing\u201d guidelines, including \u201cshielding the elderly.\u201d Imperial\u2019s modeling results influenced British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to impose a nationwide lockdown and influenced the White House as well.\n\nI asked Ferguson and his colleagues for their model on multiple occasions to see how they got their numbers, but they never replied to my emails.\n\nAccording to Nature, they had been \u201cworking with Microsoft to tidy up the code and make it available.\u201d I also asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the codes it used to develop its COVID-19 forecasts, but got no response.\n\nSo, my colleague Norbert Michel and I decided to take a publicly available COVID-19 epidemiological model and forecast the prevalence and mortality of the disease under a variety of plausible scenarios.\n\nThe results varied, depending on the assumptions we made about mortality rates within hospital intensive care units, asymptomatic rates, and the specification of the R0 (pronounced R-naught) value, which measures how easily the virus spreads.\n\nWe found mortality rate predictions can be quite variable depending on the age and comorbidities of those contracting the virus.\n\nUnder varying assumptions regarding a mortality rate in intensive care units between 5% and 30%, we found that predicted mortality because of the disease could range from near 78,000 deaths to as many as 810,000 deaths in the U.S. by Aug. 1.\n\nRecent testing data indicates that the asymptomatic rate for COVID-19 is likely not trivial, and data from Iceland indicates this rate can be as high as 50%. Assuming an asymptomatic rate ranging from 15% to 55%, one can project deaths in the U.S. of between 118,000 and 394,000 by Aug. 1.\n\nLastly, we looked at the model\u2019s assumption about the virus\u2019 basic reproductive number, the aforementioned R0 value. Popularized in the 2011 movie \u201cContagion,\u201d the R0 value quantifies the average number of people who will get the virus from someone who is an infected.\n\nUnder assumptions of the R0 value ranging from 1.5 to 3.5\u2014plausible estimates based on medical research as discussed in our paper\u2014the model predicted from 44,000 dead to 1.1 million dead by Aug. 1 in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, we are currently over 83,000 deaths, which exceeds our lower-end estimates. But the point our research made is that these types of models produce many plausible scenarios, depending on reasonable assumptions.\n\nAs we learn more about the new coronavirus, it is imperative to continue to update the assumptions used in these models.\n\nAfter we had published our work, news surfaced that Microsoft had actually made some headway in making the Imperial College team\u2019s model available. But the codes it released are a highly modified version of what the Imperial team actually used.\n\nAnd, it turns out, the model has serious flaws, which a former software engineer from Google discusses at length in his blog.\n\nThe Imperial College code provides different answers using the same inputs. In particular, the same assumptions can provide results that differ by 80,000 deaths over a span of 80 days. The software engineer has noted there are apparently myriad other problems as well\u2014including undocumented codes and numerous bugs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time bad models have made their way into policy. As we discussed in our work, statistical models can be useful tools for guiding policy, but they are only as credible as the assumptions on which they are based.\n\nIt is fundamentally important for models used in policy to be made publicly available, have assumptions clearly stated, and have their robustness to changes to these assumptions tested. Models also need to be updated as time goes on in line with the best available evidence.\n\nBottom line: The Imperial College model didn\u2019t meet any of these criteria. And sadly, its model was one of the inputs relied on as the basis for locking down two countries.\n\nThe codes we used at The Heritage Foundation are available here. Our assumptions are clearly stated in our paper here.","news_guard_score":"","mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1381,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/radio_the_critical_hour\/202005191079358755-trump-threatens-to-withdraw-from-who-is-profit-from-covid-19-really-the-reason\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Wilmer Leon']","title":"Trump Threatens to Withdraw From WHO: Is Profit From COVID-19 Really the Reason?","image":"https:\/\/cdn1.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107839\/95\/1078399546.jpg","body_text":"Trump Threatens to Withdraw From WHO: Is Profit From COVID-19 Really the Reason?\n\nOn this episode of The Critical Hour Dr. Wilmer Leon is joined by Niko House, political activist, broadcast journalist and founder and CEO of the MCSC Network.\n\n\"President Donald Trump on Monday sent a four-page letter to Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, threatening to permanently freeze US funding to the United Nations agency in the midst of a global pandemic that has made international cooperation as crucial as ever,\" Common Dreams reported Tuesday.

Uncertainty, stress and anxiety are running high.\n\nA recent Common Sense Media and Survey Monkey report found that 61% of teens surveyed reported feeling worried about themselves (or someone in their family) getting sick; 63% reported feeling worried about their family\u2019s ability to make a living; and 42% reported feeling more lonely than usual.\n\nMany parents have lost work and are struggling to provide for their families\u2019 basic needs. Other parents are attempting to work full-time while also caring for their children and overseeing their remote learning. We are grieving the loss of the lives we once knew.\n\nFor students, not being able to see friends, participate in regularly scheduled activities or engage in their normal routines is incredibly disruptive. And we, as parents, are learning just how hard it is to get our kids to focus when they\u2019re emotionally distant or distracted \u2014 a task even more difficult for educators.\n\nWith schools across the country closed, districts acknowledge that student learning capacity is taking a hit. While we\u2019re more forgiving about the number of academic hours logged, school districts can step up in other ways now and when we prepare to return: by supporting students\u2019 social and emotional wellness.\n\nStudents need social and emotional support, and this cannot just be the job of therapists and mental health professionals, especially when schools already face a shortage of psychologists and counselors. The current 430-to-1 ratio of students to counselors in the U.S. falls far short of the American School Counselor Association recommendation of 250-to-1.\n\nShare your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments.\n\nTeachers, whether they\u2019re working in buildings or remotely, may interact with their students more regularly than anyone else. They need the tools to be able to proactively check in with students\u2019 feelings and practice social emotional skills that will help students cope through the pandemic and beyond.\n\nBeginning classes with a quick check in can go a long way. Asking students to share how they are feeling, a challenge they are facing, or a hope they have for the week can help educators gauge what burdens students are carrying. Every student might not have the words or vocabulary, so using facial expressions or creative modes such as drawing or poetry can bridge the gap. Guiding these conversations can feel tricky and maybe even uncomfortable at first, which is why teachers need a structured framework.\n\nSome people argue that these skills should be practiced in the home, and not in the school. But we\u2019re now in a position where school is in the home. We have a huge opportunity to distribute virtual social and emotional learning tools across the country to support our students, teachers and school communities through this pandemic and beyond.\n\nStress affects ability to learn\n\nThe fact is, our children\u2019s stressors and their inability to properly manage their emotions prevent them from being effective learners. Much like you wouldn\u2019t expect to run a marathon without fueling your body, we cannot expect students to learn without strengthening their minds and their hearts. With studies that show extreme stress can disrupt the architecture of a growing brain, grades don\u2019t matter so much now.\n\nWith the emphasis on remote instruction and thinking through what school will look like when we return to \u201cnormal,\u201d I urge districts and policy makers to invest in the healing and rebuilding of our whole selves that\u2019s required for us to function at the highest level.\n\nTo do this right, we need to teach skills such as emotional identification, expression and management alongside foundational relationship skills and problem-solving strategies. When we provide this foundation for all students, we cultivate a more supportive learning environment and can better understand which students need additional support.\n\nHelp students process emotions\n\nCOVID-19 will leave a lasting mark. We\u2019re going to need support to heal and grow in its aftermath. While states are re-opening and discussing how to eventually go back to school, most of the focus is on physical safety \u2014 masks, temperature checks, extra hand sanitizer, maintaining distancing. But how will your first-grader feel when they can no longer see the smile behind their teacher\u2019s mask, exchange a high five to celebrate a job well done, or receive a hug when they seek a moment of comfort? How will they learn if they\u2019re afraid?\n\nSocial emotional learning supports will be essential in helping students process the feelings and emotions that have surfaced as a result of living through a pandemic. Those same supports will help build a foundation for students to express themselves in healthy ways so they can learn and grow for the rest of their lives.\n\nSara Potler LaHayne is founder and CEO of Move This World, a social-emotional learning program supporting Pre K-12 students, educators and families.

Whether it\u2019s helping people find reliable information in search, working with the government on testing, building an exposure-tracking system into Android and iOS in partnership with Apple, or battling misinformation on YouTube, Google\u2019s capability \u2014 and responsibility \u2014 has never been greater.\n\nGoogle and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai recently joined The Vergecast to talk about the challenges Google faces during this time, including a shift in its core ad business and the challenges of managing the company remotely. Pichai is himself adapting to remote work; he\u2019s actively blocking out more time on his calendar to read and think, something he used to do during his commute. And he\u2019s learning to make pizza from scratch by watching YouTube videos.\n\n\u201cIt came out okay,\u201d he said.\n\nPichai also talked about Google\u2019s commitment to its hardware business, including the Pixel phone line, and how the company is continuing to try to simplify its famously complex messaging app strategy.\n\n\u201cThe irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see,\u201d said Pichai.\n\nYou can listen to the full interview below, in the podcast player of your choice, or scroll down to read a full transcript, lightly edited for clarity.\n\nNilay Patel: There\u2019s three things I really want to talk about. One, how Google is handling the pandemic. Two, how your business is being impacted. And three, I talk to every CEO about how they manage their time, and I\u2019m confident that managing a company the size of Google remotely has changed that.\n\nI want to talk about all that stuff. But there were two big stories about Google that are important [from last week]. I want to ask two questions about them right away. First, there\u2019s a big NBC piece from April Glaser suggesting that your diversity efforts have been wound down [and] that the company is not even using the word \u201cdiversity\u201d internally anymore. Is that true?\n\nSundar Pichai: Diversity is a foundational value for us. Given the scale at which we build products and the fact we do it locally for our users, we are deeply committed to having that representation in our workforce. I think we were one of the earliest companies to publish transparency reports, and we\u2019ve shared that ever since. And we just released our recent annual diversity report. We\u2019ve made modest progress in critical areas. There\u2019s a long ways to go. But it is really important.\n\nWhat we are doing in the company is constantly at our scale. We look at that first \u2014 see what works, what we can scale up better. All I can say is we probably have more resources invested in diversity now than at any point in our history as a company, in terms of the scale and the resources we put in.\n\nNP: There\u2019s part of that report, which is interesting to talk about, because we hear about it in regards to Facebook a lot, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever really asked anybody at Google about it. It\u2019s that criticism from the conservative side of the aisle is something you\u2019re more responsive to with these initiatives, with how you\u2019re running the company. Is that something you think about, in terms of who\u2019s criticizing you from where?\n\nOur diversity efforts, we don\u2019t bring any such lens to it. There are many areas where we are still, as an industry, as a company, dramatically underrepresented. So there\u2019s a long way for us to go. And we\u2019ve just not had that consideration. I think, independently, just within the company, we have definitely made efforts to make sure the company can accommodate viewpoints, and no one feels they\u2019re not part of the company, regardless of their political viewpoints, amongst other things. But that\u2019s about it. I think these are two independent things.\n\nDieter Bohn: So the other big story that hit yesterday, from the day we\u2019re recording, was over at The Information, about Mario Queiroz and Marc Levoy quietly leaving the Pixel division, and the Pixel sales numbers maybe not being super great. Is the Pixel business living up to where you hoped it would be right now?\n\nI\u2019ll comment on hardware, and then talk about Pixel, too.\n\nThe last couple of years have been a major integration phase for us because we\u2019ve combined our Google hardware efforts with Nest. We absorbed the mobile division of HTC. So it\u2019s been a lot of stitching together. And we have a wide product portfolio, too. So it\u2019s definitely been a building phase. We\u2019re super committed to it for the long run. Hardware is hard. And it definitely has components, which take real time to get it right, thinking about underlying silicon or display or camera or any of those tacks. And so we are definitely investing in it, but that timeline. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\n\n\u201cHardware is hard.\u201d\n\nPixel 3A last year was one of our highest NPS-rated products ever, and definitely even benchmarked outside. So to me, it\u2019s a clear indication we have made a lot of progress. We just launched Pixel Buds this week, which you guys covered \u2014 thank you \u2014 to a good reception. Our Nest Home Hub products are definitely doing well.\n\nWe take a long-term view. We are not in it just for phones alone. We have a vision of where computing needs to go. And I think it\u2019s really hard to drive that vision without doing hardware, software, and services together. You have to think of the intersection of it. I see a lot of value in thinking about it and doing it that way.\n\nWe are definitely going to have hiccups. We are a nascent player in a really complex space, so not everything\u2019s going to be smooth. But am I excited about our portfolio for later this year \u2014 especially if I take a longer-term view? Because some of the deeper efforts we are putting in will take three to four years to actually play out. And when they come in, I think I\u2019m excited about how they will shape where we are going.\n\nDB: Yeah. I\u2019ve asked you \u201cHow serious are you about hardware?\u201d every year since you created the division, and sort of like with self-driving cars it\u2019s, \u201cWell, it\u2019ll be a five-year timeframe, it\u2019ll be a five-year timeframe.\u201d That five-year timeframe always seems to be five years out.\n\nSo when you say you\u2019re in it for the long term, is that still the timeframe that you\u2019re thinking of for [hardware] really bringing back really serious results in terms of big sales numbers or big influence in the market or are you looking for something more immediate?\n\nNo, I mean we think about our hardware efforts obviously in the context of our overall computing efforts and in addition to what our ecosystem is doing. So we take that into account. I do think it\u2019s important we build a sustainable business, financially, too. Because I look at the level of investment hardware needs, both in terms of all the technology R&D you need to do, the kind of supply chain you need to develop, as well as the go-to-market investments you need. So it\u2019s a deep investment. So to do it well, I think you have to do it with a clear financial sustainability goal. So that\u2019s important.\n\nSo for me, three reasons. One is to drive computing forward. The second is we really guide our ecosystem. Pretty much everything we\u2019ve done well, you can go all the way back and Android\u2019s early days, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which we worked together, was a pivotal phone. Nexus 7 in the tablet world. I can point to Chromebooks \u2014 all along, we did our original hardware to kind of bootstrap it. And I look at areas maybe where we haven\u2019t done opinionated [work] \u2014 maybe [smart]watch is a good example where we haven\u2019t. And then you can see it\u2019s tough to guide an ecosystem to what your vision of it is, just building the underlying platform.\n\nSo I think that\u2019s the second reason. And third is to really build a sustainable hardware business. I think all of it is important, and that\u2019s how I think about it. And I\u2019m excited. Rick [Osterloh] and team, working closely with Hiroshi [Lockheimer] and team, they have that long-term view. So we\u2019re pretty committed to it.\n\nListen to The Vergecast, the only podcast you need to make sense of this week\u2019s tech news, hosted by Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn. Subscribe here!\n\nDB: So you\u2019re the CEO of Alphabet now, in addition to Google. How much of your time do you actually even get to devote to hardware? Are you looking at prototypes? Is it just sort of one meeting in a week? Or is it a larger part of your time?\n\nIt\u2019s just a coincidence, I think, I spent my morning with the team today talking about our portfolio for next year.\n\nDB: Anything you want to tell us?\n\nYou guys are going to figure it out anyway!\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. Rick and Hiroshi drive these efforts. But I try to spend time in a more stepped-back way on some of the bigger things they are doing over time.\n\nNP: Dieter is pointing out \u2014 he just reviewed the Galaxy... A51?\n\nDB: That\u2019s right.\n\nNP: That\u2019s a cheap phone. He gave it a seven. The reason we reviewed it\u2014\n\nI saw the intro to the video where you said, \u201cThis phone sells more than the Galaxy.\u201d I actually watched the video.\n\nDB: It actually was the top-selling phone last quarter worldwide.\n\nI think I learned it from watching your video. It was just kind of interesting. Maybe I should have known that.\n\nNP: That\u2019s the question here. When we think about your phones coming out, we think about are you competitive with the flagship Samsung devices? We think, are you competitive with the iPhones? But the bulk of the market is down there, at $399, $499. Is that where you want to be? Or do you want to go make a big flagship phone and take share away from the top of the market?\n\nThe area where we have demonstrated the strongest value proposition, that\u2019s why I gave the [Pixel] 3A example, it\u2019s where we clearly have demonstrated it. But having said that, if you want to drive computing forward, that high end is where you\u2019re going to also keep moving the needle. And it\u2019s where we are putting a lot of our effort into.\n\nSo you will continue to see us invest in both ends of the spectrum. We care all the way \u2014 [we\u2019re] obviously working with our ecosystem [on] entry-level devices. I\u2019m deeply passionate about that. But definitely, the high end is something where we\u2019re putting in a lot of effort. That\u2019s where some of the underlying investments pay. It accumulates over time because it takes two to three years to do some of the deeper investments you need to do it really well.\n\nDB: Are you seeing \u2014 especially now with everyone at home \u2014 are you seeing big changes in consumer behavior in terms of buying hardware? Is everyone going out and buying Nest cameras? Or they feel that they don\u2019t need them because they\u2019re at home anyway? Anything changing for you there?\n\nObviously, on the software side, we have clearly seen impact in terms of usage across several of our products. Some products have been negatively affected, too. But we can clearly measure it. Hardware is a bit more complex because it\u2019s really gated by the supply chain, [which] got affected for different products in different ways, and demand has definitely been affected, too. Some of it is to do with lack of retail working well and all that stuff. So I think it is tough to exactly forecast what demand will come back. So for me, it\u2019s too early to tell.\n\nNP: Let\u2019s skip into the broader business of Google and how it\u2019s going. Dieter had the question about consumer behavior. I just had this guess, so I\u2019m going to ask you: is Maps usage way down?\n\nYeah, totally. [Laughs] You alone not using it is probably contributing. No, I\u2019m just kidding.\n\nNP: I\u2019m always using it.\n\nNo, it did have a significant \u2014 obviously, as people aren\u2019t driving around, you clearly saw an impact. Interesting to me, was maybe over the last two to three weeks, we definitely see users coming back to it looking for local information. So definitely we see activity back around people trying to find services, what\u2019s around, what\u2019s open. People are exploring and discovering local services again. So there\u2019s this clear inflection, but not clear what that fully means. But that\u2019s where it is.\n\nNP: And then in your broader business \u2014 obviously Google makes the bulk of its revenue in advertising. We have felt the effects of the advertising market changing. The whole world has felt the effects of the advertising market changing. How are you seeing those effects at Google? What are you doing to manage against them?\n\nI spoke about it in the earnings call. Compared to January and February, we clearly saw the impact in March. So for sure, Google is not immune to the global economy. In some ways, it\u2019s representative across all sectors. So clearly, as entire sectors have been affected \u2014 travel being a particularly severe example of it \u2014 we have definitely felt that across the board.\n\n\u201cGoogle is not immune to the global economy.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting for us is, historically, compared to past cycles, search is something that is very highly ROI-driven, performance-oriented. And so advertisers adapt. They pull back quickly. We see demand shifts and people capitalizing on it. You will see activity in \u201coffice furniture\u201d instantly, right then. So you can kind of see the economy adapt in real time. And so it\u2019s fascinating to see it that way. But for sure, it\u2019s definitely impacted our business.\n\nDB: In your earnings call, you hinted that this wasn\u2019t going to turn around right away next quarter. We\u2019re in for a tough time for a while. But coming out of this in however long it takes, do you think that the ad market is going to look substantially similar to what it looked like a year ago? Or are you thinking that things are going to fundamentally change in your ad business, or in your business generally, in a way that you\u2019re able to look at now? Or is it just way too early to tell? It\u2019s too hard to forecast?\n\nIt\u2019s the question, which is on a lot of our minds: What are the trends you are seeing which have reverted back to the mean? And what is it that is here to stay? Well, will travel ever return to what it was before? And so on.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously tough to predict with the nature of the virus, how long it\u2019ll be. We generally assume the effects will be there for a while. I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. As a company, we assume that it\u2019s going to take a while to recover, and [we\u2019re] planning for it that way. But it\u2019s a bit hard for me to say.\n\nHuman needs are pretty fundamental, I think, in terms of being social, wanting to meet people. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to be back in a... I wish I could go watch a football game or something.\n\nWould I like to go to a music concert? The answer is yes. So I think the innate human need is there. But I think it\u2019ll be a while before we get back to it. So I expect it to be kind of a slow, steady recovery.\n\nNP: How are you thinking about the general push to reopen? At Google, you said people are going to work from home through 2020. What are you thinking about for Google? And then broadly, how are you thinking about this push to reopen, particularly in the United States?\n\nEarly on, I felt we were one of the first to go to work from home, partly because I think it made sense for the health and safety of our employees. I felt that, given a lot of our work could be done from home, it made sense for us to contribute to social distancing. Clearly, the needs vary widely across different groups. We talked about hardware earlier \u2014 definitely having access to testing equipment, labs, it\u2019s really important. You can\u2019t test whether something works in 5G unless you can actually be in that testing environment.\n\nSo it varies widely across teams. And we are going to be conservative on the return back for the broad company. When the local ordinance allows, I think we\u2019ll probably start with trying to get 10 to 15 percent of the company back, prioritizing people who actually kind of need to be there. And that way, we can really have a de-densified environment and have a lot of safety procedures in place. And just because we are talking about 10 to 15 percent capacity doesn\u2019t mean that many people \u2014 we can rotate and actually get more people in once or twice a week.\n\n\u201cA vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year.\u201d\n\nAnd you have people in two different buckets. There are people who really want to come back, and they miss it. Especially at Google, for 20 years, we have genuinely invested in our physical spaces and the culture it creates with a view to having people work well together. And so I think there are people who miss that part of the experience, depending on what your personal situation is. And then there are people on the other side of the spectrum who want to be conservative. So we are trying to make that play out.\n\nBut I expect by the end of the year, we\u2019ll be at 20 to 30 percent capacity. Which may still mean we are able to get 60 percent of our employees in once a week, or something like that. And so that\u2019s what we mean, where a vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year. But it\u2019s a very fluid situation. If things, of course, look better, we will adapt to it. We want to be flexible. Trying to really understand what works, what doesn\u2019t work in this.\n\nDB: Are you thinking longer term in terms of the number of people that might work from home or work remotely? Twitter just announced forever. You can work from home for as long as you want. Are you thinking in that way, too? Or are you going to wait and see how things play out?\n\nI want to be driven by data here, and so I view it as a research phase, and [we\u2019ll] see where the data leads us. In some ways, I\u2019m glad Twitter is running a kind of one-end-of-the-spectrum experiment. So thanks, Jack. It\u2019s good to see that end of the spectrum.\n\nProductivity is down in certain parts, and what is not clear to me is \u2014 in the first two months, most of the people are already on projects in which they kind of know what they need to do. But the next phase, which will kick in is, let\u2019s say you\u2019re designing next year\u2019s products, and you\u2019re in a brainstorming phase, and things are more unstructured. How does that collaboration actually work? That\u2019s a bit hard to understand and do. So we are trying to understand what works well and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019re probably going to be conservative in it. We want to make sure things work well. But coming out of it all, do we all learn and have more flexibility in how we think about this? I think so, yeah. That\u2019s how I would bet.\n\nNP: I\u2019m going to take this moment to somehow transition and ask you about messaging strategy. I\u2019m going to figure it out. You just come with me as we do it.\n\n[Laughs] How can I do a Verge podcast without thinking about our\u2014\n\nDB: Pop quiz, hotshot. Name all the products.\n\nOur entire complexity in messaging is to make sure Verge has plenty of material to work with.\n\nNP: Google has historically been good at dogfooding and using its own products. Obviously, this is a moment to use these products in a way that maybe had never been stressed before. You added gallery view to Meet. That seems like a button that should have been there, and suddenly everybody realized it\u2019s not there, and snap, it\u2019s there.\n\nBut there are some bigger competitors. There\u2019s more consumer-focused companies that are succeeding, like Zoom. Is this a moment of clarity for you? To say, \u201cWe actually have to win this. We know what we need to do because we\u2019re using our own products as much as we are.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an important moment. We brought Javier [Soltero] in a few months ago, before all this, with a clear view. So we had a clear sense of where we wanted to go, so some of the efforts were clearly underway, and in some ways, when COVID hit, we weren\u2019t fully done with all the changes we had wanted to make.\n\nI think the irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see. Javier has a very, very long commute, and one of his biggest concerns was the commute when he was joining. He\u2019s doing it all virtually now. But it is an important moment. Many schools, many organizations already use Google Meet. So we are doubling down.\n\n\u201cRCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people.\u201d\n\nObviously, COVID has blurred the lines between consumer and enterprise, and people are using products in all kinds of contexts. And so definitely, we are using it as an opportunity to make Google Meet and Google Chat, scale it up and make it more available.\n\nAnd obviously, we are a service provider [but] we are a platform, too. Hence RCS and all the work we are doing. RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people. So it\u2019s making better progress than it appears because you\u2019re collecting so many people together on it. As people sign up, you will see more and more momentum.\n\nSo all of that is coming together well, I think. I\u2019m glad we realigned it, everything with Javier. He works both with our cloud team with Thomas [Kurian], and our platforms team with Hiroshi. And so I think we\u2019ll get to the right place. I\u2019m very excited.\n\nDB: You brought up RCS. You know I\u2019m going to ask. What are the\u2014\n\nThis is a rare moment where I am like... because I know Dieter wants to talk about it. So I had to go there.\n\nDB: In an age when Facebook is saying, \u201cWe are going to integrate all of our messaging products, and we\u2019re going to put everything under full end-to-end encryption,\u201d do you think that Google having multiple products in multiple contexts is still the way to go? Or do you think there needs to be more integration there?\n\nWe definitely want to have a more integrated, simplified view, but in all scenarios, I see our platform offering. Android is open as part of the open platform stack. I think you need an open standard messaging framework. And we have to evolve that from its SMS days, and that\u2019s RCS for me.\n\nAnd obviously, we\u2019ll continue doing that in all scenarios because I think that\u2019s part of building that open stack. I don\u2019t see that changing. But in terms of our services, I want it to be as simplified for people as possible. And I think we\u2019ve made great strides compared to where we were with Google Meet and Chat. Of course, we have Duo. We intended Duo for consumers and Google Meet and Chat for businesses, effectively. But the lines have blurred. And they share a lot of common underlying technology. They\u2019re both built on WebRTC, and so there\u2019s a lot of common work, and given its common teams, hopefully we can iterate.\n\nBut some flexibility, I think it\u2019s fine here.\n\nNP: We started out by talking about phones. One of the reasons Apple\u2019s phones are so sticky is they have a great messaging product. Do you think that that is connected? You need a great sticky messaging product to move people over?\n\nLet me give a user answer and a technical answer, too.\n\nFrom a user standpoint, any Android phone you get, you always want a phone number-based messaging product, which you\u2019re going to create, and you want something which comes with the platform, and we\u2019re trying to align that. And that integration, I think is critical. And so I do feel it\u2019s an important part and where Android has been behind. So I think it\u2019s important there.\n\nTechnically, different OEMs and different carriers having different RCS implementations was one of the biggest causes of fragmentation in Android. It caused real pain. So simplifying that is a tremendous multiplier in terms of productivity and efficiency and simplicity. And so for both reasons, I think, it\u2019s important to invest, and get it right.\n\nNP: So we lured you here by saying we were going to talk about the pandemic. We\u2019ve mostly talked about messaging. I want to make sure we talk about the pandemic.\n\n[Laughs] What a surprise.\n\nNP: I feel like your team prepped you well. You had to know this question was coming. I keep track every week of when Trump and his team held up the flowchart and said, \u201cSome x thousand Google engineers are working on it.\u201d\n\nJust walk me through that day. Did you expect that to come? The next day, Trump said someone from Google had called and apologized to him. Did that happen? Just what was that set of days like?\n\nVery early on through COVID, we decided as a company we should do everything [in] areas where our expertise could help. And so we had a wide set of efforts.\n\nI think there were two efforts, and we were in touch with the [White House] coronavirus task force. And there were two efforts, both in terms of what Google can do to provide more information, and Verily was working on a way to develop wide-scale testing, particularly with an emphasis on drive-through testing, with a focus on first responders. And we were in touch on both efforts. And so that\u2019s what it was.\n\nToday, I think Verily right now is in 86 sites across 13 states. And that\u2019s what that effort was. It\u2019s obviously taken more time than most of us expected to get there, but there were real constraints along the way. But I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. My view on this is, at a time of global pandemic, we want to do everything we can to help the US government succeed. And so we\u2019re trying to play our role in it.\n\nNP: I\u2019m just going to ask you directly: did you call President Trump and apologize?\n\nMy discussions were with the task force, so that\u2019s who I was talking to.\n\nNP: It\u2019s quite a quote. It just struck me at that time that the distinction between Google and Verily was not being well-made. And so I think my follow-up here is: is that clearer now? You\u2019re the CEO of Alphabet. Verily is under Alphabet. You\u2019re also the head of Google.\n\nI think we were communicating across two areas. We were communicating both. I do feel like the onus is on us as a company to clarify and be clear in terms of how we are communicating. I don\u2019t think we got everything right in terms of communicating across the two groups, which were talking back and forth. So I just wanted to make sure we were clear in terms of how we were communicating.\n\nNP: So what now is the relationship between Verily and Google? Do you still have volunteers working at the Verily project?\n\nYes. Because they\u2019re both under Alphabet, we view it as areas where we help. So sometimes Google is doing work on health care, Verily is doing health care. If we share resources where we need to, sometimes there could be an AI breakthrough from Google, which is what Verily uses to commercialize. But at a technical level, we can exchange ideas. At a regulatory level, we work together to have a compliance process, and all that framework we built in. But I\u2019m excited at the progress Verily is making as well.\n\nDB: Do you find that separation, as sort of two separate companies under one umbrella, it\u2019s still useful? Or has your thinking changed about the distinction between Alphabet company Verily and Alphabet company Google?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. There are many areas where I find the distinction to actually help because when you take something like Waymo, and the timeframe it needs to operate in, [it\u2019s] dealing with a very different set of issues than building a typical internet product. I like the fact that there\u2019s structural separation, that the Google management team doesn\u2019t have to sit and think through that breadth, and they can be more focused. And it allows us to play these different bets with the different characteristics they would need and different time horizons and so on.\n\nSo Alphabet creates that flexibility. The underlying commonality across all of Alphabet is we think [there] has to be a deeper technology play \u2014 something based on some foundational technology to solve something. That\u2019s the underlying commonality.\n\nGoogle is broadly focused on the internet space, and you know if [a problem] is distinctly different from that, and allows us to still apply the technology \u2014 maybe share common things like AI and our data centers but have the right structure, right incentives, right approach to go tackle that problem. And so I think it\u2019s been really helpful to have that flexibility. I would expect sometimes we may look at something and say, \u201cHey, it\u2019s in Google. Maybe it makes sense to be more in Alphabet\u201d or vice versa. We created that structure to create that flexibility. Nest is a good example. It made more sense that it\u2019s aligned closer with the hardware team, and obviously, there\u2019s convergence there.\n\nNP: So there\u2019s a couple big health initiatives inside the Alphabet umbrella. Verily is one of them. This is a moment, I think, for biotech, for health sciences. Would you say Verily is entirely now focused on COVID and the pandemic? Or is it one of many things it\u2019s doing?\n\nIt\u2019s one of many things. There are a lot of folks there who are doctors and health care people. Obviously, by calling, they feel motivated to help at a moment like that. So there is a lot of focus. But they\u2019re focused on areas like diabetes, a longer-term disease. So they\u2019re clearly focused on other aspects of health care as well, and they will continue doing that. And so those are big doubled-up efforts already underway.\n\nNP: Google is doing a bunch of other stuff around the coronavirus and COVID-19. What are some of those other things outside of the website?\n\nIt\u2019s a big part. By now, we\u2019ve committed over a billion dollars in various ways, be it grants to public health organizations, ad credits to small \/ medium businesses, and then working in each country through the official agencies\u2019 direct loan programs to small \/ medium businesses as well. We have undertaken efforts on PPE. There\u2019s the deep work we have done on ventilators out of Rick\u2019s team. And obviously, our support for schools through products like Meet. We have provided Chromebooks. So it spans a wide variety of effort.\n\nAnd obviously, exposure notification, and the work in the contact tracing has a big effort, jointly with Apple as well.\n\nNP: Is it not often that Google and Apple collaborate at this level. How did that come about? What was your conversation with Tim Cook like? How\u2019s it going in terms of the two companies working together?\n\nIt\u2019s been a really terrific effort. It started, I think both of us saw the problem and saw the opportunity to do something, and the teams had started working on it. And at the right point, you realize in this problem, particularly to do it well, we saw some of the earlier app efforts actually struggling to work well.\n\nAnd so we realized as platform providers, we really want to make it easy, and to make it work at scale, obviously with user consent and privacy protection. And the teams started talking, they saw an opportunity to do it better, so Tim and I connected, and we talked, and we said, \u201cLet\u2019s announce it jointly.\u201d That helps clarify that we are going to approach it consistently.\n\nAnd so for public health organizations planning, we wanted to give a clear commitment and a framework that they can actually invest, and we\u2019re going to support it as a platform.\n\nThe teams talk multiple times a week across the two companies, and we are in conversations with public health organizations around the world. You will see there are large countries where they are fully developing a service on top of it. Our goal here is to have one more toolkit in all the efforts you need to manage COVID. We wanted to make sure we created the option value and add one more step in that toolkit.\n\nNP: When you\u2019re on the phone with Tim Cook, what was a problem that needed the two of you to solve or decision that needed the two of you to make?\n\nOne example I would give, when Tim and I talked, it was mainly actually deciding to just go public and lay it all out, earlier than both companies would normally do in a process like this.\n\nWe would have probably normally waited to develop, hash out more issues fully. But we both realized, given the public nature of it, given the responsible conversation you need to have with many societal institutions as part of it, it was important that we put it out and shared details, and engaged in a conversation. So we basically made that decision, I think teams had maybe different timelines on when they should be announced. And so we talked through, and we decided to announce it sooner rather than later.\n\nDB: You and I have talked previously about Google\u2019s responsibility when it comes to AI and making sure AI was ethical. With this, you\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, you\u2019re in the middle of a whole bunch of different countries with their own health organizations. How do you think about your responsibility as the CEO of Google in this pandemic? Because from a certain perspective, it rises to a governmental level of a social contract with users. Or you could say, \u201cNo, no. We\u2019re just a tech company.\u201d So how do you see that?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s a one in 100-year kind of issue we are dealing with. So it\u2019s important. I want to do everything we can [and] always be aware that we are a company, a private company, working through an extraordinarily public moment. We clearly have products, which people come and rely on, and so doing that well, both in terms of providing high-quality information and getting it right trumps everything as we handle that. And that is the biggest way by which we can do well.\n\nBeyond that, supporting our employees, supporting the communities we operate in, all that goes hand in hand. And then there are longer-term efforts where, because we have deep technological underpinnings, we can bring that technology to bear to support health care organizations and so on. But that\u2019s the way I think about it.\n\nI think it\u2019s an important moment where the big companies need to step up. But I think you need to do it in a construct in which you realize you\u2019re a private company, and you\u2019re one small part of big value chain to solve this.\n\nNP: So that\u2019s an interesting way of putting it because some of the problems you\u2019re solving are new. We\u2019re going to use the Bluetooth radios in everybody\u2019s cellphone to do exposure notification. I think, historically, that\u2019s a new idea. I don\u2019t think people had that before. It\u2019s obviously got a bunch of new problems to solve.\n\nOn the flip side, there are some very old problems to solve here. Are people getting reliable information? Can they trust their leaders? Can they trust the companies they rely on? Google obviously provides a lot of information in search. You provide a lot of information in YouTube.\n\nThere have been some massive coordinated disinformation campaigns on both of those platforms. Facebook just recently announced what amounts to a worldwide supreme court for free speech on its platform. Are you thinking you need to do something at that scale to manage the very old problems of reliable information on your platforms?\n\nIt\u2019s the foundation of what our company is built on. Search was designed across the web to surface the highest-quality information. So it\u2019s something we\u2019ve thought about for a long time. Obviously, the challenges have gotten more complex and harder, for sure. And so we have evolved our approaches, too.\n\nI\u2019m following what everybody is doing with a lot of interest here. So for example, in YouTube, over the past maybe four years, we have definitely, for categories of information, relied on external experts. On violent extremism, we partner with counter-extremism organizations. So we tap their expertise to help shape our policies. And as we evolved our hate and harassment policies last year, we consulted many organizations. We took inputs.\n\nSo I think relying on deep experts, other nonprofit institutions, governmental expertise, is a natural way we want to approach our work. And so I think to me, whether you set up an oversight board \u2014 I will look to see what the learnings from it are, and definitely going to study that. I think it\u2019s important to understand that.\n\nI think we are going to be flexible. If we find something works, we will be really open to adopting it. But we also, I think directionally, have really worked hard to bring outside input in terms of policy definition and so on. So that\u2019s how we generally think about it.\n\nNP: I want to just ask about how you are managing Google. Vergecast listeners know I tend to end all these interviews by saying, \u201cHow do you manage your time?\u201d And that question, it used to have one kind of very clear set of answers. Now, it\u2019s all different. So as CEO of Google, you\u2019re obviously managing a giant company remotely. You\u2019re dealing with governments. You\u2019re dealing with your own employees. How are you currently just managing your time operating the company?\n\nI\u2019ve tried to have two parallel tracks. One is explicitly, there\u2019s a definite focus on COVID response. So I\u2019m spending a significant chunk of my time on something like that, which I wasn\u2019t spending two months ago.\n\nBut also making sure the company operationally is focused on continuing to pursue all efforts they are doing and being able to compartmentalize, and do that, too. And so I\u2019m making sure that our meetings just have a real sense of normalcy, and that\u2019s why I gave the example of the earlier morning meeting today when I was reviewing our product plan for next year. It\u2019s just a normal meeting, which I would have done. And so being able to do\u2014\n\nNP: What surprised you in that meeting?\n\nIt is just \u2014 timelines are hard to plan around. Your disruptions are kind of concerning. So when you plan timelines \u2014 and they\u2019re for sure hard \u2014 it\u2019s not a surprise. It\u2019s what was different about the meeting.\n\nNP: I almost got you. I was this close.\n\n[Laughs] Almost. That\u2019s why I\u2019m laughing.\n\nNP: So you\u2019re having meetings on sort of a normal cadence with a sense of normalcy. What else has shifted for you in how you\u2019re managing your time?\n\nThe art of doing this, and I\u2019m actually talking to others who have worked from home before, and the line I heard was, \u201cWorking from home is as much about not working from home, too.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s been harder for IT. How do you draw the boundaries? I miss transitions giving me a chance to drive and think about stuff and process. And so on hand, it\u2019s a bit more efficient because you can move across what we are doing right now might have taken a lot more time, maybe not as a podcast.\n\n\u201cI miss that space to think quietly.\u201d\n\nBut I miss the transition. I miss that space to think quietly. And so for me, that\u2019s definitely something I need to progress better. But I\u2019m managing my time. I have a clear sense of the major areas in the company I want to spend a percentage of my time [on]. I actually look back at my calendar every three months to see whether I spent my time on the things I wanted to spend. And I\u2019ve always done that. So any aberrations that come out, I step back and think, \u201cWhat can I do structurally to make sure I get back to how I want to spend my time?\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s a constant reiterative process. And sometimes you look back in horror, and you realize you got it wrong, and then you course-correct. So that\u2019s how I think about it.\n\nNP: So the classic question I ask is \u201cWhen do you work?\u201d Because it\u2019s a question I\u2019m very focused on. It sounds like you did a lot of your time working and thinking in those transitions. How are you building that time now? Or is that something you\u2019re just working on?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m trying to force-block times on the calendar, specifically to read and think. I think it\u2019s hard to do. But actually block the time and do that.\n\nThat\u2019s how I had the time to watch your Galaxy A51 video. Sometimes just trying to understand what\u2019s going on and spend time outside. So I think carving out that thinking time is one tool I have. But drawing boundaries is something I\u2019m working on as well. Definitely picking up hobbies, which I never thought I had before. I made pizza last week from scratch, thanks to some YouTube cooking video. It turned out okay. And so things like that help.\n\nNP: As you look out over the course of this next year, over the course of the crisis unfolding, what are the leading indicators of change that you\u2019re looking at that maybe other people aren\u2019t looking at? Maybe that\u2019s specific to Google, maybe it\u2019s broader than that. But what are the signals that you see? You have access to a lot of signals. What are the signals you see that indicate change is coming, one way or the other?\n\nIt\u2019s effectively user pattern shifts, trying to understand \u2014 is telemedicine a real thing? Does it sustain? Or is it just something people do, and do people revert back to how they do things.\n\nSo looking at recovery patterns and seeing where you\u2019re actually seeing a difference, a long-run difference, is what we are trying to piece out and understand, where we can. And we\u2019re very interested in how does work culture shift? How does travel and meetings shift for the long run? And hence its impact on things which will do well because of that, and things which will have to adapt. So shifts like that.\n\nEducation is a big area where we are watching, and definitely I know you\u2019ve been passionate about rural broadband and connectivity. To me, distance learning really identifies those gaps, too. And so figuring out how through both connectivity and computing we reach those things, is a long-run journey, I think, which we\u2019re working on.\n\nBut I think trying to get those snapshots of where things are changing and trying to be data-driven and adapt is something \u2014 I do think these are moments of opportunity as well to build a future. History shows through times like this because so many people are facing so many problems, entrepreneurs rethink things and solve things. So it\u2019s definitely worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNP: Do you see it differently around the world? You have access to a lot of data from around the world. Some parts of the world are in different states of this. What are you seeing around the world that is giving you an indication that things are going to change in the long term?\n\nOne thing, which has been striking is \u2014 I don\u2019t think in our lifetimes we have seen such a global moment where everyone seems to be going through a shared experience. That\u2019s unique. So it\u2019s kind of one of the few positives. It feels like a moment for humanity together as a whole.\n\nBut for sure, when you look at places in Asia, which have gone through and come back, we do see some shifts in areas, like as people get used to ordering online, some of those effects seem \u2014 some of the shift stays. So we see trends like that. But I see a lot more common than not, which, to me, shows the commonality of humanity, more than how different we are. So there\u2019s more common patterns I see rather than differences.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1434,"url":"http:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-eu-vietnam-trade\/eu-trade-pact-to-support-vietnams-coronavirus-recovery-world-bank-idUKKBN22V1IR?il=0","publisher":"Reuters","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":[],"title":"EU trade pact to support Vietnam's coronavirus recovery - World Bank","image":"https:\/\/s1.reutersmedia.net\/resources\/r\/?m=02&d=20200519&t=2&i=1519146950&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG4I0W2","body_text":"European Union and Vietnamese flags are seen at the signing ceremony of EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement at the government office in Hanoi, Vietnam June 30, 2019.

Omer']","title":"Reform the CDC to fight the next pandemic","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/NJNXNWDABUI6VLCQDBYB4FHANU.jpg&w=1440","body_text":"The men and women at the CDC are some of the most well-trained and dedicated civil servants in the country. But even those of us who have been cheerleaders for the CDC\u2019s role in keeping the United States and the world safe recognize the need for fixing this venerable institution.\n\nIt is reasonable to ask why the CDC was unable to quickly develop and scale up testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus\u2019s official name. Why was there no backup plan? How come SARS-CoV-2 circulation in many parts of the United States remained undetected by the CDC\u2019s early warning systems for at least several weeks after January? Why did the CDC not take the lead in developing, or at least systematically collating, projection models for the pandemic\u2019s spread, which would have decreased confusion among decision-makers and the public?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to avoid asking similar questions again the next time a new virus appears, the CDC needs some changes.\n\nOver the years, there has been a substantial expansion in the types of activities the CDC is involved with. The federal agency whose original name was the Communicable Disease Center now deals with issues ranging from birth defects to injury prevention. Critics have charged that this expanded focus has resulted in dilution of the CDC\u2019s outbreak response mission. The CDC should not ignore other health issues such as obesity and noncommunicable diseases. But it cannot afford to lose focus as the nation\u2019s insurance policy against infectious disease threats.\n\nReform efforts should focus on increasing CDC\u2019s infectious disease laboratory capacity and enhancing its expertise in scaling up testing during public health emergencies. One of the most effective ways to get ahead of outbreaks is to have a highly sensitive epidemiological surveillance system. CDC maintains several surveillance systems, but they were of limited utility as early warning systems for covid-19. CDC will have to reassess the data it acquires, how fast these data get transmitted and what analytical tools it uses to detect signals. CDC will also have to modernize the types of data it routinely uses. For example, rapidly sequencing and analyzing genomes of circulating viruses can provide important information, such as where the virus was imported from. To better prepare for fast-spreading outbreaks, CDC will have to expand the use of genomic epidemiology and other modern tools for surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC also badly needs more money, and Congress has to change the way it funds the agency. Public health investments yield very high returns: For every dollar spent on prevention, there is a five times return on investment within five years. Despite this, Congress has tried to fund public health on the cheap. As a result, the CDC has been chronically underresourced. For example, CDC\u2019s Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program that supports states and local areas in their preparations for pandemics and other emergencies has had its funding shrunk from $940 million in 2002 to $675 million in 2020. PHEP funds can be used to develop laboratory and contact-tracing capacity \u2014 which could have come in handy in this pandemic.\n\nCDC\u2019s programs are micromanaged by Congress through detailed line-item budgeting, which means lawmakers and their aides have undue influence over CDC priorities. A stroll through the CDC campus can be illustrative: You arrive at the (Rep. Edward R.) Roybal campus to check in at the (Sen.) Tom Harkin communications center to walk to the (Sen.) Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center. The instinct to appease political leadership was criticized by the National Academy of Sciences during another infectious disease emergency \u2014 the smallpox bioterrorism threat in 2005. A nimble, evidence-driven CDC would require flexibility in resource allocation based on scientific acumen and experience of public health professionals, rather than ideological leanings of vested interests.\n\nThe Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), CDC\u2019s flagship training program for its staff, needs to be modernized. This postdoctoral program trains CDC scientists in epidemiologic field work through a combination of classroom training and experiential learning. Career CDC leaders usually come from this cadre of staff; it is rare for a non-EIS-trained CDC staff to rise to the senior echelons.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIS officers are trained in conventional methods for investigating and responding to outbreaks, such as fast-paced studies that compare exposures among those with illness labeled as \u201ccases\u201d and those without disease labeled as \u201ccontrols.\u201d\n\nBut the science of disease control has evolved substantially and now includes tools such as advanced mathematical modeling, genomic epidemiology and high-end laboratory methods. CDC does employ scientists with expertise in these and other emerging subfields. These skills are increasingly so seminal to modern disease control approaches, though, that they should be a major part of the core EIS training requirements. Moreover, EIS officers should be well-versed in the science of behavioral interventions \u2014 designing a smart social distancing strategy is as much about human behavior as it is about biological characteristics of the virus.\n\nJust over a year ago in a U.S. Senate committee hearing, I was asked about the value of the CDC. Without hesitation, I described the CDC as a national treasure. I continue to believe this. And it is precisely because I have such faith in the abilities of the men and women of the CDC that I know we must reform this U.S. institution of global significance. We need it to be as excellent as it can be.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1444,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/climate-environment\/2020\/05\/19\/greenhouse-emissions-coronavirus\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Chris Mooney', 'Brady Dennis', 'John Muyskens']","title":"Global emissions plunged an unprecedented 17 percent during the coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/resizer\/Jw1St2i8RUxo-6DLRo30Sof27FU=\/1484x0\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/QJFZMP46LRE7FIKOBFGGJGU2QU.jpg","body_text":"Estimated daily carbon emissions in 2020 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per day Range of uncertainty 50 0 Jan.

That includes a peak decline in daily emissions of 17 percent in early April, according to the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nations, the drop was much steeper.\n\nCarbon emissions decline by region 0% CHINA INDIA EUROPE & BRTAIN \u22125% UNITED STATES \u221210% change from 2019 daily average OTHER COUNTRIES \u221215% Jan.

March May\n\nScientists have long insisted that the world must scale back carbon pollution significantly \u2014 and quickly \u2014 to mitigate the worst effects of climate change over coming decades, although none have suggested that a deadly global pandemic is the way to do so.\n\nTuesday\u2019s study projects that total emissions for 2020 will probably fall between 4 and 7 percent compared to last year \u2014 an unheard-of drop in normal times, but considerably less dramatic than the decline during the first few months of the year when economies screeched to a halt. The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly, or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life.\n\nThe unprecedented situation produced by the coronavirus has offered a glimpse into the massive scale required to cut global emissions, year after year, to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord. Last fall, a U.N. report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 percent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\n[In bleak report, U.N. says drastic action is only way to avoid worst effects of climate change]\n\nTuesday\u2019s study underscores how far the world remains from that long-term aspiration. The forced plunge in greenhouse gas emissions in recent months, while extraordinary, returned carbon pollution levels only to those last seen in 2006. And the recent changes are unlikely to last.\n\n\u201cHistory suggests this will be a blip,\u201d said Rob Jackson, a Stanford professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus\u2019s effect by nation and economic sector. \u201cThe 2008 [financial] crisis decreased global emissions 1.5 percent for one year, and they shot back up 5 percent in 2010. It was like it never happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn aerial view shows light traffic on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles on April 15 during what would normally be the evening rush hour.

The peak 17 percent decline in global emissions \u2014 which occurred in early April \u2014 meant nations continued to generate more than 80 percent of carbon pollution.\n\nResearchers say the experience demonstrates how broad structural changes to the energy system are critical if the world is to slash emissions in a meaningful, sustainable way.\n\n\u201cWe can see now that behavior change alone is not going to do it,\u201d said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, lead author of the study and director of Britain\u2019s Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research.\n\nLe Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said she expected to find even larger reductions in the power and industrial sectors during the pandemic. Instead, she said, many sources of carbon dioxide and other pollutants have continued steadily, almost on autopilot, even as much of the world has ground to a halt.\n\nAppliances continue to run, office buildings must be maintained and some factories continue to hum.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inertia in the infrastructure, in the built environment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like many things are able to function on their own, at least for a short time.\u201d\n\nEmissions have fallen before \u2014 during world wars and economic recessions, for instance, and markedly during the Great Depression. But experts do not think the modern world has experienced a plunge so sudden and sharp as in recent months.\n\n\u201cIn absolute terms, it will be the biggest,\u201d said Glen Peters, one of the study\u2019s authors and an expert at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway. \u201cIn relative terms, you will have to go back quite some [time] to find big changes like that.\u201d\n\nMost researchers agree that emissions are all but certain to bounce back once countries reopen. Already, demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and many U.S. states begin easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than $1 at some pumps.\n\nGovernments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.\n\n\u201cWhere they put this stimulus is really critical,\u201d Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said. \u201cIt\u2019s 2020, and there\u2019s not much time to tackle climate change.\u201d\n\nSome world leaders have pledged to push for a shift toward greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nLast week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country\u2019s effort to slash its emissions remains \u201cundiminished\u201d by covid-19 and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in Parliament last week, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.\n\n\u201cInadvertently, the planet this year will [have] greatly reduced its CO2 emissions. \u2026 We need to entrench those gains,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see us going back to an era of the same type of emissions as we\u2019ve had in the past. Aviation like every other sector must keep its carbon lower.\u201d\n\n\n\nA weather balloon of Airparif, which is responsible for monitoring air quality in the Ile-de-France region, flies near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on May 7. (Joel Saget\/AFP\/Getty Images)\n\nLast month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.\n\n\u201cIt will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programs, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection,\u201d Merkel told a gathering of leaders focused on climate change.\n\nThe new research was conducted by Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, Jackson, Peters, and 10 other colleagues affiliated with the Global Carbon Project.\n\nNormally, global emissions are calculated on an annual basis; doing so more rapidly, nearly in real time, presented a scientific challenge. Tuesday\u2019s study used a combination of energy data across multiple sectors, as well as data on the strenuousness of lockdowns across 69 countries that account for 97 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, to estimate the reductions.\n\nThe results varied greatly across different sectors. Airplane emissions plunged by as much as 60 percent \u2014 but airlines represent a relatively small fraction of global emissions. Emissions from surface transportation, one of the largest sources, fell 36 percent at the peak of the shutdowns.\n\nChange in emissions by sector Surface transport Power -36% change from 2019 as of April 7 -7% 0 -5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per day -10 Jan.

I\u2019m staying at home, but the Amazon delivery vehicle is still driving around.\u201d\n\nEmissions linked to home energy use actually increased about 3 percent, not surprising during a time when people are confined to their homes, using more appliances, lighting, heating and cooling. But industrial electricity demand plummeted, leading to net electricity declines overall.\n\nAlthough some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic \u2014 more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips \u2014 individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.\n\n\u201cUnless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,\u201d he said.\n\nHausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a silver lining to covid-19 for the climate,\u201d he said, \u201cunless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1448,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2020\/05\/19\/new-political-battleground-over-coronavirus-math\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Philip Bump']","title":"The new political battleground over the coronavirus?

Seeing a gap in data on daily testing, a group of volunteers established a project to compile individual state reports. Dashboards like the one created by researchers from Johns Hopkins University became go-to destinations for information about the virus\u2019s spread. More sophisticated users tracked the reproduction number for the virus by state, a measure of its effective contagiousness. And when the Trump administration decided to encourage a scaling back of the containment measures, which had left a number of businesses closed, it established numeric benchmarks that states were supposed to meet before doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen numbers and politics overlap, though, tension often emerges. If facts are stubborn things, numbers are nearly immobile \u2014 but not irreplaceable. In recent weeks, we have seen a number of occasions when the numbers related to the coronavirus pandemic have been misrepresented, altered or made a focus of efforts at reinterpretation as the inertia of political motivation has pushed against mathematical reality.\n\nOn Monday evening, Florida Today reported that the head of the Florida Department of Health\u2019s data team claimed to have been forced from her position earlier this month. Rebekah Jones helped create a localized dashboard of coronavirus information used to track the spread of the virus in the state. A few weeks ago, though, control over the information was taken away from the department.\n\nIn a farewell note, Jones offered a word of caution about the data still being presented on the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cAfter all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.\u201d\n\nOnce the White House gave the green light for states to scale back distancing measures at the end of April, Florida quickly moved forward with doing so. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a strong Trump ally, announced that the state would begin to reopen on May 4 \u2014 one day before Jones was removed from her position. The state did not reply to questions from Florida Today about the change in management of the data.\n\nIn Georgia, a different data-based kerfuffle emerged late last week. The state, which moved even more rapidly than Florida to scale back social distancing measures, has been a subject of scrutiny about whether it moved too quickly. So far, neither Georgia nor Florida has seen a significant increase in new infections \u2014 but things have not gone quite as well as one graph from the state\u2019s Department of Public Health made it seem.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical reporter Stephen Fowler noticed an anomaly in the graph showing a consistent downward trend in new cases in several large counties. That trend was a function of the data being shown out of order \u2014 May 1 was followed by April 30, which was followed by May 6, for example. The state claimed it had made a mistake, seeking to show data in a more readable way, without success. As Fowler noted, this wasn\u2019t the primary graph detailing the spread of the virus on the site, bolstering the idea that it was simply a mistake, albeit a mistake that, at first glance, bolstered Republican Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s decision to reopen Georgia.\n\nAs the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, though, this was only one of a number of data mistakes or changes made by the state government. To some extent, this is a natural function of the fluid, shifting pandemic. It nonetheless raises questions about the validity of the numbers being used to evaluate Georgia\u2019s progress and introduces the possibility of outside influence.\n\nTrump and his allies are certainly aware of the focus on the numbers undergirding the pandemic. The president has consistently focused on the number of new cases of coronavirus and the death toll from covid-19, the disease it causes, as measures of his administration\u2019s success. At times, he has been explicit about his efforts to keep the numbers from being inflated, as when he said at the beginning of March that he preferred to keep passengers on a ship anchored near San Francisco to prevent the number of cases in the United States from spiking.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Axios reported on a different effort by the administration to tweak the numbers. Worried about a continually increasing death toll from the virus, Trump \u2014 echoing voices on Fox News and in the conservative media \u2014 argued that the totals were being overcounted. In reality, the death toll is almost certainly being significantly undercounted, but that is far less politically useful to a president seeking reelection in November.\n\nAgain, there is a natural uncertainty to a number of these metrics, offering cover to efforts to shape what they say. In Nebraska, counts of new infections at meatpacking plants were climbing quickly \u2014 until the state stopped reporting the numbers. Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) argued that some of those who had been infected were misreporting their places of employment, making the numbers seem worse than they were. Public pressure eventually helped prompt the companies to release information about new infections.\n\nNationally, the data show that the number of new cases each day and the number of deaths from covid-19 have each declined. That\u2019s obviously good news and bolsters the idea that the nation can cautiously begin relaxing some containment efforts. The question that arises, however, is whether states and the federal government will respond if those cases begin to rapidly increase again. Will there be a new push for social distancing rules?","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1451,"url":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/florida-coronavirus-dashboard-architect-fired-202856243.html","publisher":"Yahoo!

Here Are Their Plans.\n\nTo date, nearly 2,000 Floridians have died and 46,442 have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Despite the ongoing public health issue, Gov. Ron Desantis announced last week his plan to open up Florida\u2019s virus-stricken economy.\n\nThe news of Jones\u2019 ouster was first revealed in a May 5 farewell email she sent to researchers and members of the public who signed up to receive updates on the data portal. In the email, Jones said her department was no longer responsible for updating information on the site \u201cin any shape or form.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months.

I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard provides daily updates on the numbers of deaths, new cases, and tests for every county in the state. Seen as one of the leading trackers in the state, the portal is heavily relied upon by officials, academics, and residents as Florida moves toward restarting the economy three months after issuing a stay-at-home order.\n\nAccording to internal emails obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, reporters contacted the department on May 4 about a field of data that showed when residents first began to report their virus symptoms or testing positive. The data, according to the emails, showed that Floridians were experiencing symptoms as early as Jan. 1\u2014three months earlier than when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the state.\n\n\u2018Hopefully, The Virus Is Dying in That Room\u2019: A New York Nurse Bids Farewell to a Coronavirus ICU\n\nThat field of data vanished from the portal several hours later, the Times reported. Then, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry messaged Jones asking her to \u201cdisable the ability to export data\u201d from the interactive COVID-19 site.\n\n\u201cPer Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately,\u201d Curry wrote, referring to Dr. Carina Blackmore, the director of the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection in Florida. \u201cWe need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, Jones responded saying \u201cthis is the wrong call\u201d before complying with the request.

These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal,\u201d Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, said in a Tuesday statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cAn independent investigation into these allegations is needed immediately.

All totals are cumulative, and include past positive cases and deaths.\n\nIf states fully reopen with no social distancing rules in place, as many as 5.4 million people could test positive for coronavirus. And if states reopen while still practicing measures of social distancing, nearly 4.3 million people are projected to be diagnosed with COVID-19 by the third week of July.\n\nPartially reopening the states with social distancing rules in place would result in nearly 3.2 million positive cases.\n\nThe forecast represents a large uptick in positive cases in the United States which currently stands at 1.5 million, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.\n\nAnd according to the PWBM, the number of deaths would also start to rise as states reopen.\n\nCustomers stand in line outside \"Forever 21\" store inside a Mall west of Fort Lauderdale, on May 18, 2020.

A full reopening would result in 231,000 deaths. If all the states reopened without adhering to social distancing guidance, that number leaps to 293,000.\n\nWhile these numbers are large, they represent a revision downward from Wharton\u2019s previous forecast of 350,000. They are also much larger than other models.\n\nAccording to the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model, the current projected death toll stands at roughly 144,000 by Aug. 4.\n\nWhile the forecasts seem to warn against a full reopening of states, the model does project positive data economically if states reopen.\n\nThere are over 1.5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster\/Yahoo Finance) More\n\nKeeping states in lockdown with full social distancing in place will cause U.S. GDP to shrink by 10.8% year over year by July 24, but reopening states would save the U.S. from the severe economic losses.\n\nTowards the end of July the model forecasts, if states reopen GDP would decline by 7.7% compared to the year prior.

Projected declining enrollment is a major concern, as well.\n\nEarlier this month, Central Michigan announced that Alford was taking an 8% pay cut, and the school's three highest-paid coaches \u2014 Jim McElwain (football), Keno Davis (men's basketball) and Heather Oesterle (women's basketball) \u2014 would see 6% pay cuts. Western Michigan recently announced similar pay cuts, and also Tuesday, Eastern Michigan said its football and basketball coaches would get 7% salary reductions.\n\nCentral Michigan joins other Mid-American Conference schools Akron (men's cross country, men's golf, women's tennis) and Bowling Green (baseball) in cutting sports. Additionally, the MAC announced the elimination of several postseason conference tournaments, and scaled-down basketball tournaments.\n\nAlford said there are no plans to cut additional sports teams, but also said there's little to no chance of men's track ever being brought back, even if the financial outlook improves in the coming years.\n\nIn his conference call with reporters, Alford choked up multiple times talking about the student athletes.\n\n\"We've been trying to make it work,\" said Alford, who has been bouncing between six and seven different budget models. \"It's just impossible to make it work without this reduction.\"\n\nThe last Division I school in Michigan to eliminate teams was Eastern in March 2018, axing men's swimming and diving and wrestling, and women's tennis and softball. A lengthy court case forced Eastern to reinstate women's tennis, and it is in the process of adding women's lacrosse to substitute for softball.\n\ntpaul@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @tonypaul1984","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1501,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/dont-save-the-economy-change-the-economy-coronavirus-covid19\/","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Dennis J.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1511,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2020\/05\/19\/coronavirus-barbers-and-hair-stylists-defy-stay-home-orders\/5198486002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Josh Peter']","title":"Bootleg barbershops and hair salons thrive as coronavirus stay at home orders persist in some states","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/15\/USAT\/ad7fea50-dd88-41e3-91df-15474a7eaa03-001_XXX_Haircuts_053.JPG?crop=5251,2954,x0,y450&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"Carmelle Harris saw the man standing at the open front door of her house.\n\n\u201cAre you here for the haircut?\u2019\u2019 she asked.\n\nHe was, and so Harris, wearing an N95 face mask, handed sanitary wipes to the man, and led him to the makeshift barber's chairin the living room.\n\nSoft music played in the background as a breeze kicked up and wind chimes jingled. The smell of citrus-scented candles and incense co-mingled as the customer, John Batinovich of Hollywood, settled into the barber's chair.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a great set up here,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also illegal \u2014 and during the coronavirus pandemic, the hair industry is drawing legal scrutiny across the country.\n\nIn Texas, Shelley Luther was arrested after she defied an order to close her salon during the COVID-19 outbreak. She spent two days in jail and was fined $7,000.\n\nIn Michigan, Karl Manke's professional and business licenses were suspended after he refused to close his barbershop. Manke, 77, was charged with two criminal misdemeanors for defying the governor\u2019s stay-at-home orders.\n\nIn California, the state has threatened disciplinary action against open salons and said it is investigating 651 related complaints. The city of Los Angeles has filed criminal complaints against four hair salons and one barbershop \u2014 along with 55 other businesses \u2014 that were open in violation of the city\u2019s Safer at Home orders, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said last week.\n\nAlso last week, the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health in New York announced that a barber had tested positive for COVID-19 after cutting hair after the state put shutdown orders in place.\n\nThe number of hairstylists setting up shop at home or coloring and cutting hair at customers\u2019 homes is on the rise as stay-at-home orders in states like California have stretched beyond eight weeks, more than a dozen hair stylists and industry experts told USA TODAY.\n\nFinancial pressure is cited as the chief reason hairstylists like Harris of Compton, California have put their cosmetology licenses at risk. Two weeks ago, Harris decided she had little choice.\n\n\u201cDo I take a chance and get turned into a criminal because I decided to work and pay my bills on time?\u2019\u2019 said Harris, 38. \u201cOr do I just sit and watch my bills pile up, so when the economy does open up I\u2019m thousands and thousands of dollars in debt?\u2019\u2019\n\nThere is no legal ambiguity in the state.\n\n\"California law requires that all services be performed in a licensed establishment,\u2019\u2019 Cheri Gyuro, public information officer for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, told USA TODAY. Similar laws are in effect in every other state, said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association.\n\nBut the hairstylists and barbers are fighting to regain legal work opportunities during the pandemic.\n\nLast week , The Center for American Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of the Professional Beauty Federation of California. It was an attempt to get hair salons reopened statewide.\n\n5,000 miles away, stylists are worried\n\nIn Connecticut, Salon owner Odete DaSilva said she is among thousands of hairstylists and salon owners urging Gov. Ned Lamont to push back the May 20 date when salons and barbershops will be allowed to reopen. She said they fear the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 are too high to go back to work and allowing them to do so would end their ability to collect unemployment benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a divisive issue, right?\u2019\u2019 said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association. \u201cOur members are the same way that the rest of the country plays out. Half are thinking, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s too soon, let\u2019s wait and make things safe.\u2019 And the other half is, \u2018Let\u2019s go-go-go-go.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe sense of urgency led one Southern California hairdresser to create in her garage a makeshift salon, complete with a hood dryer and a shampoo bowl. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her cosmetology license could be revoked but allowed USA TODAY to take photos.\n\nUpon arrival, the hairdresser said, her clients have been instructed to text her rather ring the doorbell to keep her two dogs from barking and eliminate unnecessary noise that might draw attention from neighbors.\n\nThe choice to defy or abide by state orders that govern the hair industry has become part of pandemic politics.\n\nAfter Luther was released from a Dallas jail, Texas senator Ted Cruz got a haircut at her Salon \u00e0 la Mode. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced he would pay Luther\u2019s $7,000 fine, although the salon owner now has ample money to handle it.\n\nShe received more than $500,000 from a GoFundMe campaign that was started a day before she reopened her salon, and recently Luther started a nonprofit called \u201cCourage to Stand.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn May 14, Luther told USA TODAY she was driving from to Michigan to offer support for Manke, the barber who is facing jail time after refusing to close his barbershop in Owosso, a town of about 15,000.\n\n\u201cMy attorneys have been in touch with his attorneys,\u2019\u2019 said Luther, 46. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just showing my face, I need to go out there and support this man.\n\n\u201cRight now, I want to speak with actions and make sure everybody in the United States realizes that we\u2019re getting our rights and freedoms taken away, and we need to take them back immediately.\u2019\u2019\n\nManke did not reply to interview requests.\n\n'Everything is super clean'\n\nIn an interview at the small stucco house where she lives with two roommates, Harris did not speak about politics. But she spoke intently about health and safety, saying she recently completed two online courses and received COVID-19 certification from Barbicide, a company that sells products designed to clean and disinfect salons.\n\nOne of Harris\u2019s roommates was helping her disinfect between customers.\n\n\u201cEverything is super clean,\u2019\u2019 Harris said of her makeshift salon.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology will be impressed based on warning it issued May 1 by social media.\n\n\u201cThe Board urges licensees to follow the stay at home orders,\u2019\u2019 the post read. \u201cIf businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license. This will not be taken lightly.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut last week, at the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills, the front door was open and a hairstylist was cutting a man\u2019s hair. Neither were wearing a face mask. Susie Mutch, the global marketing director for Sassoon, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Brookhaven, Mississippi, Dedra Edwards said she's worried for hairstylists and barbers going back to work after her brother Eugene, a longtime barber, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 46.\n\nDedra Edwards said her family thinks 46-year-old Eugene Edwards was infected with COVID-19 during a hair show in Jackson, Mississippi on March 15. Eugene Edwards was not wearing a face mask because the hair show was held before the state-at-home order was imposed, according to Dedra Edwards.\n\nShe said safety should be paramount as salons and barbershops reopen.\n\n\u201cI know they\u2019re using masks,\u2019\u2019 Dedra Edwards said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know the client you\u2019re working with, and you can carry COVID-19 and not have any symptoms.\u2019\u2019\n\nSafety was part of the motivation when the Center for American Liberty filed the lawsuit on behalf of the PBFC, said attorney Fred Jones, counsel for the group representing the beauty and barbering industry.\n\n\u201cTell me, what\u2019s safer,\u201d Jones said, \u201chaving (hairstylists and barbers) go from one kitchen to the next kitchen? Or having all of those ladies and men come into the controlled environment of the salon, where they maintain cross-contamination controls?''\n\nAfter entering Harris\u2019s home, Batinovich explained that he'd seen her on Craigslist, where a slew of hairstylists are advertising their services. The demand is high, several hairstylists told USA TODAY, and Harris said she averages between five and 10 customers per day.\n\nShe is charging $20 a haircut and making about as much as she does when she\u2019s working at a Floyd\u2019s 99 Barbershop.\n\nWorking with an electric razor, small comb and scissors, Harris needed about 20 minutes to complete Batinovich's haircut.\n\n\u201cYou look good,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nBatinovich smiled.\n\n\u201cI feel good,\u2019\u2019 he said.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1514,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/reviewedcom\/2020\/05\/19\/cant-find-clorox-wipes-during-coronavirus-pandemic-heres-what-buy-instead\/5221153002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-19","author":"['Shayna Murphy']","title":"Can\u2019t find Clorox wipes?

This is especially true when it comes to cleaning wipes, which topped the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) list of disinfectants that can help protect against COVID-19. Lysol spray and Clorox wipes could even potentially be in low supply through the end of June.\n\nWhatever you do, don't panic\u2014you can still get your hands on enough cleaning supplies for the whole family\u2014and skip the big crowds in stores\u2014if you shop them at these online retailers.

We put together comprehensive instructions on how to do so.\n\nHow to use cleaning wipes\n\nIf you already have cleaning supplies around the house, you'll want to be certain that you're using them the right way. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), disinfection won't happen immediately\u2014it can actually take up to three to five minutes.\n\nAlthough wipes and sprays are on the EPA's list of approved disinfectants, you may not be using them long enough to keep whatever surface you're cleaning\u2014like a countertop, for instance\u2014wet for the recommended amount of time to kill germs.\n\nAs a good rule of thumb, you may want to set a timer so you can monitor surfaces to ensure they're still wet. You may also want to make sure that you're sanitizing frequently-used objects and surfaces daily, especially when it comes to doorknobs, keyboards, faucet handles and more. You don't want to forget your phone, either\u2014you can even use Clorox wipes or 70% isopropyl alcohol on Apple products, according to Apple.\n\nJonathan Chan, senior lab testing technician at Reviewed, recommends following best practices, and advises that if you're using wipes, you should make sure you're only wiping in one one direction, as studies have suggested that doing so can reduce the risk of recontamination.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task & Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.\n\nPentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle \u2014 also not yet finalised.\n\n\u201cAll indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cThis will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.\u201d\n\nAs well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks; continued shortages of personal protective equipment; and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.\n\nAs recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would \u201cdeliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was \u201ca goal\u201d, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.\n\nRead more\n\nThis is the truth about a future coronavirus vaccine\n\nVaccine trial volunteer on potential coronavirus breakthrough\n\nThe dangers of America winning the race for a coronavirus vaccine\n\nPentagon comments after Trump brags about \u2018super duper missile\u2019\n\nPentagon sacks point person on Defence Production Act","news_guard_score":95,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Left-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1544,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontpagemag.com\/fpm\/2020\/05\/coronavirus-deaths-and-lockdown-larry-elder\/","publisher":"FrontPage Magazine","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":"['Larry Elder']","title":"Coronavirus Deaths and Lockdown","image":"https:\/\/cms.frontpagemag.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_full\/public\/uploads\/2020\/05\/despair.jpg?itok=ebI1rBM6","body_text":"What about 'Deaths of Despair'?\n\nAs of this writing, more than 80,000 Americans have contracted and died from the coronavirus. But how many have or will die from what some call \"despair\"?\n\nConsider the following call to my radio show:\n\n\"Hi, Larry. I was calling about people who have called suicide hotlines and different things with this loss of income. I am a widow of somebody who did commit suicide because of income. It was not now, during the epidemic, but it was because of dwindling income and hopelessness, which he hid from me. I had no idea this was going on in his business life. And I came home from work one day and found him hanging in the garage. He did leave a note about the different debts and things like that, but financial problems are a horrible thing \u2014 just a horrible thing that's worse than the virus.\"\n\nNo doubt going back to work increases a person's chances of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. More will contract the virus and die from it than would have been the case under continued lockdowns. But this, of course, is not the full picture.\n\nA new report, \"Projected Deaths of Despair During the Coronavirus Recession,\" suggests as many as 75,000 Americans could die from \"despair\" due to unemployment, depression from isolation, and fear of the indefinite and uncertain nature of the pandemic. One of the study's authors, Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust in Oakland, California, said: \"Deaths of despair are tied to multiple factors, like unemployment, fear and dread, and isolation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already an unprecedented number of deaths of despair. We wanted to estimate how this pandemic would change that number moving forward.\" The study estimates that there could be 75,000 coronavirus-related \"deaths of despair\" from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. Miller explained, \"The isolation is causing people to lose boundaries on their behaviors. ... People have to be working and we have to get people connected to other people.\"\n\nAbout the study, Dr. Elie Aoun, vice chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, said: \"I've been seeing this in practices and my colleagues have been talking about it, too. ... Addiction patients are relapsing, and a lot of patients who don't have drug use or alcohol problems are drinking more now, sometimes every day from 4 or 5 p.m., and they don't stop until they sleep.\"\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote about the connection between suicide and unemployment. A British journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, published a study associating worldwide suicides to unemployment. \"Our findings reveal that the suicide rate increases six months before a rise in unemployment,\" said study author Carlos Nordt. \"Our data suggest that not all job losses necessarily have an equal impact, as the effect on suicide risk appears to be stronger in countries where being out of work is uncommon.\" The study said that between 2000 and 2011, there were an estimated 233,000 suicides in 63 countries, and that the number increased during the last recession: \"While the number of unemployment-related suicides increased by about 5,000 during the recent economic crisis in 2008, this analysis shows the risk of suicide among jobless people is high even in good economic times.\"\n\nUnemployment stands at 14.7%, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated. Betsey Stevenson, former member of the Council of Economic Advisers as well as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, says due to an incorrect classification of \"people who were employed (but) absent from work due to COVID-related reasons as temporarily unemployed,\" the actual number of unemployed is likely over 20%.\n\nA new ESPN documentary about the Chicago Bulls' last championship season describes how Michael Jordan broke his foot early in his pro career, during the third game of the 1985-86 season. Defying his doctors' expectations, the foot healed faster than expected, and Jordan itched to return to the court despite team owner Jerry Reinsdorf's fear not only that Jordan could reinjure the foot but that such a reinjury could end his career.

As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.\n\nPer the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.\n\nImmediate Relief Funding\n\nRecognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.\n\nEligibility for Immediate Relief Payments\n\nPer guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group\u2019s central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).\n\nIn order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, \u201cCare does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.\n\nPayment Distributions\n\nPayment distributions will be based on the provider\u2019s or practice\u2019s share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments \u2013 which can be obtained from their organization\u2019s revenue management system \u2013 by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.\n\nReceiving Payments\n\nIn partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with \u201cHHSPAYMENT\u201d as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.\n\nProviders must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.\n\nDifferent Types of Providers\n\nAll relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer\u2019s organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.\n\nThe Remaining $70 Billion\n\nAs part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.\n\nCOVID-19 Medical Expenses\n\nThe federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from \u201cbalance billing\u201d any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.\n\nIn addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member\u2019s cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers \u2013 such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system \u2013 to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.\n\nHeavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding. In the meantime, medical professionals can access more information about and the latest developments concerning the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund here.","news_guard_score":30,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1564,"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/entertainment\/celebrities\/2020\/05\/20\/coronavirus-oprah-winfrey-gives-12-m-home-cities-during-pandemic\/5227201002\/","publisher":"USA Today","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":[],"title":"Oprah Winfrey gives $12M to \u2018home\u2019 cities during coronavirus pandemic","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/04\/03\/USAT\/033d511f-89b9-4dab-9539-96bdf97eec6e-GTY_1202662597.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y66&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp","body_text":"The Associated Press\n\nOprah Winfrey is giving grants to the cities she\u2019s called home through her $12 million coronavirus relief fund.\n\nShe announced Wednesday that her Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation will donate money to organizations dedicated to helping underserved communities in Chicago; Baltimore; Nashville, Tennessee; Milwaukee; and Kosciusko, Mississippi, where she was born.\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m talking about it is because there is going to be a need for people of means to step up,\u201d Winfrey said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI mean, this thing is not going away.

Then I moved out to people who I\u2019ve worked with and known who maybe would be out of work. I started literally here, working my way out, and then into the community.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u2019s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00bd years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play that game,\u201d said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201cI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u2019re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201d\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u2019s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u2019t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u2019t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201cSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u2019s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201d he said on May 1. \u201cIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201d\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u2019s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201cAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201d argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201cThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf things don\u2019t look like they\u2019re bouncing back by September, I think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u2019t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u2019s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201ceconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1577,"url":"https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/business\/2020\/05\/20\/target-results-online-campaign-coronavirus\/5227356002\/","publisher":"The Detroit News","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":"['Anne D Innocenzio']","title":"Big box rules: Target's online campaign readied it for virus","image":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/05\/20\/PDTN\/0a537977-8e95-4565-a3c6-a9d97f2339b8-AP20141397134170.jpg?crop=5576,3137,x0,y265&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds","body_text":"New York \u2014 Online sales at Target more than doubled as the pandemic put millions in lockdown during the first quarter, revealing further the critical role big box stores played in getting supplies to an immobilized population.\n\nThe Minneapolis company reported Wednesday that comparable-store sales, which include online purchases, rose 10.8% for the three-month period that ended May 2.\n\nThat was fueled by a 12.5% jump in the number of items customers bought with each trip to the store as families made major restocking runs, but fewer of them.\n\n\u201cLast quarter was unlike anything I have ever seen,\u201d Target's CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a conference call. \u201cIt was intense.

(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\n\nThe pandemic has widened an already growing rift between companies that deftly followed consumers online, and those that have struggled.\n\nJ.Crew, Stage Stores, Neiman Marcus, and J.C. Penney have all sought bankruptcy protection in recent weeks.\n\nA years-long campaign by Walmart and Target to challenge Amazon.com online was, as it turns out, a dry run for the pandemic.\n\nTarget had already transformed its 1,800 stores into distribution hubs, putting it in a better position than even Amazon.com to keep supplies flowing.\n\nTarget's stores were directly involved in supplying goods for 80% of online sales. Same-day services, such as curbside pickup at stores for things ordered online, nearly tripled.\n\nThe company has 5 million new users on its website, and 2 million have begun relying on Target's services like curbside pickup for things ordered online.\n\nTarget picked up market share in all five of its merchandise categories, Cornell said. Sales of items like furniture and electronics surged 20%. It was the same for groceries.\n\nClothing sales, a high-margin category for retailers, slipped during the quarter, but that business began to rebound at the tail end of the quarter. Cornell cites government stimulus checks for that late bump in discretionary spending.\n\nIt is unclear if other retailers, particularly those that are still closed, saw the same uptick with the arrival of those checks.\n\nAs with other retail companies operating in a pandemic, costs soared as well. Target spent and additional $500 million on things directly related to the outbreak. It's bumped up hourly pay for workers by $2. It has now extended emergency pay for those workers to July 4. Target also spent money to sanitize stores and warehouses, new protections for workers an signage for customers to ensure social distancing.\n\nCornell said those costs will be the new reality going forward.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a premium on creating a safe sanitized shopping environment,\" he said. Shopping while minimizing human contact is the new normal, he said, referring to drive-up and curbside pickup.\n\nTarget reported an 11.3% increase in revenue, which hit $19.62 billion for the quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $19.02 billion. Net earnings slid 64% to $284 million, or 56 cents, or 59 cents when adjusted for non-recurring events. That's far better than the per-share profit of 44 cents that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet.\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/business\/2020\/05\/20\/target-results-online-campaign-coronavirus\/5227356002\/","news_guard_score":92.5,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1578,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/05\/20\/coronavirus-back-to-school-272592","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-20","author":"['Ashleigh Furlong']","title":"Europe learning the dangers of going back to school after coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/static.politico.com\/2f\/9e\/dab822ed46228c20635fa30d7106\/webp.net-resizeimage%20(3).jpg","body_text":"It\u2019s \u201cone of the most difficult things\u201d for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible balancing task.\"\n\nWith no easy answers, Europe hasn\u2019t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.\n\nIn Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.\n\nTo complicate matters, parents aren\u2019t always on board with their government\u2019s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be \u201cguinea pigs,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the children who need to be considered.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,\u201d said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nWhat all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.\n\nWhen the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.\n\n\u201cIn every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,\u201d said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.\n\nBut in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.\n\nThe emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an \u201curgent need\u201d for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's \u201ctemporarily\u201d linking the syndrome to Covid-19, \u201cbased on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.\u201d\n\nBut to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.\n\n\u201cThe risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,\u201d said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. \u201cIt shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers aren\u2019t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it \u2014 a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest fear,\u201d Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.\n\nBut the (limited) evidence doesn\u2019t support this.\n\nIreland\u2019s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, \u201cchildren are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nThe one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the \u201cevidence remains limited.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO\u2019s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's \"Andrew Marr Show\" on May 17 that it seemed that \u201cchildren are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.\u2019s doctors' union, when it supported the country\u2019s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.\n\nMcKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is \"premature\" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is \u201cproblematic\u201d and its contact-tracing system \u201cuntested.\u201d\n\nAnd some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.\n\nDevi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.\n\n\u201cThis puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cLarge national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.\u201d\n\nWhen to reopen the schools has been the \u201cmost delicate\u201d issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L\u2019Echo. He warned of another danger \u2013 that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.\n\nHarry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this \u201cprobably one of the biggest disruptions we\u2019ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.\u201d\n\nFor Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.\n\nIndeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.\n\nBut the problems don\u2019t stop when schools reopen.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,\u201d said Quilter-Pinner. \u201cIt\u2019s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.\u201d\n\nReturning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we have choices to make,\u201d said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.\n\nAlastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of \u201cvarious known risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,\u201d he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.\n\nWith no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles: \u201cIn any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.\u201d\n\nJames Randerson and Carmen Paun contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Health Care.

Come on, man. What is he doing?

References to faith-based groups were removed from the final 60-page document, an unnamed CDC official told CNN.\n\nMichigan conservative group to hold 'Operation Haircut' on Capitol lawn\n\nThe Michigan Conservative Coalition, an organization intended to shape policy and help more conservatives win election, will hold what it's calling Operation Haircut outside the Capitol on Wednesday.

Under that scenario, about 54,000 fewer people would have died by early May.\n\n54,000 people, 36,000 people. Those are big numbers.\n\nEven small differences in timing would have prevented the worst exponential growth, which by April had subsumed New York City, New Orleans and other major cities, the researchers found. After Italy and South Korea had started aggressively responding to the virus, President Trump resisted canceling campaign rallies or telling people to stay home or avoid crowds. The risk of the virus to most Americans was very low, he said. \u201cNothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on March 9, suggesting that the flu was worse than the coronavirus. \u201cAt this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\u201d\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with New York, where the leadership, including Bill de Blasio and Andy Cuomo were resisting shutdowns, and where New York City's Health boss was telling people to go to Chinatown and see the parade.\n\nIn the New York metro area alone, 21,800 people had died by May 3. Fewer than 4,300 would have died by then if control measures had been put in place and adopted nationwide just a week earlier, on March 8, the researchers estimated.\n\nThat would be quite a trick considering the number of nursing home deaths.

Part 3: Polar Explorer\n\nHome\n\nStories Post-virus future: 4 trends that will shape the global economy\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world, the media have been rife with predictions of an imminent economic crisis of historic proportions. The scenarios range from apocalyptic to slightly less so, which is understandable, since a cure for COVID-19 has yet to be found, and a vaccine isn't expected any time soon. The more optimistic prognosis envisages this as a chance to remake society and build a better future.\n\n\"The Great Lockdown\"\n\nJob seekers visit a National Agency for Employment (Pole Emploi) office in Nice after France reopened its agencies following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease\/REUTERS by Eric Gaillard\n\nThe IMF predicts that the world will 'very likely' experience the worst recession since the 1930s, and expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020, which is a sharp downturn after years of continuous growth. Strict social distancing orders and lockdowns implemented by authorities around the world brought much global economic activity to a halt. The FTSE, Dow Jones and the Nikkei indices have all seen massive falls since the outbreak began. Global trade could, by various estimates, plummet by 13% to 32%, depending on the depth and extent of the crisis.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, the United States GDP is projected to nosedive by 24% in the second quarter of the year. And when GDP plummets, people lose jobs.\n\nIn April the US unemployment rate soared to 14.7%, which is worse than at any time since the Great Depression (and just two months ago it was at 3.5%).\n\nIn China, some 80 million people may already be out of work, with more to join them. The pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade and is putting a significant strain on national healthcare systems. Travel restrictions implemented by nearly 100 countries have left tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors, and transportation services in a shambles.\n\nThe IMF has dubbed the current crisis \"the Great Lockdown\".\n\nThe magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed (the lockdown) is unlike anything we\u2019ve experienced in our lifetimes. Gita Gopinath Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund\n\nWith the global health emergency adding an unprecedented level of uncertainty into the equation, the leading economists and global thinkers map out a new life after the virus. Here are the four principle trends likely to shape the global economy in the post-COVID era.\n\nNew isolationism (aka \"islandisation\")\n\nThe virus spreads with movement. Since the start of the pandemic, governments have tightened travel regulations between and within countries, which are likely to stay in place with varying degrees of severity at least through the end of the year.\n\nWhile most epidemiologists agree the current virus outbreak will last between 18 and 24 months, coming back in waves of different intensity, borders can't possibly stay locked for that long.\n\nMany countries are currently preparing to reopen \u2013 whether based on improved health data or due to the inability to sustain losses caused by the lockdown\/Lei Jiang via Unsplash\n\nTo facilitate limited cross-border movement, group-based isolation models are already coming into play. Australia and New Zealand have committed to introducing a trans-Tasmanian \"COVID-safe travel zone\", the Baltic states are creating a \"travel bubble\" for their citizens. In contrast, the European Commission has released guidelines for lifting travel restrictions \"between areas or member states with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations\". Greece, on the other hand, is planning to mandate so-called \"health passports\" for tourists entering the country \u2013 such travellers will be waived an otherwise mandatory quarantine. Similar steps will be, likely, taken by other countries in an attempt to renew international travel, yet prevent new virus outbreaks.\n\nThese isolation models may result in stratification of society into two groups: those who'd developed immunity and those who haven't.\n\nSpeculation about the introduction of the so-called \"immunity passports\" for US citizens have been circulating for quite some time now. Still, civil right activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union \u2013 the country's largest civil rights group, \u2013 are sceptical about the idea. The thinking behind it is to identify those that could safely return to work and resume travel. This would disproportionately hurt the non-immune population and jeopardise civil rights and liberties \u2013 perhaps even tempting some to get sick just to develop anti-bodies and continue with their lives.\n\nMany countries, including the US, have been heavily relying on Chinese imports. \/REUTERS by Regis Duvignau\n\nIsolationist tendencies in manufacturing are kicking in as well. Up until now, significant companies organised production using global value chains \u2013 that is, relocating production to low wage countries to cut costs. After the economic crisis of 2008\/09, global value chain expansion may have come to a halt. However, recent developments revealed many countries, including the US, have been heavily relying on Chinese imports. It became painfully apparent with regards to medical protective equipment.\n\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests in 2018 \"China provided 43 per cent of world imports of face shields, protective garments, mouth-nose-protection equipment, gloves, and goggles\".\n\nThe same holds true for electronic components, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals, metals and other supply components imported from China and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, Mexico and Vietnam.\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus supply chains have been thrown into disarray: logistics became virtually impossible to control, and the prices on specific articles sky-rocketed as components and raw materials became scarce. With the IMF's World Uncertainty Index (WUI) \"three times the size of the uncertainty during the 2002\u201303 <\u2026> (SARS) epidemic and about 20 times the size during the Ebola outbreak\" many corporations started to consider regionalisation of manufacturing. The US-China trade war has been another factor influencing this decision.\n\nDisruptions introduced by the virus will likely remain a problem even after countries ease lockdowns and restart economic activity, so producing vital goods within national borders will become a priority. This may signal a retreat by global companies in favour of local players. As for export-oriented Asian economies, they may want to turn \"inwards\" catering more to local markets.\n\nReducing nonessential economic activities and offering added value\n\nThe current crisis isn't your ordinary economic crisis. The prescription for solving a regular financial crisis is relatively simple: the government spends and doles out stimulus funding until people start consuming and working again. In the case of the coronavirus crisis, it's health safety first. Therefore, we can't aim at fast economic recovery, as the whole point of quarantine and social distancing is to stop people from going to work and spreading the disease.\n\nThe economist James Meadway writes that the correct response to the COVID-19 crisis would not be a massive upscaling of production, but rather a massive scaling back of production.\n\nBeing able to reduce output without threatening livelihoods is vital for economies trying to be more resilient to pandemic crises.\n\nThis holds true for both the manufacturing and service sectors. Of course, different industries are being affected differently: aviation, tourism, and hospitality are hit the hardest unable to diversify and cope with the lost demand.\n\nA sign at a McDonalds drive-thru advertises free meals for first responders and healthcare workers amid the coronavirus disease \/REUTERS by Brian Snyder\n\nMajor manufacturing companies, on the other hand \u2013 American household goods giant Kimberly-Clark and Coca-Cola with dozens of brand names under the belt, \u2013 are limiting the number of products they make, focusing on the ones in highest demand. Scalability, as well as the potential for diversification, will be a bonus: the UK Royal Mint, for instance, started producing medical visors for hospital use, while Dyson and many other manufacturers are producing ventilators or PPE. Being able to provide added value is also important: in the US national fast-food chains like McDonald's and Subway started to offer free delivery, others introduced everyday grocery items along with their menu staples.\n\nFast technological advances\n\nRobotic automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for the success of supply chains as they help reduce the need for humans to work face to face. With changing modes of consumption and interaction, more and more businesses will go \"digital first\".\n\nAfter the coronavirus has been tamed, many former office workers will continue to work from home, as this model has proved successful and less costly.\n\nTechnological and mental barriers that made a presence on-site essential have been overcome \u2013 this is, in fact, one of the significant effects the pandemic has had on the work scene.\n\n\"I imagine the pandemic will speed up the development of the infrastructure needed to support our online work,\" says Susan Schneider, director of the \"AI, Mind and Society Group\" at The University of Connecticut, adding she's worried that \"\u2026in a post-pandemic world, corporations may make less use of human labour, replacing human workers with automation and AI. Computers and robots don't get sick.\"\n\nA Japanese girl making friends with a robot at Kuromon Ichiba Market, \u014csaka-shi, Japan\/Andy Kelly via Unsplash\n\nWhether humans will remain the dominant workforce or not, remote work and learning that require connectivity and access to online resources, the increase in the number of online payments and day-to-day operations will make us even more dependent on tech companies.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles, 'telehealth' and new space technologies are gaining momentum, moving from the realm of science fiction into the mainstream.\n\nWhile some sectors of the economy will never be the same again, new ones will gain popularity and attract investments, among them security services, independent communication systems, and self-sustaining housing solutions.\n\nStronger government involvement in social and economic life\n\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, the role of government has undergone a dramatic change. Nations are looking to their respective governments to mobilise medical resources, implement containment measures and offer financial help. Free market solutions aiming at making a profit rather than catering to the public good aren't much help when millions of people lose their livelihood overnight. The American government is offering small business loans and direct payments to a vast number of people. Apart from that, the Senate promised to pay $50 billion in bailouts to airlines and $130 billion in aid to hospitals. Germany will spend some \u20ac40 billion to bolster small businesses, and in Denmark, the government is ready to cover 75-90 percent of salaries if companies do not lay off their employees. But unprecedented help comes with unprecedented control.\n\nA Colombian police officer operates a drone that measures body temperature, in an area of high contagion amid the coronavirus disease in Bogota, Colombia \/REUTERS by Luisa Gonzalez\n\nBoth democratic and authoritarian regimes imposed quarantines, closed borders and implemented a variety of stringent measures. In the streets of China, drones search for people without face masks and chastise them over loudspeakers. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individuals' phone records. The UK's recently passed coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the right to arrest suspected virus carriers and have them tested. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Belgium use data from major telecommunication companies to track people's movement. The list goes on and on.\n\nShoshana Zuboff, the author of \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" believes a pandemic is a perfect chance for governments to start monitoring their citizens more closely.\n\nMeasures that were once viewed as emergency ones may become a permanent rollback of civil rights.\n\nLiberally-minded folks who fear this scenario are particularly concerned that, given the currently prescribed social distancing, activism has been reduced to \"clicktivism\". That means sitting at home on social media feeds and venting online, instead of rallying and being engaged in other forms of political protest.\n\nWhen it comes to the economy, a certain degree of government intervention may not be such a terrible idea, as argued by free-market zealots. The Spanish flu of 1918 was, after all, a catalyst in the development of public health systems across quite a few countries, as many governments embraced the concept of socialised medicine.\n\nFor the last 25-30 years the most developed countries have been cutting down on public health programmes, and the current pandemic will perhaps encourage some to rethink their approach.\n\nSpeaking about scenarios global economies might be pressured to follow after the pandemic, analyst Simon Meir uses terms \"State capitalism\" and \"State socialism\". The first model being predominantly concerned with pursuing exchange value, and the second \u2013 with protecting life itself rather than protecting markets. The extreme version of the latter would involve nationalisation of healthcare, food and energy production and, perhaps, providing free housing. State capitalism, on the other hand, doesn't allow for extensive state intervention into the economy, apart from short-term loans for saving businesses. The author, however, points out that these models are likely \"to bleed into one another\". And this is what we're currently witnessing, with the pro-market Trump administration openly talking about taking stakes in airlines, oil and defence companies in exchange for grants.\n\nThe pandemic has opened a window to creating new ways and institutions to deal with the suffering, including more effective measures to stop the trend toward greater inequality.

He introduced me to the science of animal reflexes. A novel stimulus induces in an animal, however briefly, a freeze reaction. This is called an \u201corienting reflex.\u201d What happens next depends on the animal\u2019s response to the potential threat. If the novel stimulus does not seem to be a threat the animal gradually relaxes. Repeats of this type of stimulus gradually habituate its orienting reflex so that the animal, in effect, learns to ignore this particular stimulus.\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of a real threat, the animal can only respond in one of two ways: It can freeze for an extended length of time or it can panic and run to escape.\n\nHumans, too, experience the orienting freeze reflex to novel stimuli. If the stimulus is a threat, a person may freeze in place for a substantial time, or the person may flee in panic. Or, and this is what makes humans different from all animals, some people may become coldly rational and plan out, and execute, an appropriate course of action. Training, especially, helps create this rational response.\n\nThe important thing to note is that the orienting reflex is so essential to survival that it evolved very early in the history of life. Its creation was back so deep in time that we share the orienting reflex with insects, with spiders, and with even more primitive creatures.\n\nSociety emulates an organism. An animal is a collection of functioning elements, all working in cooperation. It is useful to consider a society, such as America, as a kind of organism analogous to an animal. Individual people make up the cooperating functional elements of society. I postulate that our society has an orienting reflex, as well.\n\nConsider the response of America to Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor: Shock! Freeze! Anger! That was the first orienting response. Then, since we are human, came coldly rational plans, then fully unified action to destroy this threat to our existence. Consider America\u2019s first response to 9-11. Initially it was the same, but soon different factions chose to use the event to promote their ideologies. Instead of unity we had disunity. America has changed \u2014 and not for the better.\n\nThink of America\u2019s response to COVID-19. We indeed have had the orienting reflexive freeze. What is this new threat? We wondered. What are its characteristics? What should we know about it? Because of the novelty of this virus we knew too little to make rational plans. Our natural reaction was to continue the orienting freeze reflex until we could find a way to defeat it.\n\nWe did know at the beginning a few things about this new disease: We knew that this virus is exceptionally contagious. One thing we thought we knew (but maybe were wrong about) was that this virus is exceptionally deadly. The thing we were certain of was that a really serious pandemic would overload our medical facilities. Rational response required a temporary lockdown to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d so as to not overload our medical establishment. This we did \u2014 successfully.\n\nBut then politics intervened \u2014 big time! There are people in our society who lust for power and luxuriate in it once they have it. Some are elected, many are not. Call them governors, call them mayors, call them health administrators, call them bureaucrats, call them \u201cjournalists,\u201d the power mad have become a potentially lethal plague on America. They have suspended our civil liberties \u201cfor the duration.\u201d\n\nSo what is the duration? These power-mad people have moved the goal posts to the undeterminable far future when a vaccine cure will be available. There has never been a successful vaccine for an upper respiratory corona virus. So don\u2019t count on it this time. If we do get one an instant Nobel prize awaits. Waiting for a vaccine is just an excuse for continued suppression of our liberties. Moving the goal posts is profoundly dishonest and un-American.\n\nIn the name of \u201cscience\u201d some governors forbade experimentation with various pharmaceutical treatments. When President Trump suggested that early experiments indicated that a combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin was effective in stopping an early stage infection, the Left: left academics, left \u201cjournalists,\u201d left bureaucrats, and left politicians, went berserk: Politics (I spit the word out)!\n\nIt is commonplace to say that the pandemic is a science problem. No it is not! Science has to do with fundamental understanding. Figuring out the molecular action of this coronavirus is science. Defeating the pandemic is not science. Defeating the pandemic is engineering!\n\nWhen I was just starting my career as an engineering physicist I was told a story. The story is likely apocryphal, but it illustrates the profound difference between science and engineering: One day the ancient Romans decided to bring fresh water down from the mountains to the city. Naturally they hired the best hydraulic specialists \u2014 the Greeks \u2014 the masters of the science of hydrostatics. The Greeks said that the pressure in a tall waterpipe would be very great. They were right, of course. Therefore, buttress the outside of your filled pipes, they advised, to prevent their explosion. The Romans did as suggested. However, when the water started to flow the pipes imploded instead of exploded. No one knew why this happened. The Romans simply shrugged their shoulders and buttressed the inside of these water pipes \u2014 with great success. About two thousand years later the Bernoulli brothers found the scientific explanation. So, science is nice, but engineering works.\n\nWho are the engineers in this pandemic? The doctors on the front line, of course. These are the pragmatic guys who are willing to try anything to save the lives of their patients \u2014 even if the academic scientists say don\u2019t. Let\u2019s also give credit to the hands-on lab scientists who are working, often with great ingenuity, to find a vaccine. That too is engineering, only at the molecular level.\n\nNow that the pandemic is easing up a bit I was able to chat about this with a highly regarded infectious medicine specialist. This is a man who once saved my life by working in his lab to devise an antibiotic cocktail for me. This, after all conventional treatments had failed. This good doctor has spent almost every waking hour of the last two months saving the lives of COVID patients, some of whom were in intensive care. He has found that the hydroxychloroquine cocktail works with patients in the early to mid-phase of infection, but not much in the intensive care phase. He uses other techniques in the late phase. His experience with the cocktail corresponds to that of other doctors. The hydroxy cocktail is therefore a very effective prophylactic, or curative, depending on the stage of infection. But not later on.\n\nWhen I mentioned the notion that, in this pandemic, he was an engineer, not a scientist, he most emphatically agreed. Then this mild mannered man surprised me by using very strong language with respect to the \u201cscience\u201d advisors to the politicians.\n\nScience has its place. Ultimately we will understand this new contagion and eliminate its threat. In the meantime, it is the medical engineers who are the key to defeating this invader: the medical doctors on the front line; the people working on vaccines and other medications. And, of equally great importance, let us not forget the business owners, small and large, who are the engineers of our economy. All these practical people should be the ones guiding society back to normality \u2014 not the power hungry politicians and, most especially, not the technocrat \u201cscientists.\u201d","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1638,"url":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2020-05-21-dr-faucis-warp-speed-vaccine-gets-media-applause-concerns-surface.html","publisher":"Natural News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Lance D Johnson']","title":"Dr. Fauci\u2019s \u201cwarp speed\u201d vaccine gets media applause but serious concerns are beginning to emerge","image":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/91\/2020\/05\/Coronavirus-Latex-Gloves-Vaccine-Test-Covid-19.jpg","body_text":"(Natural News) There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no better way to get the stock market climbing again than to pump billions of emergency taxpayer dollars into vaccine companies, while cutting safety regulations for new cell-manipulating, gene-altering biologics. This is exactly what President Donald Trump, the FDA, and the federal coronavirus task force seem to be doing. They are fast-tracking experimental injections through clinical trials so they can be distributed en masse with the assistance of the U.S. military.\n\nThe federal government is hastening the scientific process and therefore polluting and corrupting it. The President\u2019s \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarp speed\u00e2\u0080\u009d demands for mass-produced biologics will inevitably cause unintended consequences, as biologics are unavoidably unsafe. (1 Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC)\n\nThese inevitable vaccine injuries will no doubt be swept under the rug and be handled by the Department of Health and Human Services and the special master of the Vaccine Court. This system was set up in 1988 to pay off select families of vaccine-injured children while granting vaccine makers legal immunity, preserving faulty vaccine supply. To make matters worse, the HHS has recently admitted in court that the lawfully required safety studies have not been conducted to improve vaccine safety over the past thirty-two years.\n\nTo heighten the coercion, several governors have announced extended state-wide lockdowns and restrictions, claiming that there will be no going back to normal until a vaccine or pharmaceutical is widely available. This is medical coercion empowered by the force of government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the likes of which the world has not witnessed since the rise of the Nazis. Not only is the scientific process being bastardized, but state governments are being used to punish certain businesses and suppress the people, to coerce the population to comply with upcoming, fast-tracked biologics and gene therapy injections.\n\nThe vaccine that the world is being held hostage for is coming along great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 WAIT A MINUTE!\n\nOn January 11, Chinese authorities shared a genetic sequence of novel coronavirus with US vaccine company, Moderna. Just two days later, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NSAID) finalized the sequence for mRNA-1273, allowing Moderna to manufacture the sequence for clinical trials. The NSAID is governed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead spokesman for the federal coronavirus task force, and the same man who helped fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology where China conducted controversial research on bats and coronavirus gain-of-function.\n\nThis sequence is not the only coronavirus mutation identified by scientists. This year, there have been over thirty coronavirus mutations identified, each circulating in different hemispheres and regions, eliciting various viral loads and gain-of-function properties, causing various symptoms, ranging from a mild cold to symptoms much more severe.\n\nOn March 23, it was declared that the vaccine wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be commercially available for 12 to 18 months; however, Moderna announced that it could be available for \u00e2\u0080\u009cemergency use\u00e2\u0080\u009d before the end of the year. Moderna was then awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to enable large scale production of mRNA-1273. The company announced a worldwide collaboration with a biotechnology company named Lonza, to manufacture up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273 per year.\n\nNow, this is a new kind of vaccine that inserts lab-grown genetic RNA material into your body, forcing an invasion into your cells. After the RNA material invades your cells and hijacks your cell\u2019s ribosomes, it forces the cells to produce viral components such as the iconic spike protein. This vaccine-augmented, self-replicating spike protein, produced within the cells, is intended to train the immune system to fight. This manipulation of cellular protein encoding will never be adequately studied for safety in clinical trials, for it\u2019s real effects can only be observed in the population over time.\n\nThe government and the vaccine makers have already prepared this biological preparation for mass distribution long before it had ever been researched through any credible scientific process, long before it had ever passed any serology efficacy test, or passed any animal safety tests, including primate and ferret studies. In tests on guinea pigs, 20 percent suffered serious reactions within 43 days, mirroring similar results that were obtained on the infamous SARS vaccine trials that caused pulmonary immunopathology in animals upon subsequent infection.\n\nThis new RNA sequence is currently being tested on people and rushed through human clinical trials so it can be released onto populations that are currently being coerced to accept a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew normal\u00e2\u0080\u009d until this cell-hijacking, gene-altering Holy Grail vaccine is available.\n\nAccording to the pharmaceutical-funded media, this Holy Grail has passed through Phase 1 with flying colors. The RNA viral sequence and its accompanying formulation (undisclosed) has elicited an immune response in a small group of human participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years. This vague news has caused the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock valuation to surge to 29 billion, an astonishing valuation for a company that currently sells zero products.\n\nModerna is using the pharmaceutical-funded media to their advantage, blitzing the media with corporate success talk but providing little data on real life efficacy and safety. How will this hijacking of cellular protein production and forced augmentation of antibodies hold up over time and how does it affect human DNA?\n\nScientists at the NSAID, who developed the vaccine prototype, are usually quick to advertise their successes. They have made no comment on the phase 1 trial and are currently quiet on the matter. Moderna, on the other hand, trumpeted their phase 1 results, watching their stock market valuation soar. Their press release praised the development of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbinding antibodies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and omitted the fact that only eight out of forty-five vaccine recipients have so far developed neutralizing antibodies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the kind that are needed. The antibody assessment comes after participants received two doses of the vaccines and had their blood tested two weeks later. The researchers will never know if these antibodies are durable, whether they will convey any form of short or long-standing immunity. Moreover, this new RNA encoding and its artificial augmentation of an immune response could have repercussions as the immune system could attack the body\u2019s own cells. Could these RNA messenger immune augmentations ultimately generate strong type I interferon responses, leading to chronic inflammation and inflammatory conditions?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to see the data to make my own interpretation of the data,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think it is at least encouraging that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen immune responses with this RNA vaccine that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen with previous RNA vaccines for other pathogens. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be enough, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two weeks is very early, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if those antibodies are durable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon further investigation, the vaccine appears to trigger the production of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbinding antibodies\u00e2\u0080\u009d that foreshadow the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathogenic priming\u00e2\u0080\u009d that caused deaths in early SARS coronavirus vaccine experiments that failed to come to market during the 2002-2003 outbreak. Moreover, there is a 20% percent \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious\u00e2\u0080\u009d injury rate among the extremely healthy volunteers in the high dose group, which elicited medical intervention or hospitalization. Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured was more prevalent in the young or the old. Lastly, Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured is harmful upon subsequent infection, is capable of causing autoimmune issues, or causes damage to cellular processes that cannot be undone.\n\nSources include:\n\nStatNews.com\n\nSupremeCourt.gov\n\nUSCFC.USCourts.gov\n\nTimesHerald.com\n\nChicago.SunTimes.com\n\nModernaTX.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNYPost.com\n\nIndependent.co.uk\n\nJournals.Plos.org","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1648,"url":"https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/2020\/05\/us-banks-on-hook-for-150-billion-in-frozen-loans-as-millions-of-americans-skip-credit-card-and-car-payments.html","publisher":"Activist Post","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":[],"title":"US Banks On Hook For $150B In \u201cFrozen Loans\u201d As Millions Skip Credit Card And Car Payments","image":"https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/credit-cards-1024x682-1024x682-1-1024x682-1024x682-1-1024x682-1024x682-1-1024x682-1024x682-1.jpg","body_text":"Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020\n\nA new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5\/01\/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5\/14\/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201ctesting and contact tracers\u201d to be sent directly to everyone\u2019s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201cfor other purposes,\u201d such as \u201csupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201d\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201cnational COVID health emergency.\u201d Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u2019ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and\/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201cfaith-based\u201d and \u201cschool-based\u201d institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201cconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201d require no viral testing, and only \u201csuspicion of infection.\u201d This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201cpublic health safety,\u201d into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201cwar on terror,\u201d but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201cNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201d Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"","reliability":0},{"news_id":1685,"url":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/21\/l-a-countys-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-2000\/","publisher":"Los Angeles Daily News","publish_date":"2020-05-21","author":"['Hayley Munguia']","title":"L.A.

County officials did not have details on the six remaining fatalities other than to say three occurred in Long Beach, and the other three happened in Pasadena.\n\nOf all of the people who have died in the county from coronavirus-related causes, about 39% were Latino, 29% were white, 17% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% identified as another race.\n\nAbout 92% of people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19 have had underlying health conditions.\n\nMore than 403,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in the county, Ferrer said, and about 9% of those people have tested positive for the virus.\n\nAs Los Angeles County moves forward with lifting closures that were intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Ferrer said officials are keeping a close eye on the number of cases and deaths, as well as indicators like hospital capacity and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.\n\nMost of those measures are headed in the right direction, she said. The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to one person with the virus infecting one other person on average, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is very good news, and it shows that what we\u2019re doing over past few weeks \u2014 staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings \u2014 has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.\u201d\n\nThe average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.\n\n\u201cAs a community, we\u2019ve done this together,\u201d she said, \u201cand this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.\n\n\u201cAs we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we can do this. Of this I\u2019m certain because we\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve worked together. We\u2019ve been doing our part, and we\u2019ve saved lives as a result.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Right-center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1714,"url":"http:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2020\/05\/22\/625874\/Rohingya--settlements","publisher":"Press TV","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"PressTV","image":"https:\/\/cdn.presstv.com\/photo\/20200522\/2b3703d7-a368-4e63-9de6-ec2ca0266ae8.jpg","body_text":"After stripping away the autonomy of Kashmir through the revocation of articles 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution, Kashmir's independence is again under a new threat which is the new domicile law.

You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5\/01\/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5\/14\/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201ctesting and contact tracers\u201d to be sent directly to everyone\u2019s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201cfor other purposes,\u201d such as \u201csupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201d\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201cnational COVID health emergency.\u201d Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u2019ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and\/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201cfaith-based\u201d and \u201cschool-based\u201d institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201cconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201d require no viral testing, and only \u201csuspicion of infection.\u201d This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201cpublic health safety,\u201d into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201cwar on terror,\u201d but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201cNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201d Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"","reliability":0},{"news_id":1730,"url":"https:\/\/truepundit.com\/trumps-vaccine-czar-has-vast-ties-to-drug-industry-posing-possible-conflicts\/","publisher":"True Pundit","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"Trump\u2019s Vaccine Czar Has Vast Ties to Drug Industry, Posing Possible Conflicts \u2013 True Pundit","image":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/truepundit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Trump\u2019s-Vaccine-Czar-Has-Vast-Ties-to-Drug-Industry-Posing-750x375-1.jpg?fit=750%2C375&ssl=1","body_text":"The chief scientist brought on to lead the Trump administration\u2019s vaccine efforts has spent the last several days trying to disentangle pieces of his stock portfolio and his intricate ties to big pharmaceutical interests, as critics point to the potential for significant conflicts of interest.\n\nThe scientist, Moncef Slaoui, is a venture capitalist and a former longtime executive at GlaxoSmithKline.

New research has now emerged that might soon become a further target for Donald Trump's ire.\n\nA new observational study conducted among more than 96,000 patients diagnosed with coronavirus and treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine concluded that the usage of these drugs was associated with a higher risk of death or development of hearth arrhythmias among recipients, according to the medical journal The Lancet that published the research.\n\n\u201cWe were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19\u201d, the study\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cEach of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19\u201d.\n\nThe observed patients, hospitalised between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020, were recruited from 671 hospitals in six continents and divided into five groups: those who did not receive any treatment by these drugs (control group), those who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine alone, and those who received any of these drugs in combination with macrolide (antibiotic).\n\nThe researchers found that the mortality rate was the highest among those 6,221 patients who received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%), while the treatment of coronavirus with hydroxychloroquine alone in a group comprising 3,016 patients resulted in an 18% death rate. Those 8% of patients combining HCQ with antibiotics were also more likely to develop a heart arrhythmia, the study argues.\n\nMeanwhile, around 1 in 6 patients treated with chloroquine (16.4%) and 22.2% of those who combined it with an antibiotic died during the study.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS \/ Reuters Photographer A nurse shows a pill of hydroxychloroquine, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at Nossa Senhora da Conceicao hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil, April 23, 2020\n\nIn comparison, only 1 in 11 hospitalised patients from the control group fell victim to coronavirus during this period. However, to be fair, the control group was the largest one observed in the study, covering more than 80,000 patients, around 7,546 of whom died.\n\nThese results prompted scientists to conclude that the treatment of coronavirus with HCQ was not really beneficial.\n\n\u201cPrevious small-scale studies have failed to identify robust evidence of a benefit and larger, randomised controlled trials are not yet completed\u201d, said the study\u2019s co-author, Dr. Frank Ruschitzka, as cited by CNN. \u201cHowever, we now know from our study that the chance that these medications improve outcomes in COVID-19 is quite low\u201d.\n\nThis research was published shortly after US President Donald Trump revealed this week that he was taking HCQ as a precautionary measure against coronavirus, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the risks of doing so outside of a hospital setting and without proper vetting from health authorities. Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used in America for the treatment of malaria, lupus and some other diseases upon prescription for more than six decades, however its utility for the treatment of coronavirus is at best unproven.\n\n\u201cThat was a false study done. Where they gave it to very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration\u201d, Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.\n\nThe US president still insists that the use of HCQ to fight COVID-19 is a \"game changer\u201d and he slammed an earlier non-peer reviewed study that found a link between the use of the antimalaria drug and an increasing number of deaths among corona-stricken veterans.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1745,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/05\/22\/trump-churches-evaneglicals-coronavirus-274842","publisher":"Drudge Report","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['GABBY ORR']","title":"Behind Trump\u2019s demand to reopen churches: Slipping poll numbers and alarm inside his campaign","image":"https:\/\/static.politico.com\/fa\/ed\/8361fc3b47e087c2a62da8d5b83f\/200522-trump-ap-773.jpg","body_text":"On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,\u201d Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. \u201cI want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.\u201d\n\nSome Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president\u2019s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cEvangelicals for Trump\u201d coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states\u2019 rights issues,\u201d said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday \u2014 that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions \u2014 was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.\n\nGuidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments \u2014 including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities \u2014 did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump\u2019s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.\n\nAs the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it\u2019s likely become harder for the president\u2019s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.\n\n\u201cIf grandma\u2019s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there\u2019s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cThis is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.\u201d\n\nPart of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus \u2014 and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions \u2014 as a threat to religious freedom. The president\u2019s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.","news_guard_score":29.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1780,"url":"https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/2020\/05\/here-comes-the-wave-loan-defaults-hit-6-year-high.html","publisher":"Activist Post","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"Here Comes The Wave: Loan Defaults Hit 6-Year High","image":"https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/debt-slave-waking-times-1024x561-1-1024x561-1024x561-1024x561-1024x561-1024x561-1.jpg","body_text":"Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020\n\nA new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5\/01\/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5\/14\/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201ctesting and contact tracers\u201d to be sent directly to everyone\u2019s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201cfor other purposes,\u201d such as \u201csupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201d\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201cnational COVID health emergency.\u201d Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u2019ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and\/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201cfaith-based\u201d and \u201cschool-based\u201d institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201cconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201d require no viral testing, and only \u201csuspicion of infection.\u201d This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201cpublic health safety,\u201d into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201cwar on terror,\u201d but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201cNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201d Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below.","news_guard_score":7.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"","country":"","reliability":0},{"news_id":1801,"url":"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/05\/22\/trump-coronavirus-state-department-275139","publisher":"Politico","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":"['Gabby Orr', 'Nahal Toosi']","title":"Trump administration might consolidate pandemic response at State Department","image":"https:\/\/static.politico.com\/d7\/9f\/f3ba772342f3b6c227db4b39d363\/200522-state-gty-773.jpg","body_text":"The overall effort, first reported by the media platform Devex, is described as the President\u2019s Response to Outbreaks, or PRO.\n\nUnder the proposed initiative, the State Department would appoint a coordinator to oversee nearly every aspect of pandemic preparedness and response \u2014 from the global distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the development of modernized protocols to prevent the spread of an outbreak.\n\n\u201cHaving a singular initiative to focus global attention and resources has been an effective model to turn the tide of diseases like HIV\/AIDS and malaria,\u201d reads an outline of the new model that U.S. officials planned to circulate on Capitol Hill. \u201cThrough PRO the U.S. will assert global leadership for mobilizing private and public partners, multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors to support a global pandemic response that will deliver results for the American people.\u201d\n\nThe proposal comes as senior administration officials grapple with ongoing flaws in the federal government\u2019s response to Covid-19, which has pitted top agencies against each other as they work to secure medical supplies for U.S. stockpiles and other nations, and has often resulted in conflicting guidance from the White House and public health officials.\n\nThe plan could decrease USAID\u2019s role by consolidating pandemic preparedness under the State Department, which lacks the volume of supply chain experts, epidemiologists and public health experts on staff at USAID. There also are questions about whether the initiative will focus strictly on infectious disease outbreaks or be expanded to include other types of global health issues.\n\nOne USAID official familiar with the proposal described it as a \u201cpower-grab\u201d by the State Department. Another called it a \u201cturf fight.\u201d\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on \u201cpurportedly leaked deliberative documents.\u201d A spokesperson for USAID declined to comment.\n\nSome at USAID questioned whether now is an appropriate time to overhaul the existing response model given the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The number of pandemic-related deaths in the United States is nearing 100,000, and the Trump administration is shifting its focus to a swift reopening of the U.S. economy.\n\nBut, according to one USAID official, State Department leaders have been frustrated with USAID\u2019s response to the novel coronavirus, feeling it\u2019s been slow and not always aligned with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s priorities.\n\nMembers of the White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, also previously complained about USAID\u2019s distribution of medical supplies to other countries at the height of the Covid-19 crisis, when U.S. hospitals and front-line workers faced shortages of personal protective equipment.\n\nUSAID is technically an independent agency, but it is supposed to take policy guidance from the secretary of State, whose department plays a role in USAID\u2019s budget management.\n\n\u201cMy read of it is they\u2019re unhappy with USAID,\u201d the USAID official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic. \u201cUSAID hasn\u2019t been able to deliver on certain things.\u201d\n\nDocuments circulated inside the administration were short on details about which programs at USAID could be relocated under the two components of PRO: America\u2019s Response to Outbreaks, and the Preparedness Initiative for Pandemics and Emergency Response. It will differ from programs such as the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, but will incorporate lessons from them, according to an FAQ.\n\nAside from working on the coronavirus response, Birx \u2014 who could not immediately be reached for comment \u2014 holds titles including U.S. special representative for global health diplomacy. She\u2019s been based at the State Department, and her duties include dealing with global HIV\/AIDS programs, including PEPFAR.\n\n\u201cThe goal at this stage is to develop a unified whole-of-government response and approach to pandemics that will allow us to bring together all of our government\u2019s tools to meet the challenges we will face in this new era of pandemics,\u201d one of the documents reads. \u201cAs the discussions progress towards implementation, we will clearly define specific roles and responsibilities across agencies, consistent with their mandates.\u201d\n\nAccording to the proposal, the ARO coordinator would work with government agencies and the private sector \u201cto ensure the full power and expertise of the United States are leveraged to \u2026 prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases and mitigate and prepare for future disease outbreaks.\u201d","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"High","political_bias":"Center","country":"USA","reliability":1},{"news_id":1810,"url":"https:\/\/themindunleashed.com\/2020\/05\/richest-americans-have-added-434-billion-in-wealth.html","publisher":"The Mind Unleashed","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"Richest Americans Have Added $434 Billion To Their Wealth Since Crisis Hit","image":"https:\/\/themindunleashed.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screen-Shot-2020-05-22-at-12.14.39-PM.png","body_text":"1.5K Shares Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nGet the latest from The Mind Unleashed in your inbox.

Her website is here and you can follow her on Twitter @caitoz\n\nAnti-Beijing sentiment is being deliberately whipped up by an imperialist America, its supine allies and supportive media oligarchs. But it\u2019s just self-serving propaganda that needs to be called out.\n\nChina is in the news every day now. Today here in Australia, we\u2019re pretending to be offended because a Chinese tabloid published the accusation that our nation is a \u201cgiant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US,\u201d even though we all know that\u2019s completely true and we should be flattered that at least they said \u201cgiant.\u201d\n\nBefore that, we were getting indignant over a hefty barley tariff in response to our facilitation of America\u2019s global anti-China spin campaign, which it turns out Washington screwed us on.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018GIANT KANGAROO\u2019 acting as \u2018dog of the US\u2019: Chinese newspaper mocks Australia amid trade row\n\nAnti-China sentiment has been thriving in Australia, aided by our Murdoch-dominated news media, State Department-funded think tanks explicitly geared toward manipulating the China narrative, and of course our own deep-seated racism and xenophobia.\n\nBecause of its geographical location, the US military\/intelligence asset conventionally known as Australia has been a major focal point for the US-centralized empire\u2019s propaganda campaign against the most powerful unabsorbed nation in the world.\n\nChina is in the news constantly now, and it\u2019s not because of any virus. It\u2019s not because of Hong Kong, it\u2019s not because of Uighurs, it\u2019s not because of intellectual property violations or any of the other scattershot, unrelated hodgepodge of excuses you\u2019re being fed as to why the Chinese government must be regarded as the latest Actual Hitler all of a sudden.\n\nChina is in the news all the time because of imperialism.\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on with China and why the \u201cnews\u201d media keep punching you in the face with stories about how awful it is, you really only need to grasp two basic points:\n\nPoint 1: We are in the middle of a slow-motion third world war between the US-centralized power alliance and the nations which have resisted being absorbed into it.\n\nA loose alliance of nationless oligarchs who use governments as weapons have secured control over a large empire-like cluster of nations with economic and military might loosely centralized around the United States. In order to gain more power and ensure its ongoing hegemony, this oligarchic empire must keep expanding by absorbing more nations and brutalizing them if they resist. China is by far the most powerful of the unabsorbed nations, followed by Russia at a distant second and Iran at a distant third.\n\nRead more\n\nNuclear weapons make another hot world war undesirable, so this one takes the form of resource control, economic warfare, staging coups, arming oppositional militias to use as proxy armies, expanding military presence in key geostrategic regions under the pretense of fighting terrorism, and \u201chumanitarian interventionism,\u201d with old-school full-scale ground invasions used only as a last resort, and only after manufacturing sufficient international approval to ensure the continued cohesion of the empire-like power alliance.\n\nBut the end goal is the same as that of a conventional world war: to beat the other side into submission and compliance. And, in this case, absorption into the imperial blob. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the prevailing orthodoxy in US power structures became that the US must maintain unipolar hegemony at all cost to maintain a \u201cliberal world order\u201d (even if it means abandoning \u201cliberal\u201d values whenever it\u2019s convenient). From that point on, the agenda has been global domination and the slow, suffocating subversion of anyone who gets in the way.\n\nPoint 2: Propaganda is used to move this world war along.\n\nIn a conventional war, each side has clear military objectives that everyone understands, and the weapons are naturally moved around in accordance with these objectives. In this weird slow-motion world war, nobody understands what\u2019s going on besides the major power players and those who are paying very close attention.\n\nThe various agendas against the governments of Iran, Venezuela, Russia, Syria, China, etc. appear different and unrelated when looked at individually, and indeed you will see different political factions supporting some of these agendas but not others. The only thing unifying this slow-motion movement toward the destruction and absorption of all unabsorbed nations is carefully constructed propaganda narratives.\n\nThe way these unifying propaganda narratives operate is simple. It would never occur to rank-and-file citizens that a nation on the other side of the planet that\u2019s pretty much just doing its own thing needs to be sanctioned, subverted and brought to heel, so the imperialist oligarchs who own the political\/media class make sure everyone is fed custom-made narratives according to their own ideological echo chamber to prevent any domestic inertia from being thrown on these agendas.\n\nAlso on rt.com Is the US abandoning its war on Iran to focus directly on the so-called China threat?\n\nOnce there\u2019s sufficient agreement that Saddam\/Gaddafi\/Morales\/Assad\/Maduro\/whomever must go, the campaign to subvert, sabotage and absorb that government can safely be escalated.\n\nIf you can understand points one and two, you can understand everything that\u2019s happening with China, and everything that will continue to happen. Propaganda narratives will be rolled out with increasing aggression which have the long-term goal of alienating China from its allies, hurting its economic interests, and preventing its rise to true superpower status and creating a multipolar world.\n\nAnd the funny thing is, none of this is necessary. Westerners have been deliberately propagandized into believing that China wants to take over the world and will do so unless kept in line by the United States, which has surrounded China with military bases in an act of extreme aggression that the US itself would never tolerate from any unabsorbed government. But if you really grill people on how they know that China wants to take over the world, you\u2019ll find they don\u2019t have any substantial evidence for it.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you that China has an authoritarian government which persecutes ethnic and religious minorities, wrongly claiming that this means they want to take over the world and inflict the same on everyone else. They\u2019ll tell you China has sought to expand control over some directly adjacent territories, wrongly claiming that this means they want to dominate the planet militarily like the US currently does.\n\nThey\u2019ll cite evidence which shows China is seeking to become a superpower and create a multipolar world (something China openly admits) and wrongly claim that this is proof that they are seeking to dominate the world with unipolar hegemony.\n\nThey won\u2019t be able to produce any actual, hard evidence that China is trying to take over the world and censor your internet and take away your rights, because no such evidence exists. It\u2019s a completely empty belief arising from aggressive narrative manipulation.\n\n\u201cOne myth I think really that needs to be dispelled is that somehow China is aiming to replace America and going to run the world, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Chinese venture capitalist and social scientist Eric Li on the John Pilger documentary The Coming War on China. \u201cFirst of all, the Chinese are not that stupid. The West, with its Christian roots, are about converting other people into their beliefs. The Chinese are not about that. It\u2019s just that \u2014 again, I\u2019m not degrading the Western culture, I\u2019m just pointing out the inherent nature, the DNA of two different cultures \u2014 the Chinese two thousand years ago built the Great Wall to keep the barbarians out, not to invade them.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say this is a reasonable summary. After European nations tried to conquer the planet just a few generations ago in the name of spreading Christianity and \u201ccivilization,\u201d we\u2019re projecting our sick vestigial colonialist values on a nation whose culture never drove it to such madness.\n\nAlso on rt.com 3 heavyweights in the ring: As US-China hostility escalates, what role will be played by the world\u2019s other great power, Russia?\n\nViolently dominating the entire planet for all eternity on the vague suspicion that another country wants to do the same to you is not sane, and is not an option. Unabsorbed nations should be allowed to remain unabsorbed, absorbed nations should have their sovereignty restored (or in Australia\u2019s case, granted to it for the first time since its existence as a nation), and America should begin acting like a normal country.\n\nThe notion of \u201cpre-crime\u201d is the purview of dystopian horror fiction when applied to individual people, and there\u2019s no reason we should find the prospect of attacking and destroying for hypothetical future offenses any less insane on an international scale.\n\nThere was never any reason for the coronavirus to be made into an issue of international conflict when it could just as easily be an issue of international collaboration, and indeed collaborating is what we should all be doing, with this virus and with everything else.

That said, most of these\u00c2 fixes are proven to be ineffective and based on no scientific evidence whatsoever.\n\nHow to prepare for COVID-19\n\nWith the pandemic still ongoing, COVID-19 remains an active area of research. Scientists are moving at a snail\u2019s pace when it comes to understanding the new coronavirus, but it cannot be helped.\n\nWhat can be helped, though, is our bodies. As with most infections and diseases, a person is more susceptible to pathogens if he or she isn\u2019t fit to begin with. While it\u2019s true that the virus can still latch onto the healthiest individuals, watching out for certain biomarkers of poor health can afford us time to turn things around before it\u2019s too late.\n\nWith that, here are some helpful tips to\u00c2 follow in preparation for COVID-19:\n\nWatch out for signs of diabetes\n\nAccording to recent reports from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to severe complications linked to COVID-19.\n\nOne reason for this is that infections tend to be harder to cure in general for people with diabetes due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels and the presence of diabetes complications. People with chronic diseases like diabetes also tend to be immunocompromised, thus making them more susceptible to COVID-19.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, some signs to watch out for include increased thirst, frequent urination, sudden weight loss, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, tender gums and frequent infections.\n\nAvoid foods that raise cholesterol and blood pressure\n\nHeart health depends on two major factors: cholesterol and blood pressure. Excess cholesterol can lead to clogged arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. High blood pressure, on the other hand, often leads to arterial stiffness, another major factor for heart disease.\n\nLike diabetes, heart disease makes a person more susceptible to severe complications related to COVID-19. People with heart disease tend to be weaker in general due to poor blood circulation. To support heart health, avoid the following foods:\u00c2 pastries, processed meat, red meat and canned foods.\n\nQuit smoking\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus targets the lungs, so quitting or refraining from smoking should be a no-brainer. A recent review published in\u00c2 Tobacco Induced Diseases\u00c2 established that smoking is associated with the\u00c2 negative progression and adverse outcomes\u00c2 of COVID-19.\n\nIn particular, smoking can exacerbate complications linked to pneumonia and the flu, two infectious diseases with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19. These complications include wheezing, shortness of breath, chronic coughs, chest pain and fever.\n\nExercise often\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence that being fit reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19, but recent studies show that exercise helps strengthen the immune system.\n\nExercise, in particular, can help flush out bacteria and other pathogens from the lungs, thus reducing the risk of catching a cold, flu and other similar infections.\n\nExercise also stimulates antibodies and white blood cells to work harder, resulting in the better detection of harmful pathogens. The rise in temperature after a period of exercise can also inhibit bacterial growth in the lungs.\n\nIn addition, exercise helps reduce cholesterol and regulate blood pressure.\n\nLose weight\n\nOverweight individuals are at an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. As discussed earlier, conditions like these can compromise an individual\u2019s immune functions and make them more susceptible to COVID-19.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s important to follow a balanced diet. Diabetic or obese individuals can take it a step further and follow a plant-based diet.\u00c2 This diet can include animal products, but a large chunk of it should be comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish and olive oil.\n\nCoupling a balanced diet with regular exercise can also help burn excess weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\n\nMaintaining a healthy body and a strong immune system greatly reduces your risk of catching COVID-19.\u00c2 (Related: Strengthen the immune system with these 12 superfoods.)\n\nLearn more about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at\u00c2 Pandemic.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nNCBI.NLM.NIH.gov\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nIDF.org\n\nTobaccoInducedDiseases.org\n\nMedlinePlus.gov","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1836,"url":"https:\/\/theduran.com\/quarter-of-americans-have-no-interest-in-taking-covid-vaccine\/","publisher":"The Duran","publish_date":"2020-05-22","author":[],"title":"Quarter Of Americans Have No Interest In Taking COVID Vaccine","image":"https:\/\/149425939.v2.pressablecdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/vaccine20rtrs.jpg","body_text":"Ron Paul recently warned \u201crushed-into-production\u201d vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people\u2026\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d a public-private partnership to develop a vaccine and ready it for mass production by early 2021, has generated anti-vaccine concerns among some Americans, a new survey finds.\n\nThe survey, published via Reuters\/Ipsos on Thursday, found 25% of Americans have no interest in taking a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nAbout 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe. Only 14% said they would be interested.\n\nReuters\/Ipsos surveyed 4,428 Americans between May 13-19 said they would need to review additional research on the vaccine to determine if it was safe.\n\nA little less than 66% were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in a vaccine if made readily available.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters, considering there are 92,000 virus-related deaths, he thought there would be a much higher amount of people that would want the vaccine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,\u201d said Schaffner. \u201cI would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.\u201d\n\nThe survey found 14% were not interested at all, 10% were not very interested, and 11% were unsure about subjecting themselves to a vaccine.\n\nHealth experts tell Reuters that, \u201cat least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as \u201cherd immunity,\u201d when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program aims to produce 300 million doses of a vaccine by January, a goal that we\u2019ve said is widely unrealistic.\n\nThe president\u2019s constant hype of vaccines has led some people to believe many of the drugs in development are being rushed and could have dangerous side effects. Ron Paul recently warned \u201crushed-into-production\u201d vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people.\n\nNearly 84% of respondents said vaccines for measles are safe, suggesting that people are doubtful about a rushed vaccine for COVID-19. Of the folks who were \u201cnot very\u201d interested in taking the vaccine, 29% of them said they would reassess their thoughts once the FDA approved it.\n\nPeter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where his staff is currently developing a vaccine, said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we\u2019ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.\u201d\n\nThe poll underlines how political divides among Democrats and Republicans predate the pandemic, but lockdowns have since catalyzed new divides and exacerbating old ones. That being, nearly 20% of Republicans said they had no interest in a vaccine, which was more than double the proportion of Democrats who said the same.\n\nWith creepy billionaire Bill Gates and big government rushing vaccines into development and for possible mass production next year \u2014 the anti-vaccine movement in America continues to grow.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.zerohedge.com\/health\/quarter-americans-have-no-interest-taking-covid-vaccine\n\nLiked it?

The U.S. is fast approaching a full 100,000 Coronavirus deaths, but this weekend, Trump went golfing at a course in northern Virginia that\u2019s a part of his own company. During a recent appearance on MSNBC, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered a memorable takedown of the efforts from the president and his allies to distract Americans from the actual devastation at hand. Ahead of the November election, Trump seems desperate to rush into any kind of rhetoric except the reality of the situation.\n\nFacts First: CNN's Daniel Dale digs into President Trump\u2019s false claims about a hydroxychloroquine study, mail-in voting and saying he was named Michigan\u2019s \u201cMan of the Year\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/SCWu25vqbI pic.twitter.com\/MH5Z0YlRoL \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 23, 2020\n\nAs Schiff summarized on Twitter:\n\n\u2018Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn\u2019t want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement.\u2019\n\nOver 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19.

Towards the beginning of the crisis, the president even claimed that concern about the virus was a \u201choax\u201d and suggested that coverage of the then-growing crisis was some kind of plot to make him look bad. That obviously was not true. More recently, the president\u2019s team\u2019s conspiracy theories have included the idea that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is some kind of untapped goldmine for Coronavirus treatment, but a new study reveals that among tens of thousands of Coronavirus cases, usage of the drug was linked with a higher death rate across the board.\n\nHydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by President Trump, is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to analysis of 96,000 patients published in the Lancet. Hydroxychloroquine is unproven for fighting coronavirus. https:\/\/t.co\/LpHS9CuEmL \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 23, 2020\n\nMost recently, Trump staged a spectacle at a White House press conference on Friday when he claimed that governors must allow churches and other houses of worship to reopen this weekend or else he would \u201coverride\u201d them and reopen the churches himself. Trump has no authority to \u201coverride\u201d governors, and besides, religious and political authorities around the country have already been collaborating on the development of safe reopening plans for houses of worship. Trump\u2019s spectacle was for show.\n\nBreaking News: If the U.S. had begun imposing social distancing measures one week earlier than it did in March, about 36,000 fewer people would have died in the coronavirus outbreak, according to new estimates from Columbia University researchers https:\/\/t.co\/phnyEgZice \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) May 21, 2020\n\nCheck out Twitter\u2019s response to Schiff below:","news_guard_score":17.5,"mbfc_level":"Mixed","political_bias":"Extreme left","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1850,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/shows\/watching-the-hawks\/489492-covid-19-plague-of-corruption\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"\u2018Plague of Corruption\u2019 & climbing Covid numbers","image":"https:\/\/cdni.rt.com\/files\/2020.05\/article\/5ec907b2203027026b12a893.png","body_text":"Dr Judy Mikovits and Kent Heckenlively discuss their new book, \u2018Plague of Corruption.\u2019 Covid-19 numbers continue to skyrocket as scientists race for a vaccine.

So today put a smile on my face, as most of your know we install docks, store boats etc. This morning I was out working when the office called me, there was a gentleman on hold who wanted his boat in the water before the weekend. Being memorial weekend and the fact that we started working 3 weeks late means there is no chance this is going to happen. Well, our office personnel had explained this to the man and he replied: \u201cI am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?\u201d The employee (his name has been blacked out to protect his privacy) continued: As you can imagine, that does make a difference, that would put you at the back of the line!!! Needless to say, our Governor and her husband will not be getting their boat for memorial day. He added: Too good not to share, I love it when karma comes around, even in small doses. To summarize, the Michigan\u2019s Democrat governor has placed the entire state of Michigan under lockdown for several weeks. On the same day that she announced she would be reopening businesses in certain areas of northern Michigan, which includes the area where her vacation home is located, her husband\u2019s vehicle is seen parked in their driveway. Two days later, when businesses that have been shut down for months are allowed to reopen, Governor Whitmer\u2019s husband calls North Shore Dock company and asks to take cuts in front of common Michiganders, because he\u2019s the husband of the woman who shut down their business in the first place. North Shore Dock, LLC put out a statement on Facebook a few hours ago, confirming that Governor Whitmer\u2019s husband did call their business and ask to have his boat put in the water. According to the North Shore Dock Facebook post, he was told he would not be given preferential treatment and that he would have to wait in line like everyone else, adding, \u201cALL of our customers are valued, and we cannot place you in front of others who scheduled earlier.\u201d\n\nIncredible!\n\nRead the rest here.","news_guard_score":20,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1897,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/489596-france-coronavirus-5g-postpone\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"French industrialist calls for 5G MORATORIUM amid Covid-19, conspiracy theories & burning of masts","image":"https:\/\/cdni.rt.com\/files\/2020.05\/article\/5ec984c285f5401daf63c67b.JPG","body_text":"The CEO of French telecoms firm Bouygues has called on the government to postpone auctions for 5G frequencies, citing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and public mistrust of the technology.\n\nFrance is planning on auctioning 5G frequencies to telecoms companies at the end of the summer. However, Martin Bouygues, head of the eponymous communications firm, now thinks that bidding should be pushed back to the end of the year at the earliest.\n\nAlso on rt.com DHS & FBI fear more attacks on 5G infrastructure fueled by Covid-19 conspiracies\n\n\u201cWe need to push back the auction date simply because the economic world today is not the same as it was early March, when the terms of the auction were set,\u201d he told Le Figaro on Saturday, adding that holding a bidding war while France recovers \u201cwith difficulty from a terrible human health and economic health nightmare\u201d is \u201cnot the priority of the country.\u201d\n\nBouygues is not an opponent of the technology. Indeed, his firm has already secured a 50 megahertz block, as have rivals Orange, Free, and SFR.\n\nHis opposition to the auction likely stems from the fact that France is currently facing an economic recession, with growth expected to drop by eight percent this year after an extended and nationwide lockdown. As such, the return on his investment simply wouldn\u2019t be as large as it would have been pre-pandemic.\n\nHowever, Bouygues also noted that the rollout of 5G technology has come in spite of growing public mistrust.\n\nAlso on rt.com Anti-5G fever spreads to the Netherlands as towers suffer \u2018arson and sabotage\u2019\n\nAside from claims that Chinese firms like Huawei could use 5G hardware to relay secrets to the government in Beijing \u2013 pushed by the Donald Trump administration in Washington and denied by Huawei and China \u2013 5G has become a target for conspiracy theorists the world over. Fueled by some lingering uncertainties over the potential health consequences of 5G\u2019s short wavelength transmissions, skeptics have claimed that 5G masts can trigger anything from cancer to Covid-19.\n\nSome of the more radical among these conspiracy theorists directly blame these broadcasting masts for causing the coronavirus in the first place, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims. 5G towers erected in the Netherlands and UK have been set on fire by activists, with British protesters going as far as spitting on and attacking the telecoms engineers installing the masts.\n\nThe situation is the same outside Europe too. Arson attacks on 5G infrastructure have been reported in Australia and New Zealand, while the US Department of Homeland Security warned last week that online \u201cmisinformation campaigns\u201d have \u201calready prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states.\u201d\n\nLike this story?

Sure, this led to a pluralistic society, and sure, there are major challenges for each faith group in competition with other such groups and with the predominant secularism in the US, but believers have always had the freedom to pray and worship as they like.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic brought in a wide series of restrictions against gathering in public places all over the world. In our own series on the rightness or wrongness of Orthodox Christian places of worship closing due to government regulations, we noted that the restriction on religious worship is not particularly directed at Christians only. Mecca is closed, the Indian, Japanese and some Jewish religious activities have all shown the effects of COVID-19 prevention regimes.\n\nHowever, in the United States, we now have elected leaders violating the principles set forth in the Constitution, namely, the very first Amendment:\n\n\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free excercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nInstead, we have governors ordering churches closed, people fined and even arrested for going, and in places like Mississippi, the sentiment against Christian churchgoers has turned particularly nasty. A parish was burned to the ground, acccording to The New York Times:\n\nThe burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church\u2019s defiance of coronavirus restrictions. First Pentecostal Church had sued the city of Holly Springs, Miss., which is about an hour southeast of Memphis, arguing that its stay-at-home order had violated the church\u2019s right to free speech and interfered with its members\u2019 ability to worship. After firefighters put out the blaze early Wednesday, the police found a message, \u201cBet you stay home now you hypokrits,\u201d spray-painted on the ground near the church\u2019s doors, according to Maj. Kelly McMillen of the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A photograph of the graffiti also appears to show an atomic symbol with an \u201cA\u201d in the center, which is sometimes used as a logo for atheist groups.\n\nOne thing this clearly proves is that bigots cannot spell correctly.\n\nBut it also proves there is a great deal of animosity against Christians. This kind of attack would not have taken place even ten years ago, but now the anti-Christian climate in the United States is such that incidents like this are looking for ways to happen.\n\nThis video shows how embedded anti-Christian attitudes are now in the press corps at the White House. Watch as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany deftly and forcefully handles the ferocious accusations that go beyond First Amendment sensibilities.\n\nOn Friday, May 22nd, President Trump called on state governments to allow churches to open, and has also threatened to override any state that refuses to do so. Here is what he said, with emphasis added:\n\nThank you very much. At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith. I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they\u2019ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time. Today I\u2019m identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It\u2019s not right. So I\u2019m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential. I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there\u2019s any question, they\u2019re going to have to call me, but they\u2019re not going to be successful in that call. These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well. They love their congregations. They love their people. They don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump has this basic point right: without prayer to God, our nation is sunk. And it is, indeed, amazing how vile and anti-Christian our supposed \u201cbest and brightest\u201d have turned out to be. Incidentally, the press and \u201cExperts\u201d are saying that the president has no power to make this stick. They are wrong. In the spirit of the First Amendment, he absolutely does have the power to make this order stick.\n\nLiked it?

This highly dangerous individual was put around vulnerable people who he could brutalize as well as possibly infect with COVID-19.\n\nThe assailant\u2019s father said that his son had been taken to a group home for supervision, but had a mental health relapse as he was hearing voices in his head. When he was taken to the University of Michigan Hospital for supervision as a result, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. That is when he was taken to the Westwood Nursing Center where he would commit his savage assault.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not the nursing home called the police to alert them about the assault that had taken place in their facilities. The assailant is currently in police custody, and it is yet to be determined if he will be charged for what he did.\n\nThe sickening video of the assault can be seen here:\n\ni have been sending this to every news anchor i can think of \u2026 do your part and help me so we can fckin help him \u2026 godfuickindamnit this makes me mad pic.twitter.com\/SuJD69IABV \u2014 \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0fuser(\"\/n\/3\/f\/\").adm1n=255()\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f (@nulluser10) May 21, 2020\n\n\u201cHe never should have been housed.. quarantined with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,\u201d the father said. \u201cSomeone dropped the ball.\u201d\n\nThe person who dropped the ball may have been Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a directive that forced COVID-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes.\n\nBig League Politics reported on how state Democrats are turning on Whitmer for essentially issuing death sentences to the elderly with her incomprehensible and arguably genocidal policy prescriptions:\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s heavy-handed authoritarian governance has made her a pariah throughout the state, and Democrats are starting to become frustrated with her leadership as a result. State representative Leslie Love (D-Detroit) is flabbergasted over Whitmer\u2019s order to send coronavirus patients into nursing homes, which has resulted in an untold number of unnecessary deaths by putting the most vulnerable population at needless risk. \u201cTo return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn\u2019t seem \u2014 it\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d Love said. Whitmer made an executive order in April that mandated seniors diagnosed with COVID-19 to be placed into nursing homes, called \u201cregional hubs,\u201d to be around other healthy seniors. State officials claim that the policy is effective because of distance requirements that are required between the healthy and unhealthy seniors. \u201cIt\u2019s a good move, a good step to make these regional hubs, and I think as we move forward, we have to look at making sure we\u2019re really implementing best practices, looking to other best practices across the state,\u201d Chief Medical Executive Joneigh S. Khaldun said. Initially, the state wanted to put the sick seniors at the TCF Center in Detroit but that became untenable after the site was shut down. This meant seniors with coronavirus were put into nursing homes among the vulnerable instead. Love is worried about individuals in nursing homes throughout the state, including her 86-year-old mother, catching the highly-infectious disease. \u201cThat would break my heart because I\u2019ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors \u2014 my mother, your mother, anybody else\u2019s mother \u2014 does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they\u2019re in a nursing home,\u201d Love said.\n\nComplicit government officials like Whitmer want to keep the panic going so they cannot be held accountable for their crimes against humanity in how they have responded to the pandemic.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Extreme right","country":"USA","reliability":0},{"news_id":1916,"url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/489558-ufc-dana-white-live-fight-island-month\/","publisher":"RT News","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"UFC boss Dana White says he'll live on Fight Island 'for entire month' - but location remains a mystery","image":"https:\/\/cdni.rt.com\/files\/2020.05\/article\/5ec8f6f820302707a401e967.JPG","body_text":"Dana White says he is planning to spend the whole of July on the UFC's fabled 'Fight Island' as the promotion switches events there during the Covid-19 fallout - but the location of the island remains a closely-guarded secret.\n\nThe UFC recently got back up and running with three events in a week in Jacksonville, Florida, and has another card planned for May 30 at its own Apex venue in Las Vegas - subject to Nevada state approval.\n\nBeyond that, White says he is planning on finally putting his 'Fight Island' plan into action - an idea which first emerged when the coronavirus outbreak began to ravage sport in the US.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Fight Island' is real: UFC files 22 new trademarks for 'Fight Island' and 'UFC Fight Island' ahead of COVID-19 comeback (VIDEO)\n\n\u201cPeople are very intrigued by \u2018Fight Island,\u2019 and I\u2019m excited for it,\u201d White told ESPN on Friday.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re looking at June and we\u2019re literally going to knock out three or four fights there in a month\u2026 I\u2019ll probably be there the whole month of July.\u201d@danawhite gives @Jon_Anik the latest update on Fight Island \ud83c\udfdd pic.twitter.com\/J5r6dbHnFn \u2014 ESPN MMA (@espnmma) May 22, 2020\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at June, and we\u2019re literally gonna knock out three or four (events) there in a month.\n\n\"And I\u2019m gonna stay on the island for a month.

We can already see resistance to these plans. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden insist that the EU only issue repayable loans, not subsidies. How can you explain the changed position on the part of the federal government? The federal government also spoke out against the so-called corona bonds.\n\nMr Fuest: What has been agreed here doesn\u2019t really concern corona bonds. Corona bonds were not a clear, clearly defined concept, while what has been proposed is a clear, feasible concept. I very much welcome it. I think it\u2019s important that Germany and France have come forward with a common initiative, the two states that quite often have different positions regarding EU finances, the two states that are very important to promote issues. Of course, other countries are also important and should be involved in this matter.\n\nIf we compare this with corona bonds, the corona bonds initiative, in my view, was a domestic policy initiative of the countries that presented this plan. They publicly demanded something from other states, knowing that they would refuse. It originally was something non-working. And such a policy, in my opinion, is taking place in Europe for domestic political reasons and is not constructive at the European level.\n\nI think that this initiative is constructive. A model has been agreed that can be implemented. The huge challenge that we are facing regarding this fund is to show that the costs that are coming up here have added value due to distribution at the European level.\n\nThis means that it\u2019s necessary to show that if the EU spends this money, it will be more beneficial than if member states lend money and spend it themselves. They could do that too. Member states must guarantee these debts. And the EU has virtually no income of its own.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s all based on member states guarantees. And it must be shown that this European fund, the money that is given out, is more useful, that this money is used on things that national expenses cannot provide.\n\nThere is considerable potential for the aforementioned European added value. For example, the added value may consist in the fact that all this will become insurance. That money will go to countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis. We have some ideas in this regard. But we still don\u2019t know exactly how much states will be affected.\n\nAccording to the IMF forecast, Germany has a negative growth of seven percent, and France has a negative growth of eight percent. In Italy, negative growth is nine percent. According to the IMF forecast, this means that these three states have been affected to a similar extent. We don\u2019t know whether things will get to this; it\u2019s still unclear who will get this insurance money and who will pay it.\n\nIf the whole thing is organized in such a way that those who are hardest hit, but who can insure themselves against this crisis, get something, it is creating added value. A nation-state cannot insure itself.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t help if all member states were hit equally. An insurance community where everyone suffers the same doesn\u2019t help. However, added value will appear if the crisis is asymmetrical.\n\nIn the end, solidarity is also added value. This means that there is interest on the part of all European states that no country will collapse economically or destabilize. And that could also be European value-added. But, nevertheless, it won\u2019t be easy to try to really spend money better than national money. This will need to be well demonstrated. If it works, this is very good.\n\nI think the initiative for this fund at the European level is so important because it is a political signal that the EU is alive, that the EU is acting in a crisis like this. That is a very important signal. A signal that the EU will still be there after the crisis is a signal to everyone. It\u2019s vital for the EU that certain actions are being taken here and that we can count on success.\n\nOn Political Debate\n\nI expect political debate in parliament, as well as in other European countries. They are also very important, namely regarding where the will money be used and how it be determined that added value appears. What does this mean for future debt policy in Europe?\n\nWe need to understand that Rubicon is crossed here. It is fundamental reform, extensive debt financing at the European level. This will raise the question of whether the whole thing will be a dam break, whether we\u2019ll have a sharp rise in public debt because we have a new level at which we also incur government debt, namely the European level.\n\nIt\u2019s a very serious question. The answer given in the German-French document is correct. It says that there will be a repayment plan for these debts. And member countries must pay for it.\n\nThere will be such a repayment plan that, I hope \u2013 that would be right \u2013 in the event of the next crisis, the state debt quota in Europe as a whole \u2013 national, regional and European \u2013 won\u2019t be higher than before this crisis. It will be better if it is lower. All of these issues will be discussed.\n\nQuestion from France: Is this initiative Merkel\u2019s answer to Macron?\n\nI don\u2019t think this is Merkel\u2019s response to Macron, because this is the response to the crisis. The German-French document says a lot about European health policy. It\u2019s necessary to create response groups.\n\nIt would be great if we had them when the pandemic broke out. This fund is a unique thing, a unique debt mechanism. It remains to be seen whether it will remain unique. After a while, new requirements for further debts will appear.\n\nAnd this will lead to contradictions. Critics both in France and in my country, of course, will say that this is a dam break. Today they borrow, and tomorrow someone will want to borrow again. I think this is one of the risks you are taking.\n\nI personally think that having weighed everything, it\u2019s right to take risks.\n\nQuestion from France: Is this the best initiative?\n\nYou can put down lots of possibilities on a blank piece of paper. I think this is a very good initiative. But many questions remain open. The package\u2019s effectiveness will depend on how long it lasts. We must remember that EU decisions need to be ratified.\n\nThis begs the question: should it be ratified? Could it be that we will have a long-term ratification process, and these funds will come when the crisis has long ended? One can only hope that everyone understands this; there is an urgency for everyone involved.\n\nBut these are all open questions. This concept should be specified.\n\nThe EU needs to show signs of life. The fund should be created and it should become successful because it\u2019s very difficult to imagine that the EU won\u2019t do anything in this crisis. Critics will need to be convinced by showing that added value is created for everyone.\n\nQuestion from Ukraine: is \u20ac500 billion a lot?\n\n\u20ac500 billion amounts to about three percent of the EU\u2019s GDP, maybe a little more. This is the amount paid over several years. This means that this is not a giant fiscal package, but it is a lot of money, first of all, compared to the current EU budget, which is a little more than one percent of GDP per year. For three years, this would be a doubling of costs.\n\nThe money should go to European programmes and it will be spent as part of the EU budget. Compared to what we are doing in Europe today, what is the EU budget, this is a lot of money.\n\nCompared to national budgets, this, of course, is not that much. But the concept that money needs to be spent correctly is more important than the amount.

Russia, however, started to build up its reserves long before the crisis emerged.\n\nRussia has become a saviour of the global gold markets as the pandemic has spurred abnormally high demand for the precious metal while it has at the same time also crippled companies' ability to produce gold in the amounts requested by market players, the vice president of Russian gold industry giant Zolotoy Monetnyy Dom, Alexey Vyazovsky, says.\n\n\"When a pandemic or war emerges, gold is everyone's first choice to buy. But right now buying gold is problematic. Refineries where gold alloys are purified, mints where gold coins are minted, some banks and exchanges, all infrastructure, including even some mines are closed due to quarantine\", Vyazovsky says.\n\nThe gold expert explains that Russia mines some 300 tonnes of gold each year and has huge amounts of gold stashed in reserves - something that is now saving the market. Vyazovsky stresses that the Russian government has allowed companies to export gold, with the main flows of the precious metal now going to the two main European gold hubs - London and Switzerland - which were experiencing acute shortages of physical gold.\n\nThis situation turned out to be highly profitable for Russian gold companies, the expert notes.\n\n\"Gold prices are on the rise in Russia as it's traded in rubles. So now the gold-mining companies are getting incredible profits\", Vyazovsky says.\n\nRussia has indeed been boosting its gold reserves for some time and started doing so long before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. When Moscow started dumping its holdings of US Treasury bonds, it also started buying the precious metal, supposedly as a replacement for its dollar-nominated assets. In 2019, Russia became the biggest gold buyer in the world, closely followed by China.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":1944,"url":"https:\/\/dcgazette.com\/2020\/update-20-yr-old-boxer-was-moved-to-michigan-nursing-home-because-he-had-coronavirus-beat-77-yr-old-veteran-and-was-still-there-a-week-later\/","publisher":"DC Gazette","publish_date":"2020-05-23","author":[],"title":"UPDATE: 20-Yr-Old Boxer Was Moved to Michigan Nursing Home BECAUSE HE HAD CORONAVIRUS! \u2014 Beat 77 Yr-Old Veteran And WAS STILL THERE A WEEK LATER \u22c6 Dc Gazette","image":"https:\/\/static.thegatewaypundit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1378-1-600x334.jpg","body_text":"This Brutal Event Is Even Worse Than We Thought!\n\nNumerous disturbing videos circulated social media on Thursday showing a black Michigan man beating an elderly white man and an elderly white woman in a nursing home.\n\nJaydon Hayden, reportedly from Westland, Michigan filmed himself beating elderly white nursing home patients for sport.\n\nThere were three videos on Bitchute showing the man beating white elderly men and women.\n\nThe man filmed himself beating the seniors in their beds until they were bleeding.\n\nAbsolutely shocking footage has emerged from a black male nurse from Detroit (Jadon H.), who filmed himself beating elderly white men into a bloody pulp. \u201cGet the fuck off my bed, N.,\u201d he is heard saying.

The national lockdown will continue until 31 May, with some relaxation to industrial, construction, and other service sectors.\n\n\"Industry is already facing a deep crisis for want of demand and likely labour challenges that might come in near future due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ghani was awarded the victory but Abdullah rejected the outcome and formed a parallel cabinet.\n\nHopes are that the newly found unity will help the Afghan government get the country back on track toward stability. Abdullah will now lead negotiations with Taliban insurgents that aim to end decades of fighting as the country struggles to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nObstacles Remain\n\nThe power-sharing deal will likely strengthen the government's hand in the future talks with the Taliban but it cannot resolve the current stalemate, Marvin Weinbaum, the director for Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said.\n\n\"Certainly, without a deal the government side would find itself in a decidedly weak bargaining position. But while the compromise deal may serve the need for the unity needed by the Afghan regime, it has not in any substantial way removed the obstacles that block progress toward reaching a peace agreement with the Taliban,\" he said.\n\nThe deal is unlikely to change the Taliban's perception of the Afghan government as a US \"puppet,\" while Ghani's decision to resume the offensive against the militants after the hospital and funeral attacks \u2014 most likely carried out by the affiliate of Daesh* (also known as ISIS\/IS\/Islamic State, banned as a terror group in Russia) \u2014 could be another setback to the peace process.\n\nUneasy Peace\n\nJabeur Fathally, a professor of international and comparative law at the University of Ottawa in Canada, said the Afghan president and his top negotiator apparently put their rivalry aside to avoid armed clashes between their supporters but their core differences remained and could be exploited by the Taliban.\n\n\"This agreement will calm and ease the tension between the supporters of these two personalities and will certainly allow the resumption of dialogue with the Taliban but we will see in the next few months that the two personalities will not have the same agendas, objectives and strategies towards the Taliban,\" Fathally said.\n\nThe expert warned that insurgents will try to play on the simmering tensions between the two political heavyweights to weaken them and impose their conditions in the intra-Afghan negotiations.\n\nRobert Jervis, a professor of international politics in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University in New York, said that infighting between the two Afghan leaders could reemerge later in the negotiating process to the detriment of the peace efforts.\n\n\"Having Abdullah lead the delegation in negotiations with the Taliban may (slightly) increase the chance of reaching an agreement by giving multiple factions in the government incentives to work out a deal. The danger, of course, is that Ghani will be given reason to object to anything that Abdullah puts forward,\" he said.\n\nWhat About the Pandemic?\n\nThe power-sharing agreement is likely to boost the government's response to the coronavirus epidemic, which has infected almost 10,000 people and killed more than 200 across Afghanistan.\n\n\"The agreement allows for a coordinated public health response to the pandemic that was not possible under the backdrop of a political infighting that had distracted the government from focusing on the health challenge,\" Marvin Weinbaum said.\n\nWeinbaum added that mounting a successful campaign to contain the spread of the disease would be \"exceedingly difficult\" without a nationwide ceasefire with the Taliban, whose efforts to address the epidemic in areas under their control have been limited at best.\n\nJabeur Fathally said the deal was not going to change a lot in Afghanis' daily life but would allow the Afghan government to have more access to international relief aid, particularly from the United States and the European Union.\n\n*Daesh, also known as ISIS\/IS\/Islamic State, is a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.","news_guard_score":12.5,"mbfc_level":"Very low","political_bias":"Right","country":"Russia","reliability":0},{"news_id":2008,"url":"http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/viral\/202005241079404645-alyssa-milano-ridiculed-for-wearing-knitted-see-through-mask-with-invisible-carbon-filter\/","publisher":"Sputnik News","publish_date":"2020-05-24","author":[],"title":"Alyssa Milano Ridiculed for Wearing Knitted See-Through Mask With 'Invisible' Carbon Filter","image":"https:\/\/cdn2.img.sputniknews.com\/images\/107670\/79\/1076707951.jpg","body_text":"Actress-turned social activist Alyssa Milano is not new to social media spats, however this time, rather uniquely, she ended up in netizens\u2019 crosshairs because of a tiny - but vital - accessory.\n\nAlyssa Milano has posted a snapshot of her family before a joint outing, and it all would have gone smoothly, but for her face mask, which turned out to be crocheted, and, expectedly, see-through.\n\nInternet users instantly picked up on this small detail, taking note of the mask's style, remarking that the rest of the family rightly opted for more conventional material.\n\n\u201cSo knitted face mask [sic] are going to protect you from COVID-19 Alyssa Milano you are a special kind of stupid #alyssamilano\", one fumed, with another weighing in:\n\n\u201cHaven't had a chance to pick up a mask but looks like this will do\u2026..\", the user wrote provocatively posting a picture of himself with a metal sieve pressed against his face.\n\nMilano wasted no time attempting to hit back at the openly laughing netizens, justifying her choice:\n\n\u201cA**holes, mask has a carbon filter in it.

The experience tested bonds of love under the stress of cohabitation, and he believes they have passed the test.\n\nThe Toniolo family make a toast, clinking their glasses at home after cooking homemade ravioli. Toniolo, a 35-year-old elementary school teacher, his wife Chiara, 32, and their daughter, were staying in his grandparents' house in San Fiorano, a small town in northern Italy. They had moved from Milan, found jobs in local schools, and were waiting for their house in the town to be ready for moving in. Toniolo's father, Massimo, 62, was visiting from Sardinia.\n\nA group of young people hang out listening to dance music on a boombox, by a train track. On Feb. 21, San Fiorano became part of the \"red zone\", a cluster of towns sealed off in what turned out to be a futile attempt to contain the virus.\n\nMarzio takes a selfie as his daughter Bianca holds his face while they play \u201cmother and baby\u201d on a rainy day at home. \"The worst moment was when the first person in San Fiorano died. I know the son. I was already under a lot of stress,\" Toniolo said. \"That night, I almost had a panic attack and took a tranquiliser for the first time in years.\"\n\nOn the fourteenth day of quarantine, Marzio\u2019s grandmother Ines Prandini, 85, restarted an old alarm clock she's had for 30 years to \"give some sound to this time, to give some life to this time\" at home. The clampdown later was extended to cover all of Italy. After about a month, Toniolo's father returned home to Sardinia.\n\nMarzio and his grandfather Gino play a game of cards at home. Things began settling down. But the real concern was Gino, who suffers from short-term memory loss. \"At the start, we were really afraid and did not let him go out. My grandmother used to go to church but when my grandfather started getting worse, she stopped,\" Toniolo said.\n\nGino and his wife Ines sleep at home on the 16th day of quarantine. Gino would go to bed early and wake up at 10 p.m. convinced it was breakfast time. He could not understand why he had to stay inside and \"coronavirus\" meant nothing to him, so the family told him the Spanish Flu had returned.\n\nMarzio's family gather to watch a live broadcast of Pope Francis giving an extraordinary global blessing to an empty St. Peter's Square, where he urged the world to see the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis as a test of solidarity and a reminder of basic values. The Spanish flu hit between 1918-1920 and people of Gino's generation heard accounts about it when they were young. \"He knew what that was and he started to understand,\" Toniolo said.\n\nGino goes for a walk close to his home. Gino now wears a mask and goes for a walk, sitting on a bench while neighbours keep a discreet, watchful eye. Bianca also helps Gino adapt. \"No, grandpa, there's coronavirus about. You can't kiss me!\" she told him.\n\nMarzio takes a picture as he participates in a video conference call with colleagues and the headmaster of the primary school where he teaches, to see how everybody's classes are doing. Toniolo and his wife Chiara send their students lessons and homework project via the internet. On Sunday, Italy announced a gradual easing of restrictions.\n\nMarzio takes a picture of Bianca painting his toenails.\n\nStory Toniolo, his wife and daughter look forward to moving into their new home when possible, knowing that, if needed, they are just metres away from the older generation. It will continue to be a family affair.","news_guard_score":100,"mbfc_level":"Very high","political_bias":"Center","country":"UK","reliability":1},{"news_id":2021,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/2020\/world\/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus\/","publisher":"The Washington Post","publish_date":"","author":[],"title":"Mapping the worldwide spread of the coronavirus","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/resizer\/gcWHmR-qZ7QrVwmn9MFEKvB6PWM=\/1200x630\/filters:focal(759x506:1541x1027):quality(100)\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost\/public\/NJHA3652IBFDXKDA5COXNGES4A.jpg","body_text":"World Mapping the worldwide spread of the coronavirus Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript.

The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.\n\nThe U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories. As more tests are performed, many states are seeing rapid growth in the number of known cases.\n\nReported cases Reported deaths\n\n[A more detailed look at the virus's spread through U.S. counties and states]\n\nIn the early months, China, where the outbreak originated last year, reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.\n\nWhile the virus appears to have plateaued or declined in much of Europe, many countries in South America, South Asia and the Middle East have reported increases in the number of cases.\n\n[What you need to know about coronavirus]\n\nAs the disease waned in China, it began to surge in Italy and Spain.

Possible penalties include fines, suspensions or even revoking a business\u2019 liquor permit.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know the compliance rate out there,\u201d Ohio Investigative Unit Enforcement Commander Eric Wolf said. \u201cWe certainly expect that a vast majority of the places we visit will be in compliance and do what they have to do.\u201d\n\nGov. Mike DeWine announced May 18 that members would be added to the investigative unit to check for compliance at bars and restaurants.\n\nWolf said the undercover agents don\u2019t have a set checklist, but they will look for things such as groups larger than 10, patrons congregating in open areas or around the bar or people using pool tables and video games -- all things still not allowed under the state health order.\n\nThis will be in addition to their normal duties, like checking for underage alcohol sales and over serving, Wolf said.\n\nTo help the unit as bars and restaurants reopen their dining rooms, Wolf said the agency is adding the help of sworn officers from other agencies. Officers from the Ohio Casino Control Commission will be teaming up with the Ohio Investigative Unit. Locally, the Stark County Sheriff\u2019s Office will be pairing deputies with agents as well, Wolf said.\n\nThe agents generally work in pairs, Wolf said, and the extra help will let them about double the amount of teams they can send out. In an ideal situation where businesses are following the rules, Wolf said officers would \u201cleave without an establishment knowing we were even there.\u201d\n\nWolf said the two main goals are observation and education. If a business is doing mostly everything right but has one or two problems, he said an officer would likely just address the issue, and help the owners comply.\n\nHe said a big part of enforcing the health order is making sure patrons also know what they need to do to comply and be safe.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re trying to get the message out that it\u2019s the patrons' responsibility as well,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nOfficers have been doing similar checks while bars and restaurants reopened patios. Wolf said by-and-large, the agency saw very few incidents in which they had to issue violations.\n\nIf there is an issue that rises to a violation, Wolf said it would be filed against the business\u2019 liquor permit, and lead to a hearing with the liquor control commission.\n\nAgents will not be shutting down businesses, he said.\n\nThe biggest question is what businesses will look like as they reopen. Wolf said people will likely fall into two camps: those who aren\u2019t ready to dine in yet, and those who are cooped up and ready to get out of the house. He said it\u2019s hard to know how many people will fall in each category.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious as just about anyone out there on what\u2019s going to happen this weekend,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWolf said the Ohio Investigative Unit has committed to bringing on extra officers for at least two weeks. Wolf said this will let them spread out as much as they can, and help people comply, if necessary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest push is just more observation and education, and to make sure that everyone has a good and safe holiday weekend,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nReach Akron Beacon Journal reporter Sean McDonnell at smcdonnell@thebeaconjournal.com or 330-996-3186.\n\n\n\nThis story was reported by the Akron Beacon Journal, part of the USA Today network.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Akron Beacon Journal: Undercover agents enforcing state health rules at restaurants, bars","news_guard_score":29.5,"mbfc_level":"Low","political_bias":"Right","country":"USA","reliability":0}]
